The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure measure measure measure measure measure measure measure measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
