Clarke's nucleus is the origin of the dorsal spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar spinocerebellar tract, a way in which stretch receptor and other mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive mechanoreceptive information from the leg reaches the ipsilateral cerebellar vermis and intermediate zone.
