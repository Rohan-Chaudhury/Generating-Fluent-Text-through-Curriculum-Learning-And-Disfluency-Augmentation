Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler simpler simpler simpler simpler simpler simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an an an an an an an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
