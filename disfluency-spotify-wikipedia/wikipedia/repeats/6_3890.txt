The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of neural ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles in the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
