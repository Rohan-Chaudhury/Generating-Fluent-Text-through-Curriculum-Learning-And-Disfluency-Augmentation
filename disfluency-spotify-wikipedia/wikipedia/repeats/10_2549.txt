Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip chip chip chip chip chip chip chip chip chip chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to to to to to to to to to to to stabilize the temperature, and by making small adjustments to the the the the the the the the the the the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
