Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
