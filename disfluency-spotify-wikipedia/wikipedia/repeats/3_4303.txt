The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on on on on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible possible possible possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these these these these sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
