A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave shortwave shortwave shortwave shortwave shortwave shortwave shortwave shortwave shortwave troughs, which are of smft within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.
