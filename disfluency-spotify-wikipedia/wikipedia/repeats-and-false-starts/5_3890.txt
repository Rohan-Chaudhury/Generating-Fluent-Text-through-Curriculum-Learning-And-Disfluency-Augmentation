The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of of of of of of neural ensembles in the cerebral cortex, comprising large large large large large large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
