Resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
