The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and and and and and and and and and and and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that that that that that that that that that that that these sensors would not be able to distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
