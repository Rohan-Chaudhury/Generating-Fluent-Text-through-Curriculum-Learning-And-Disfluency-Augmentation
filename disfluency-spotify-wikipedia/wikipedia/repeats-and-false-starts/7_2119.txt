In this in this in this in this in this in this in this in this method, building blocks are protected by all reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive functional groups and two functional groups in which the the the the the the the the reaction occurs between building blocks in the solution and on on on on on on on on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
