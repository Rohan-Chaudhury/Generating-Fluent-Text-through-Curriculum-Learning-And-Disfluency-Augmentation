The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the the the the the the the the the the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors would not not not not not not not not not not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
