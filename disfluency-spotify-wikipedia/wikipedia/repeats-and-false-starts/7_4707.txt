Titled 'If I Never Stop Lovin' You', You', You', You', You', You', You', You', Kersh's second album featured the song 'I Breathe In, I I I I I I I I Breathe Out', which although never a single for Kersh himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, later became a No. 1 single for Chris Cagle in early 2002.
