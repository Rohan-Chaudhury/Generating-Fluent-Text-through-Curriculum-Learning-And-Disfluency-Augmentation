Actin is a globular protein (~ 43 kDa) which polymerizes polymerizes polymerizes polymerizes polymerizes polymerizes polymerizes polymerizes polymerizes and forms into an ordered filament structure which has two protofilaments protofilaments protofilaments protofilaments protofilaments protofilaments protofilaments protofilaments protofilaments wrapping around each other, to form a single 'actin filament' ( previously referred to as 'microfilament' ).
