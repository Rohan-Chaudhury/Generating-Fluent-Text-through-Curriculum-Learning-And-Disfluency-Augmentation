The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on on on on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel wheel wheel wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors sensors sensors sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from from from from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
