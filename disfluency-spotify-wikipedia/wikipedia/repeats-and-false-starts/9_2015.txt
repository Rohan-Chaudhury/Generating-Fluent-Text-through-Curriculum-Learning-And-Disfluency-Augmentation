In current studies it has been determined that epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic epiphytic bacteria generally don't harm the plant, but promote the formation formation formation formation formation formation formation formation formation formation of ice crystals, and some produce an auxin auxin auxin auxin auxin auxin auxin auxin auxin auxin hormone which promotes plant growth and plays a role in the life cycle of the bacteria.
