Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
