In this method, building blocks are protected protected protected protected protected protected protected protected protected protected by all reactive functional groups and two functional functional functional functional functional functional functional functional functional functional groups in which the reaction occurs between building blocks in in in in in in in in in in the solution and on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
