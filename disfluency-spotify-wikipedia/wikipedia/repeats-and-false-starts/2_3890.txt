The activity of neurons generate electric currents; currents; currents; and the synchronous action of neural ensembles in the the the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic macroscopic macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
