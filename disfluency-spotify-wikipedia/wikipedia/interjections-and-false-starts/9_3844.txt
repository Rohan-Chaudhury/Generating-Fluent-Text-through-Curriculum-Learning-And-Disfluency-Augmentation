The State of Nebraska halted the liquor licensing process before the 2006 season, and the organizers I mean um you know like I mean uh okay well I mean were forced to modify the rules for vending of alcoholic beverages for the 2006 um uh um you know so so like um I mean festival season, and forced compliance in order for the festival to receive the required liquor licence.
