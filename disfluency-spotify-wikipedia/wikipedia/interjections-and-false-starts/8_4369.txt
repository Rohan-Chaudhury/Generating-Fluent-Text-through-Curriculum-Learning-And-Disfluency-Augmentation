The singer's laconic banter and corny jokes are also on like well well uh like like so you know full display, but the album is most remarkable for the intimacy you know you know so well I mean I mean I mean you know of the performance, with Van Zandt taking the stage okay so well okay you know I mean so you know alone and accompanying himself on guitar as he did thousands of times during his career.
