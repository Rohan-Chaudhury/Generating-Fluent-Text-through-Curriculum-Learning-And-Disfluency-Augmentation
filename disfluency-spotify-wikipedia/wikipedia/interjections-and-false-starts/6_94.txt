A music video for their song 'The Big Picture' okay um well you know you know well was made, but the only member of the band like so like I mean so uh featured was Amos, since by then, unable to withstand pressure from uh I mean okay uh so so Atlantic Records she had jettisoned the entire band with the exception of Steve Caton.
