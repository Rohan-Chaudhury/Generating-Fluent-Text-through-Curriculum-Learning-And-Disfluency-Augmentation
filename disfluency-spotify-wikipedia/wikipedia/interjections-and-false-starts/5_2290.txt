It was formed during several episodes of quaternary glaciation when uh so like like you know sea levels were much lower - the analysis of okay you know so like like stalactites found in Great Blue Hole shows that formation so I mean okay well um took place 153, 000, 66, 000, 60, 000, and 15, 000 years ago.
