Largely due to the poor economic conditions of New Haven well I mean like well in the 1970s and 1980s, 'The Record' sputtered along, you know okay you know okay foundered and was revived numerous times during the 1970s um uh um like and 1980s, but in 1990, Michael Gerber revived 'The Record' for good.
