The screenplay by Don Ettlinger and Karl Tunberg is loosely based on Kate Douglas Wiggin's 'Rebecca like you know you know well I mean I mean well you know well you know of Sunnybrook Farm' and tells the story of a talented orphan's trials and tribulations after winning a radio audition to represent a breakfast cereal.
