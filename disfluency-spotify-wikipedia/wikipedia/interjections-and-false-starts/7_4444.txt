The traditional territories of the Musqueam and um well well you know uh uh I mean Tsleil'waututh lie completely within the region; the southern I mean okay like you know I mean okay okay portion of Skwxwu7mesh (Squamish) traditional territory is also in the region -- well well so well you know like I mean its claims overlap those of the Tsleil - waututh, Musqueam, and Kwekwitlem.
