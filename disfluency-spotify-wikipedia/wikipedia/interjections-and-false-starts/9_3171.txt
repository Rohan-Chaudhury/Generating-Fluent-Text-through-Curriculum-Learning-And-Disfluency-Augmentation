Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used so well well so uh I mean okay like like for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is um like um okay so so like I mean okay to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; okay so uh like I mean okay so I mean so both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
