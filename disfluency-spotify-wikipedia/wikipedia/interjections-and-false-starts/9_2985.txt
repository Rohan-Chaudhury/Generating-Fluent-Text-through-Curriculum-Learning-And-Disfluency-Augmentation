Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was like so so well um uh like I mean well a heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, well uh so okay you know like um um okay which lies very close to most of Illinois so um you know so well so um uh okay 37 (indeed the entire route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
