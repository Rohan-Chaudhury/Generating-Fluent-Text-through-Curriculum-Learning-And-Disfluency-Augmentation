The fight the fight the fight the fight continued the following day, August 23, with four 'blue jackets' so you know I mean and 14 warriors wounded (one of them killed), until um well I mean Nokoni and Kiowa retreated, burning the prairie and I mean like well killing some white men near Anadarko and along the Beaver Creek.
