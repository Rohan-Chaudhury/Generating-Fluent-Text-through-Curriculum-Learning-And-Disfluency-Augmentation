Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was a okay I mean um I mean you know you know so so like well heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, which lies very uh okay I mean I mean so well you know you know um um close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed like like okay well like uh um uh okay you know the entire route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
