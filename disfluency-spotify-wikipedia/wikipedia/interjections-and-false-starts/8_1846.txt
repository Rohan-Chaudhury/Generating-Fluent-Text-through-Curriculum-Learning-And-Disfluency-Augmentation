In 1983, the Bronco saw a slight facelift as I mean uh you know like like you know you know well it adopted Ford's blue oval emblem, taking so um uh I mean I mean well like okay the place of 'F - O - R - uh well you know like well like well you know D' lettering on the hood, and the bronco horse was removed from the fender emblems.
