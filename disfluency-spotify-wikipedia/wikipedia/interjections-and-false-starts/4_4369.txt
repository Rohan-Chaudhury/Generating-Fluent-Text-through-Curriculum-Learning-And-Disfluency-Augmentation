The singer's laconic banter and corny jokes are also on okay well okay so full display, but the album is most remarkable I mean you know you know okay for the intimacy of the performance, with Van Zandt taking uh well you know so the stage alone and accompanying himself on guitar as he did thousands of times during his career.
