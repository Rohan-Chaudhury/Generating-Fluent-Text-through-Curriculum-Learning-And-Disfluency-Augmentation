Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for okay uh like so well you know so the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is to so I mean I mean well like so okay use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light well like you know I mean like well like bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
