The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the you know um you know well I mean railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are like so okay um um flawed in the sense that these sensors like you know uh like like would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
