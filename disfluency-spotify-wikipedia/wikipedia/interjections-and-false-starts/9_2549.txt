Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted okay you know like okay uh you know like okay like on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by so I mean uh so okay well well okay well making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
