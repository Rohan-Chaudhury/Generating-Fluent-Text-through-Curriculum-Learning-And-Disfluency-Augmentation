Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted well so uh like okay um on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and okay well um you know like um by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of well so well so okay you know the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
