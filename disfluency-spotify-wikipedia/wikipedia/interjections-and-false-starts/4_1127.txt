Four months later, Gilberto Rodr√≠guez was recaptured by Colombian authorities okay like like so in Cali during March 2004, accused of having well I mean like you know shipped 150 kilograms of cocaine to the US well uh you know like in 1990, a crime which he had not previously confessed and therefore allowed for his new arrest.
