If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, you know I mean well like like provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is you know like you know I mean like significantly greater than the coupling coefficient, then much of you know um uh okay so the power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
