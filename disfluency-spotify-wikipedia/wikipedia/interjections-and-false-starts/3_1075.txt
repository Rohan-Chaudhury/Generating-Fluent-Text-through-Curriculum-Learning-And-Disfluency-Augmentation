Flashlights used for extended periods every day may be more economically operated on rechargeable (secondary) um you know so batteries. Fleshlights designed for rechargeable batteries may allow charging without removing the batteries; for example, like well I mean a light kept in a vehicle may be trickle - charged and always ready when needed.
