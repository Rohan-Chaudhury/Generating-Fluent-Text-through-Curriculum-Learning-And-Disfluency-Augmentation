Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted I mean you know okay well like well uh like okay um on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and so well so you know I mean okay you know like like um by making small adjustments to the inside temperature well I mean okay um I mean um you know you know you know well of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
