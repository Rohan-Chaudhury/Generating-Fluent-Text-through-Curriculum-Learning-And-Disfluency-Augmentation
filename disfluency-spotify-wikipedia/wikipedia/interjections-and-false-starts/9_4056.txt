The first, on 1st violins and violas, is like um okay okay I mean um well okay I mean okay the winds of a graveyard; the second, played by oboes, is I mean well um like um I mean like you know I mean slower and more melancholic; the third theme is played by the cor anglais accompanied by a lugubrious marching rhythm.
