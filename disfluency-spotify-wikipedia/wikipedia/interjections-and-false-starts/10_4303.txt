The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded well you know so like so you know I mean like like like on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel I mean you know so um so you know so I mean well I mean impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors uh you know well uh like you know you know like uh like would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
