The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure you know so uh okay so you know you know well uh um vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors like you know like okay okay well you know uh I mean well would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
