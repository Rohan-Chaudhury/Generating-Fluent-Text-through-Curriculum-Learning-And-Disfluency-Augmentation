Instead of a banked oval track, a figure eight track was I mean um uh well well I mean uh uh used where one side heavily banked, and included obstacles such like you know um well like okay you know so as the 'Wall of Death' (which was located I mean okay um I mean like you know so well on the heavily banked side) and the 'Jet Jump'.
