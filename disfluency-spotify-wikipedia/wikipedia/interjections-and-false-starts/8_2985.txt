Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it I mean you know uh okay well so like okay was a heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, um so you know uh so like I mean well which lies very close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed okay okay well well okay uh uh uh the entire route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
