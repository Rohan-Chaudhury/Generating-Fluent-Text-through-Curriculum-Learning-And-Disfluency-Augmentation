The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (often shortened to TMNT or Ninja so well you know so like Turtles) are a team of four teenage anthropomorphic turtles, named so okay um you know I mean after four Renaissance Italian artists, who were trained by their anthropomorphic rat sensei in the art of ninjutsu.
