Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was uh uh well well so well I mean a heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, I mean okay I mean okay like well well which lies very close to most of Illinois 37 you know well okay uh you know um like (indeed the entire route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
