The couple only used parts of the ground floor and sadly the rest of the house uh okay so well I mean um well okay uh became little more than a ruin - until in 1986 Cornelia Bayley (the present um so you know like you know um I mean you know so owner) bought Plas Teg for £ 750, 000 which included a grant of £ 250, 000 from CADW.
