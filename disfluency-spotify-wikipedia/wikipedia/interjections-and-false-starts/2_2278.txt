It was concluded that this crash was a I mean like type known as C. F. I. T. (Controlled Flight Into okay um Terrain) and that there were no defects with so like the aircraft or its systems which contributed to the crash, uh I mean for this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain.
