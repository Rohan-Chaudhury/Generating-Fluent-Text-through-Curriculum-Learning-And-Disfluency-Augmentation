Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used okay well um well you know uh well uh for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional I mean um you know okay um you know uh uh solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent uh okay okay uh uh well so um light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
