If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, provided I mean you know like well well I mean the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly uh okay so um well I mean greater than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power well well I mean well so well can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
