Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is like like okay I mean okay so like okay mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, I mean I mean uh uh uh you know like um and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of well uh I mean uh okay well well uh the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
