Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, well okay um I mean you know but a simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor I mean well so so so or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
