Resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used um okay well you know well you know well I mean I mean you know for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution uh so well like I mean I mean uh well uh I mean is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; I mean uh I mean uh like okay uh you know well I mean both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
