Instead of a banked oval track, a figure well um like like you know um you know eight track was used where one side heavily banked, I mean um okay like well so you know and included obstacles such as the 'Wall of Death' so I mean so well uh okay okay (which was located on the heavily banked side) and the 'Jet Jump'.
