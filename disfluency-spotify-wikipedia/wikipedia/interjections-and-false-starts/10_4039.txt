The film's music score was composed by Cyril J. Mockridge; but I mean well I mean um I mean I mean so you know uh well in scenes involving Hallie's relationships with Doniphon and Stoddard, well I mean uh uh okay okay like well um so Ford reprised Alfred Newman's 'Ann Rutledge Theme', from 'Young Mr. Lincoln'.
