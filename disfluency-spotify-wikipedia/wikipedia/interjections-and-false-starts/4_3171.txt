Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used so I mean so so for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is to you know so I mean uh use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both I mean so you know um provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
