The Ancient Church of the East ( ' ʿĒtā you know um uh ʿAttīqtā d'Maḏnəḥā', ) is a continuation in the like you know so traditions of the Church of the East, one of uh well so the oldest Christian churches whose origins so so I mean trace back to the See of Seleucia - Ctesiphon in central Mesopotamia.
