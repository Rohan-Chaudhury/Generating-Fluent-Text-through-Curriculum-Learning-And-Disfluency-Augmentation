It was concluded that this crash was a so you know okay you know um so type known as C. F. I. T. (Controlled uh I mean well I mean like like Flight Into Terrain) and that there were no defects so I mean you know I mean well you know with the aircraft or its systems which contributed to the crash, so okay um like you know um for this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain.
