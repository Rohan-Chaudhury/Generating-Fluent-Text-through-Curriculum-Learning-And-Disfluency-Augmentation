It was concluded that this crash was a type known as C. F well like um you know um you know. I. T. (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) and that there were no defects with the aircraft uh okay well you know um uh or its systems which contributed to the crash, for this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain.
