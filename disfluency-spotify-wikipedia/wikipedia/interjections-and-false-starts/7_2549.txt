Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser I mean so like like well uh okay chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the um you know you know okay like like you know temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside like well so okay so like like temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
