One particular defender of the idea of species selection uh you know um okay um okay I mean like I mean is S. J. Gould who has proposed the view that there so um you know like you know um uh I mean I mean exist macroevolutionary processes which shape evolution beyond the level uh I mean uh I mean uh like well like I mean of species and are not driven by the microevolutionary mechanisms already characterized by evolutionary biologists.
