Burgoyne had gained the field of battle, but so you know well I mean I mean suffered nearly 600 casualties, mostly in Hamilton's centre column, where okay like uh uh so the 62nd was reduced to the size of a single company so well like well like and three quarters of the artillery men were killed or wounded.
