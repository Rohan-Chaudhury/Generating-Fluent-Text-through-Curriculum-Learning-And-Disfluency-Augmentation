One of only two actors to audition, like you know I mean uh well you know well he was cast as Chekov almost immediately okay so I mean uh so I mean um primarily because of his resemblance to British actor / so you know so like I mean uh you know musician Davy Jones of the Monkees; show creator Gene Roddenberry so well okay okay um okay uh hoped that Koenig would increase the show's appeal to young people.
