On 12 June 1808, while Lasalle was on uh like so you know his way to Valladolid, in the village of Cabezón, okay well uh okay he met a resistance of about 7, 000 men um I mean I mean okay under General Cuesta, deployed along the Cabezón bridge to bar the road to Burgos against oncoming French divisions.
