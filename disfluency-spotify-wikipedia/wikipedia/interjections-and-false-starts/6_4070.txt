The first post-war model was the 1948 Mark V I mean okay okay you know so uh available with either 2. 5 - or 3. 5 - well well uh well you know okay litre engines, and it had a more streamlined appearance so you know so um like okay than pre-war models, but more important was the change to independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes.
