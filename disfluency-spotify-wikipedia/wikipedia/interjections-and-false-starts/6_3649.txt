The British discovered Pau and its climate and left their imprint, partly because Wellington left well I mean okay well uh like a garrison there in 1814 after defeating Marshal Soult at Orthez (some 40 km to I mean well well well okay so the NW) on his way into France from Spain towards the end of the Peninsular War.
