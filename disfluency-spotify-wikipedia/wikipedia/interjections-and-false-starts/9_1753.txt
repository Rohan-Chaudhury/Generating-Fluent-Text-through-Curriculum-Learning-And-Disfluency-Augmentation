If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, okay I mean so like well um well so you know provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly greater um well okay I mean well um um you know okay than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power can be absorbed so uh uh well like um I mean well so by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
