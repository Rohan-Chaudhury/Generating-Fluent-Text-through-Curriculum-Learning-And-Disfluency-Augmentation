Hoc is mentioned as the father of Hnæf (d. 450?) and like I mean like um you know okay um well Hildeburh in the Old English poems 'Beowulf' and the 'Finnsburg like you know you know like well like like well Fragment', but he may be a mythical tribal ancestor, because Widsith says that Hnæf ruled over the Hocings.
