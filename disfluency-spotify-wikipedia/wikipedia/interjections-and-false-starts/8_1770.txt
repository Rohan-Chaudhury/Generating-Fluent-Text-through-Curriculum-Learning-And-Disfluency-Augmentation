In 1145, Geoffroy II de Lèves, Bishop of Chartres, excommunicated you know um I mean okay um okay so like Geoffrey, but on his deathbed, he became a monk okay you know uh I mean well uh okay well at Tiron Sainte - Trinité (see Tironensian Order), making peace with the abbey and therefore the bishop.
