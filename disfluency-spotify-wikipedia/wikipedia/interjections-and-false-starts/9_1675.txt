Hoc is mentioned as the father of Hnæf (d. 450?) I mean uh um like um you know so like uh and Hildeburh in the Old English poems 'Beowulf' and the so you know okay well so like um uh well 'Finnsburg Fragment', but he may be a mythical tribal ancestor, because Widsith says that Hnæf ruled over the Hocings.
