It was concluded that this crash was a type known as C. F. I I mean uh okay okay so. T. (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) and that there were no defects with the aircraft or uh uh like like so its systems which contributed to the crash, for this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain.
