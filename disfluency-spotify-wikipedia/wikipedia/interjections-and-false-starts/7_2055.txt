In some cultures, especially in Africa, the letters RSVP, instead of well well I mean you know uh well okay standing for regrets' répondez s'il vous plaît', are there to reassure okay so um you know you know so well the invitee that there would be plenty of food and the event would not be a 'dry one'.
