This can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed well like you know I mean so so like like well you know on a surface - the STM image may appear well you know um I mean uh well okay you know um like to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at well okay you know I mean you know well I mean you know so okay that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
