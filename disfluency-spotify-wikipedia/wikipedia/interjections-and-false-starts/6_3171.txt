Resistor - diode networks and FETs are so well okay uh okay so sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler I mean um uh okay like okay traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary okay you know um like so I mean incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
