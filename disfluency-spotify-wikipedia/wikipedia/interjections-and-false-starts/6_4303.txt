The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the like well so like like I mean railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions well so okay I mean well okay are flawed in the sense that these sensors would well well um you know okay you know not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
