As the storm tracked eastward into Indiana, it became you know so uh I mean uh okay a derecho and wind gusts increased substantially, peaking I mean okay well I mean so well as high as 91 mph (147 km / h) so so well okay so like in Fort Wayne, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, at least in gusts.
