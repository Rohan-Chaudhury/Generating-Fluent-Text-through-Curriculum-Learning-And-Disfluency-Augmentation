Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted I mean so you know on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, I mean uh you know and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature you know okay um of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
