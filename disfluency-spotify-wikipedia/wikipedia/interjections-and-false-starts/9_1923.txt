In 2015/16 they faced eventual winners ABC / UMinho in the opening uh I mean uh uh I mean like like well okay round but their domestic campaign ended with a 5th place like so so okay uh like I mean well you know finish and therefore the team missed out on a EHF Challenge Cup place for the 2016/17 season.
