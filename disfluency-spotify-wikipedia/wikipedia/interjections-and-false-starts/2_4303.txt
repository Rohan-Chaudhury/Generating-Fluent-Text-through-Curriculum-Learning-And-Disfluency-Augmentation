The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded you know you know on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible you know okay wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors you know uh would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
