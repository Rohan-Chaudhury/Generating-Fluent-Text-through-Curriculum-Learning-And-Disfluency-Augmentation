Some cars were fitted with vane - type superchargers, as the three main bearing engine I mean um well well okay okay was liable to crankshaft failure if revved beyond 6, 500 rpm; superchargers I mean well okay uh you know so allowed a TR4 to produce much more horse - power and torque at relatively modest revolutions.
