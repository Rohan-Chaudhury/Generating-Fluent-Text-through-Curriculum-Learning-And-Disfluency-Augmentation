If some if some if some if some if some if some if some if some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, so like I mean so I mean I mean I mean provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly so so uh I mean I mean uh I mean greater than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
