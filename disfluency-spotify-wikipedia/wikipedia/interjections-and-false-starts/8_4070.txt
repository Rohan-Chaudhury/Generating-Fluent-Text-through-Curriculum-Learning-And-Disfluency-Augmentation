The first post-war model was the 1948 Mark V available with either 2. 5 - or uh well okay okay you know so well um 3. 5 - 5- 5- 5- 5- 5- 5- 5- 5- litre engines, and it had a more streamlined appearance than pre-war models, but more important was the change to independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes.
