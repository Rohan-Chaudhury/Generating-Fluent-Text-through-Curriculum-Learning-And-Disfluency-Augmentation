Flashlights used for extended periods every day may be more economically operated on rechargeable (secondary) batteries um okay like I mean so okay. Fleshlights designed for rechargeable batteries may allow charging without removing the batteries; for example, a light um so you know like um um kept in a vehicle may be trickle - charged and always ready when needed.
