Actin is a globular protein (~ 43 kDa) which okay okay I mean so uh well polymerizes and forms into an ordered filament structure which has well I mean well um so uh two protofilaments wrapping around each other, to form a single 'actin um so um you know well well filament' ( previously referred to as 'microfilament' ).
