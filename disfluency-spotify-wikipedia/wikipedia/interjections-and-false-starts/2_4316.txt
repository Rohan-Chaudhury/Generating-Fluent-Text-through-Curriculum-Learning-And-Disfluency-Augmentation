The red - staining inocybe was first described by I mean you know Axel Gudbrand Blytt in 1904 as 'Inocybe erubescens', though well you know was widely known for many years okay okay as 'I. Patouillardii', named by Italian Giacomo Bresadola in 1905 after the French botanist Narcisse Th√©ophile Patouillard.
