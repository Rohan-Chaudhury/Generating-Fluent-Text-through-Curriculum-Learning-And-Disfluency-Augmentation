In the sixth issue, Batman uses a gun loaded with I mean well like like so you know a special 'god - killing' bullet (the kind that I mean I mean you know so well well was used to kill Orion) to slay Darkseid, so uh you know um um uh whether or not the bullet killed Turpin or just the Darkseid entity remains to be seen.
