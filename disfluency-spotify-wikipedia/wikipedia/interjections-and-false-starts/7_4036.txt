The fight continued the following day, August uh you know uh um okay uh um 23, with four 'blue jackets' and 14 warriors wounded (one okay um I mean like so well um of them killed), until Nokoni and Kiowa retreated, uh I mean uh like uh like I mean burning the prairie and killing some white men near Anadarko and along the Beaver Creek.
