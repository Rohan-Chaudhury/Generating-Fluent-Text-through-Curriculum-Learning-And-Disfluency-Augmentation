Rapid growth of industry drastically changed the city itself - by the early 1960s like so um uh I mean so the population exceeded the 100, 000 mark (three times bigger than the pre-World so okay I mean you know um like War II population), and by 1970 it became the largest city in the Vologda Oblast ahead of Vologda itself.
