Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to uh okay um uh like like so to to to to to to to stabilize the temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
