The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of neural ensembles well I mean so you know um well so uh ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles in the cerebral cortex, comprising large well you know uh well so um well um numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
