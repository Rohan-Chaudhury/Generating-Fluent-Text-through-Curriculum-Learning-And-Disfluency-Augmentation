However, it can be difficult to estimate 'K' i i like I mean um okay I mean so so I mean like okay i i i i i i i i i and 'K' i' okay um so you know okay so you know so uh well accurately from such plots, so it it it well uh okay like uh um you know I mean okay like it it it it it it it it is advisable you know so I mean um like um uh I mean I mean okay to estimate these constants using more reliable nonlinear regression methods, as described above.
