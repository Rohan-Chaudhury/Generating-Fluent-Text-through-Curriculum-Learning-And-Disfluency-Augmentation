This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is is uh so so so um okay is is is is is adsorbed on a surface well um okay so so you know - the STM image may appear to have have you know uh okay uh well um have have have have have either INCREASED or DECREASED height well uh you know I mean um you know at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
