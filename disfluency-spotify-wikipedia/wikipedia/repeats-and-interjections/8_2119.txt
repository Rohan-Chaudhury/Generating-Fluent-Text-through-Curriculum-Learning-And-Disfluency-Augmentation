In this method, building blocks are protected by by by uh I mean um um like so you know I mean by by by by by by all reactive functional you know okay like well you know uh uh like groups and two functional groups in in you know so okay you know um you know um I mean in in in in in in in which the I mean um well like well well well uh reaction occurs between building blocks in the solution and um like um you know um well so um on on on on on on on on on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
