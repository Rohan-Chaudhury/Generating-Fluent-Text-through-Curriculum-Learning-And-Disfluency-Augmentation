This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is is well um like you know um is is is is adsorbed on a surface - like uh uh um okay the STM image may may may may may may um you know um well um appear to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height you know um so I mean I mean at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
