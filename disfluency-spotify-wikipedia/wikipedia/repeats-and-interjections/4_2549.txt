Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is is is is well I mean um so is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize stabilize so so well well stabilize stabilize stabilize the temperature, and by making small adjustments so well like you know to the inside inside inside inside inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
