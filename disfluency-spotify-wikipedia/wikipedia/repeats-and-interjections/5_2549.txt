Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler okay so I mean um well cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by making small adjustments you know you know you know you know uh to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
