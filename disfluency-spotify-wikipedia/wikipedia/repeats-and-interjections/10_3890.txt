The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the the I mean I mean okay you know um I mean I mean um you know I mean the the the the the the the the the so I mean like so well uh like I mean so uh synchronous action of neural ensembles in the cerebral cortex, I mean okay okay uh well like uh I mean okay uh cortex, cortex, cortex, cortex, cortex, cortex, cortex, cortex, cortex, cortex, um well so so like I mean well uh I mean um comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
