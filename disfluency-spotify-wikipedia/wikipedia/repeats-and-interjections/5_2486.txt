LTS result in the neuron reaching the threshold threshold threshold so I mean um you know uh threshold threshold threshold for an action potential, and so the spike uh so uh um you know is typically crowned crowned crowned crowned crowned crowned by well okay I mean well um a burst of two to seven action potentials, which is known as a low - threshold burst.
