Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used you know uh um okay like you know like um used used used used used used used used for you know so you know uh you know like okay so the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution solution uh like so so you know um well uh solution solution solution solution solution solution solution is to use so um so well um okay like okay a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light light light you know so um like so so well you know light light light light light light bulb; both provide well I mean like um okay I mean you know uh a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
