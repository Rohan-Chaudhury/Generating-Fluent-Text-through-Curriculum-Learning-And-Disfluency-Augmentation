If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, okay so okay um like so uh okay provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided um okay I mean you know well I mean um well provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly I mean I mean you know okay so okay so uh greater greater greater greater greater greater greater greater greater than so okay you know like I mean like you know well the coupling coefficient, then much of the power can can can well so I mean okay you know um you know okay can can can can can can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
