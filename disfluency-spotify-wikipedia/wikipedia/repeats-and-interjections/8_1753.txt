If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, provided the Q of the so I mean you know uh um well well like the the the the the the the the transmitting circuit is significantly greater so you know uh you know so like okay like than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
