Smith and the officer who fired the fatal shots, Dominique Heaggan - okay you know you know Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, were both African American, and video from the officer's bodycam so um I mean showed that Smith had turned toward the officer with a gun in his hand right before the officer shot him.
