The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded embedded you know um embedded on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and and and I mean um possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense okay like sense sense that these sensors would not be able to um uh to to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
