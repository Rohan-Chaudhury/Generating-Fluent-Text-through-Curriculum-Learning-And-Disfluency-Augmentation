The proof of the upward part of the the uh like okay uh uh like um well um okay the the the the the the the the so well like so so so um okay so okay the theorem also shows that a theory with arbitrarily like you know well um you know okay um I mean like um large finite finite finite finite finite finite finite so uh I mean um so so I mean okay you know so finite finite finite finite models must have an infinite I mean well uh I mean I mean so you know so so you know model; sometimes this is considered to be part of the theorem.
