The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the um the synchronous action of neural ensembles in the well cerebral cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce I mean macroscopic oscillations, which which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
