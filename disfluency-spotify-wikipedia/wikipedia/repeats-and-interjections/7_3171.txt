Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but uh like I mean you know I mean I mean okay a a a a a a a a simpler traditional solution is to use okay you know okay so okay I mean you know a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
