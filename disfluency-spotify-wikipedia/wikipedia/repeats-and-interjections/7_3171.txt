Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the so well I mean I mean um I mean uh the the the the the the the nonlinear element, but a you know um like uh okay like well simpler traditional solution is to use a a a a I mean okay like okay um um I mean a a a a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; um well I mean uh you know well um bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
