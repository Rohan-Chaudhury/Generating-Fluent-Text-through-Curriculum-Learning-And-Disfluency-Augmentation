The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, itself, itself, itself, itself, uh like like well uh well I mean like itself, itself, itself, itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are like I mean I mean okay well okay um uh flawed in the sense sense sense sense sense sense sense sense sense that these sensors like um okay like uh so like like would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
