The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on like like um okay I mean you know you know I mean the railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar so um um so okay I mean well so railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions okay you know well um like well uh like are are are are are are are are are um you know uh so you know like I mean um flawed in the sense that these sensors would not well well uh okay like so okay so not not not not not not not not uh you know I mean like um so you know you know be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
