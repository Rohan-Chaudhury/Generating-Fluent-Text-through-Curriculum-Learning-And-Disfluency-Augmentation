Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes um well I mean I mean used for for for for for the nonlinear element, okay uh you know okay but a simpler traditional solution solution solution solution solution is to um okay so so use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; bulb; okay like so so bulb; bulb; bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
