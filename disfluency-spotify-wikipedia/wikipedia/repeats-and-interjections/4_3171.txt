Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but but but like well I mean you know but but a simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent like like like so light light light light light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
