Additionally, the translation of the word slave is 'sklavos' 'sklavos' so like okay well I mean well like like 'sklavos' 'sklavos' 'sklavos' 'sklavos' 'sklavos' 'sklavos' 'sklavos' and like uh um well you know you know um well not 'doulos' which also shows that Greeks distinguish 'doulos' from slave.
