Some effort has been expended in an attempt to factor these numbers, but okay you know I mean like okay like well like you know much much much much much much much much much much remains unknown about their factorization; for instance, okay well uh um well you know so I mean um it's not known if all numbers in the sequence are squarefree, although all the known terms are.
