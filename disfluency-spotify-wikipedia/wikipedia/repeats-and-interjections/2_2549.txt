Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip chip well um chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the uh like temperature, and and and by making small adjustments to the uh like inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
