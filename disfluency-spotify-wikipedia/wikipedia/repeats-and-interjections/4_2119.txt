In this method, building blocks are protected by well okay well so all reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive functional groups and like you know um um two functional groups in which the reaction occurs occurs uh I mean um I mean occurs occurs occurs between building blocks in the solution and uh you know well uh on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
