Almost all the natural electrical sources are constant voltage voltage I mean like so okay uh so voltage voltage voltage voltage voltage sources (primary and secondary batteries); you know um like uh um well however, there are no convenient, convenient, convenient, convenient, convenient, you know like so uh um like convenient, convenient, constant current sources in nature (excepting inductors, Van der Graaf generators and photodiodes).
