Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used well I mean for the nonlinear element, element, element, but a simpler traditional solution um like is to use use use a thermistor or an um um ordinary incandescent light bulb; both both both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
