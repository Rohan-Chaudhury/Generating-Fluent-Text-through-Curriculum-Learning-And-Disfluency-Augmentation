Power MOSFETs have a different structure than the lateral MOSFET: MOSFET: so you know um uh well uh you know you know so um MOSFET: MOSFET: MOSFET: MOSFET: MOSFET: MOSFET: MOSFET: MOSFET: MOSFET: as you know well well okay so you know okay you know well okay with all power devices, their structure is vertical and not planar.
