Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric um so okay um uh you know okay I mean I mean you know cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler to stabilize the temperature, like I mean well like um um uh okay you know uh and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
