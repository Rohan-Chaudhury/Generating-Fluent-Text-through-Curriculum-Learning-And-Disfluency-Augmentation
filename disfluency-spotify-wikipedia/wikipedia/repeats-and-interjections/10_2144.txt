Instead of a banked oval track, a figure eight track was used where one like like you know I mean uh uh okay like uh I mean side side side side side side side side side side side heavily banked, and included like uh I mean you know you know um like um you know I mean obstacles such as the 'Wall of Death' (which was located on the heavily banked side) and the 'Jet Jump'.
