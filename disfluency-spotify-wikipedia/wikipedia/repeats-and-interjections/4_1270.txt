Hammershøi's work has an aloof austerity ( very very very um I mean like okay very very different than Ilsted's scenes of common life so you know um uh ), and though though though though though sometimes Hammershøi's colorful so you know well so early pictures are reminiscent of Tissot, his work is quintessentially Danish.
