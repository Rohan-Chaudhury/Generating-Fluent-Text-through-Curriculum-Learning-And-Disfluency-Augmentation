The nitride ion (N 3 −) is isoelectronic isoelectronic so um like like I mean like okay okay okay like isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic I mean you know like uh well like um okay so well isoelectronic with the oxide anion, O 2 −, and the the so you know I mean um um you know uh I mean um um the the the the the the the the the um I mean like uh um um like you know you know you know fluoride anion, F − and has an ionic radius estimated to be 140 pm.
