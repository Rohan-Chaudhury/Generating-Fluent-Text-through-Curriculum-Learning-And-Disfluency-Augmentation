This can be shown dramatically when a molecule molecule um so okay you know you know uh so uh well molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule is well uh okay you know okay um I mean um um adsorbed on a surface - the STM image image image image well so like you know um well you know um well image image image image image image may appear to you know okay um okay um I mean well um okay have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at at at at at you know I mean you know you know I mean uh okay okay okay at at at at at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
