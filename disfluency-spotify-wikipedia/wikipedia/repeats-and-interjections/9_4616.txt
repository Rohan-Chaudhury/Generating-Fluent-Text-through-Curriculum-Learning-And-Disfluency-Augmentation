This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed on a surface - well um uh okay um well well uh well the STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM image may appear um uh um well so you know you know so you know to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
