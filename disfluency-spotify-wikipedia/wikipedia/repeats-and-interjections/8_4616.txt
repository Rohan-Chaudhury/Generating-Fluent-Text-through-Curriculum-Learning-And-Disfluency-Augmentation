This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed on a surface - I mean so okay um so uh um so the STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM image may appear to have okay so uh so you know you know like so either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
