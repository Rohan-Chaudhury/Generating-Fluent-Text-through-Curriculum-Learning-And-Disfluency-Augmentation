This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is like well you know okay okay so uh uh adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed on so like uh okay so you know um well a surface - the STM image may may may may like okay I mean I mean so well uh uh may may may may may appear to have either INCREASED well well uh um so okay well I mean or DECREASED height at at at at at at at um like uh okay well um you know um at at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
