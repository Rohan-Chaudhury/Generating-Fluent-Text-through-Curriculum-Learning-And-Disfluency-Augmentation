The film's music score was composed by Cyril J okay so okay so well um. Mockridge; Mockridge; Mockridge; Mockridge; Mockridge; Mockridge; Mockridge; but in scenes like so uh so I mean so involving Hallie's relationships with Doniphon and Stoddard, Ford reprised like well you know so okay um Alfred Newman's 'Ann Rutledge Theme', from 'Young Mr. Lincoln'.
