The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure measure measure uh like like measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors I mean so okay sensors sensors sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
