Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler like well so um well you know um you know so cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by I mean okay um uh um uh well like okay making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
