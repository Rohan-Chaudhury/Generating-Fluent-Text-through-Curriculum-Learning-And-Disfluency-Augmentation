Hammershøi's work has an aloof austerity ( very different than Ilsted's scenes of common you know okay uh okay like so well you know so uh life life life life life life life life life life life ), and though sometimes Hammershøi's colorful early pictures are reminiscent of Tissot, his work is quintessentially Danish.
