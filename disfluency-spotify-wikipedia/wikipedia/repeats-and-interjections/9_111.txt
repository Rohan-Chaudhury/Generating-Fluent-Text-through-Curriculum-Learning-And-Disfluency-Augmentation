A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead um um well well well uh well I mean okay of of of of of of of of of of embedded uh okay you know like I mean so I mean you know like shortwave troughs, which are of smft within the troposphere like you know um um okay okay um you know so troposphere troposphere troposphere troposphere troposphere troposphere troposphere troposphere troposphere below, okay I mean so well so uh you know so okay which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.
