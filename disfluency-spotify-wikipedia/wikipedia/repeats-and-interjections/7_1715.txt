However, it can be difficult to estimate 'K' i i i I mean so like uh I mean okay um i i i i i and 'K' i' um uh um you know I mean uh you know accurately from such plots, so it it it uh so I mean okay so well I mean it it it it it um I mean so okay uh you know well is advisable to estimate these constants using more reliable nonlinear regression methods, as described above.
