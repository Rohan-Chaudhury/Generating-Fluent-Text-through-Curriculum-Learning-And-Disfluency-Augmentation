The Fox Chase - Newtown Rapid Transit Line ended operations with little fanfare, I mean I mean like okay fanfare, fanfare, fanfare, fanfare, as SEPTA management turned their attention to the electrified commuter lines like I mean you know um they began operating on January 1, 1983 (14 days before the end of Fox Chase - Newtown service).
