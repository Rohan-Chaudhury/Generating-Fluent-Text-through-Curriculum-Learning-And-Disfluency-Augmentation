The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to um okay I mean um so measure vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the okay okay um uh so sense that these sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
