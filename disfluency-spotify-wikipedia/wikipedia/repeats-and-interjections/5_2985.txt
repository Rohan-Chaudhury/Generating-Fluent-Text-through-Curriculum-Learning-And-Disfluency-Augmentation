Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, well I mean you know um I mean it was a heavily - - - - - - like okay I mean uh I mean traveled highway before Interstate 57, which lies very close close close close like so so so okay close close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed the entire um okay I mean um um route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
