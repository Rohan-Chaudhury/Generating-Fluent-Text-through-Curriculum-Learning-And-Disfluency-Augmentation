The first post-war model was the 1948 Mark V available with either 2. 5 5 so um well like so well 5 5 5 5 5 - or 3. 5 - litre engines, and it had okay I mean I mean so uh well a more streamlined appearance than pre-war models, but more important was the change to independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes.
