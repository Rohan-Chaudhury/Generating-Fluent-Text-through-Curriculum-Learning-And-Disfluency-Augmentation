Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for for um well um okay like I mean for for for for for the nonlinear element, well um okay um you know like but a simpler traditional solution is to use use like like so I mean okay I mean use use use use use a thermistor or an uh like well um okay so ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
