The first, on 1st violins and violas, is like the winds of a graveyard; well like like uh you know graveyard; graveyard; graveyard; graveyard; graveyard; the second, played by oboes, is slower and more like well um I mean okay melancholic; the third theme is played by the cor anglais accompanied by a lugubrious marching rhythm.
