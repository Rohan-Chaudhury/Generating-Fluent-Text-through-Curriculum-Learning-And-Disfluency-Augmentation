Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used used I mean okay well used used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler so like um traditional solution is to to to to use a thermistor or like okay you know an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both both both both like um you know provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
