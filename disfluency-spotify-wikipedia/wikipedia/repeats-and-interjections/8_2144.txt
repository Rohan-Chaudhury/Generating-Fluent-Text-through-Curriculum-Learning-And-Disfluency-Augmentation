Instead of a banked oval track, a figure eight track was used where one okay okay well so you know you know so well one one one one one one one one side heavily banked, and included obstacles well um I mean so okay I mean so well such as the 'Wall of Death' (which was located on the heavily banked side) and the 'Jet Jump'.
