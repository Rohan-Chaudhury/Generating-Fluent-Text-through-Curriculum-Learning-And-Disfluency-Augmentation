Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric um well you know you know you know I mean thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by making I mean so uh so so like small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
