In this method, building blocks are protected by all okay you know okay I mean I mean um I mean like like um reactive functional functional functional functional functional functional functional uh I mean so uh like um well you know so I mean functional functional functional functional groups and two functional groups in I mean you know you know so well I mean I mean okay you know um which the reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction um you know I mean so uh well uh so well I mean reaction occurs between building blocks in the solution and on uh you know uh you know you know like like you know you know you know the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
