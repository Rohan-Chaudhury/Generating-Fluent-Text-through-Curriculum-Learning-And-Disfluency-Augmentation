Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for um you know I mean you know uh like so well so for for for for for for for for for like so so okay uh well um um well the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is to well uh so I mean like you know well I mean um use use use use use use use use use use a I mean I mean you know um uh um um like well thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both both you know you know okay I mean so like so so okay both both both both both both both both provide like okay like like you know well uh okay like a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
