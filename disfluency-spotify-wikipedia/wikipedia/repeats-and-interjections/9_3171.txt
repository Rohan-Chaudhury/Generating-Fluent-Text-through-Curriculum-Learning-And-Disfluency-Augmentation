Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but but but well uh so so okay like you know like well but but but but but but but a simpler traditional solution is to use a so um like okay so well like you know you know thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
