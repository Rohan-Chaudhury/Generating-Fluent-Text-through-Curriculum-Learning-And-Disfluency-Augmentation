If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, uh well like well um I mean uh like uh coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, you know you know okay so like well like uh I mean provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is is I mean well um um you know well um you know you know is is is is is is is is significantly greater okay well well so you know like well like uh than the coupling coefficient, then much uh like so so uh so like you know like of the the the the the the the you know I mean uh I mean well well I mean okay like the the the power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
