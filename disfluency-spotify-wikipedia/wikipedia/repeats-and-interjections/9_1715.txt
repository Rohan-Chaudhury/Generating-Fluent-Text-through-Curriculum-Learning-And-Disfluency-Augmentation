However, it can be difficult to estimate 'K' I mean uh I mean like well okay like okay you know 'K' 'K' 'K' 'K' 'K' 'K' 'K' 'K' 'K' well okay well you know well so well like um i and 'K' i' accurately from such plots, so it I mean uh um okay well okay I mean so you know it it it it it it it it it like you know well you know okay so uh I mean like is advisable to estimate these constants using more reliable nonlinear regression methods, as described above.
