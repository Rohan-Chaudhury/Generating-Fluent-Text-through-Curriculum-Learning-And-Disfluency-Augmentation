Photons from an ideal single photon source exhibit photon antibunching, you know so okay so okay uh okay antibunching, antibunching, antibunching, antibunching, antibunching, antibunching, antibunching, so that the um well uh uh well uh so time between two successive photons is never less than some minimum value.
