French reviews of the offensive, found that reserves had moved close to the front, front, front, you know you know uh okay uh um front, front, front, front, ready to exploit a breakthrough and had advanced on time, then I mean well so well so okay bunched up with the leading divisions, blocked the lines of communication and suffered many casualties while held up.
