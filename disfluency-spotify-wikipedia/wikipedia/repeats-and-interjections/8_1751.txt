If 1950 DA continues on its present orbit, it it um uh um so well like like like it it it it it it it may approach Earth on March so I mean like well uh um um uh 16, 2880, though the mean trajectory trajectory trajectory trajectory trajectory trajectory I mean um so um uh well okay I mean trajectory trajectory trajectory passes many millions of kilometers from Earth, so I mean like uh uh I mean okay um like 1950 DA does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth.
