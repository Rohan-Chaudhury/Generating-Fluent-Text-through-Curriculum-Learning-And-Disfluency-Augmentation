If 1950 DA continues on its present orbit, it may approach Earth on March well like like um like okay like you know uh 16, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, though the mean trajectory you know uh like you know you know you know so um uh passes many millions of kilometers from Earth, so 1950 DA does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth.
