This can be shown dramatically when a molecule like you know like well like uh you know is adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed on uh I mean you know okay so so you know a surface - the STM image may appear to have have so uh you know like I mean so okay have have have have have have either INCREASED or DECREASED like um like you know like so I mean height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
