The first post-war model was the 1948 Mark V available with either 2. 5 5 5 okay so I mean uh I mean I mean well okay 5 5 5 5 5 5 - or 3. 5 - litre engines, and it uh so so okay you know well well I mean had a more streamlined appearance than pre-war models, but more important was the change to independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes.
