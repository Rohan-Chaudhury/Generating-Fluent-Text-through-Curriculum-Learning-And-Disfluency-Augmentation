Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear nonlinear uh I mean okay well okay nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or um you know I mean I mean uh an ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
