Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used used uh I mean I mean uh um used used used used for the nonlinear element, but well like okay like okay a simpler traditional solution is to to to to to so well so I mean okay to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; um well okay okay uh bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
