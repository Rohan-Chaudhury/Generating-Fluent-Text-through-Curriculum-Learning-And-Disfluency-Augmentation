The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure measure okay I mean okay so uh I mean like measure measure measure measure measure measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in um like so uh okay so okay the sense that these sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
