The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on so you know you know like you know you know you know the railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar like so like well I mean like uh itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are okay I mean like like you know okay well are are are are are are are flawed in uh um uh like I mean um well the sense that these sensors would not be well um uh well uh like so be be be be be be be able to distinguished between okay I mean you know so well so okay vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
