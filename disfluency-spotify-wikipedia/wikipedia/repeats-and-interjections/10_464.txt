As well and NV centres and molecules, quantum dots I mean I mean I mean you know you know uh so um um well (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) (QDs) uh okay well okay I mean um well um you know I mean (QDs) can emit single photons and can be I mean uh uh you know um so um so well uh constructed from the same semiconductor materials as the light - confining structures.
