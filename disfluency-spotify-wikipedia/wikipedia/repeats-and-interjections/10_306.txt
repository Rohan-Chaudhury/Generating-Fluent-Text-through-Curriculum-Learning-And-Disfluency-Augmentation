Almost all the natural electrical sources are constant constant uh uh okay okay uh uh so I mean so you know constant constant constant constant constant constant constant you know I mean I mean you know um like okay okay I mean you know constant constant voltage sources (primary and secondary batteries); however, there well I mean like um um okay um like like uh are no no no no no no no no no no no you know okay um well so okay like so you know uh convenient, constant current sources in nature (excepting inductors, Van der Graaf generators and photodiodes).
