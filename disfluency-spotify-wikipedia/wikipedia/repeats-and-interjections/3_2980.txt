Option ARMs are popular because they are usually offered okay you know uh with with with with a very low initial interest rate you know um well ( a so - - - - called 'teaser rate' you know okay I mean ) and a low minimum minimum minimum minimum payment, so so I mean which permits borrowers to qualify for a much larger loan than would otherwise be possible.
