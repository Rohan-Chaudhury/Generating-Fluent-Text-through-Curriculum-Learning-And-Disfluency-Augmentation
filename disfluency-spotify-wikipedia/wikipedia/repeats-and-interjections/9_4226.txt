The nitride ion (N 3 −) is isoelectronic isoelectronic I mean so like so well uh so um so isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic isoelectronic with the oxide anion, uh um so uh I mean I mean you know you know I mean O 2 −, and the the the the the well so okay uh well uh I mean so well the the the the the fluoride anion, F − and so I mean you know like like uh you know okay like has an ionic radius estimated to be 140 pm.
