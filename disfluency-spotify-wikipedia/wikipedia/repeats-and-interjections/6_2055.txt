In some cultures, especially in Africa, the letters RSVP, instead of standing for regrets' like like you know uh so well répondez répondez répondez répondez répondez répondez répondez s'il vous plaît', are there to reassure the you know well you know well so okay invitee that there would be plenty of food and the event would not be a 'dry one'.
