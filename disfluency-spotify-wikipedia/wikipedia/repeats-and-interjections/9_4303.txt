The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the okay so um you know you know uh so well I mean the the the the the the the the the okay okay um well okay so uh you know uh railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel I mean well so so uh you know uh I mean I mean impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact so like well I mean um um I mean uh okay conditions are flawed in the sense that these these these these uh well so you know um you know well um uh these these these these these these sensors would not I mean okay like you know um well like uh well be able to distinguished between between between between well uh I mean I mean so well like like so between between between between between between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
