The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations like like well uh um um well okay um and and and and and and and and and and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in well like so well I mean so like uh uh the sense that these sensors would not not not not not not not not not so okay um well I mean you know like um I mean not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
