A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead well like well I mean um so I mean like I mean uh of embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded embedded okay so you know okay well okay like so you know um embedded embedded shortwave troughs, which are of smft within the like I mean uh um um like uh so I mean I mean the the the the the the the the the well like um you know I mean I mean you know like you know like the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.
