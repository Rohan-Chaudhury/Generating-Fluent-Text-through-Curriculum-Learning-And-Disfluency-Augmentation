The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure I mean so um okay so I mean vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are well okay so I mean I mean uh flawed in the sense that that that that that that that these sensors would I mean okay um um so okay not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
