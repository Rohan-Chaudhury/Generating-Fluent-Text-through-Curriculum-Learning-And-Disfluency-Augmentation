The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the well okay okay well okay well railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar railcar itself, to well um okay okay um so measure vibrations and possible wheel impact impact impact impact um um okay okay so you know impact impact impact conditions are flawed in the sense um you know um um well well that these sensors would would would would would would would well you know okay I mean um um not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
