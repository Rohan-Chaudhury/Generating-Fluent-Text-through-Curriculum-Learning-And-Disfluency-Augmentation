Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric I mean so I mean well I mean so you know I mean cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by like well you know so I mean so uh okay making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
