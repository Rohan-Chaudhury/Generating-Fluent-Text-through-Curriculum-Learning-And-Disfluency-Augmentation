Some cars were fitted with vane - type superchargers, as the three main bearing engine so okay um like was was was was was liable to crankshaft failure if revved beyond 6, 500 rpm; so I mean so like superchargers allowed a TR4 to produce much more horse - power and torque at relatively modest revolutions.
