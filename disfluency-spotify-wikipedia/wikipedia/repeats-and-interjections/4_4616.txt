This can be shown dramatically when a molecule like okay um so is adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed on a surface okay you know okay uh - the STM image may appear to to to uh uh so uh to to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at like so I mean okay that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
