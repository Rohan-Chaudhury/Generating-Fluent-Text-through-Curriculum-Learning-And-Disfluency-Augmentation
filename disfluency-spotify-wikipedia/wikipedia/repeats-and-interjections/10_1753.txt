If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, provided um you know so you know well like I mean um I mean like provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided uh um I mean okay well like okay um um like the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly significantly okay I mean like so I mean well you know well um so significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly like well like well so okay well so like like significantly greater than the coupling coefficient, then much of um okay you know you know okay you know you know so I mean um the power power power power power power power you know so well I mean so so okay well okay so power power power power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
