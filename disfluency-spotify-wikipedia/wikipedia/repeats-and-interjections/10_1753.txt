If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, provided the Q of the the the so um I mean so I mean okay well I mean so well the the the the the the the the transmitting circuit is significantly greater than the I mean I mean like like uh you know uh so you know um coupling coefficient, then much of the power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
