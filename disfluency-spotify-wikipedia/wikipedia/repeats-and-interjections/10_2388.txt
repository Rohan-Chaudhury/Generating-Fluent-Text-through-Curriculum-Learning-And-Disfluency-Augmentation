John von Neumann studied the properties of the group well well well like I mean you know like I mean you know like group group group group group group group group group group so like you know you know you know okay well I mean okay you know of equivalences that make a paradoxical decomposition possible, identifying you know um so you know you know like like I mean well so identifying identifying identifying identifying identifying identifying identifying identifying identifying um um so okay um so like um so so identifying the class of amenable groups, for which no paradoxical decompositions exist.
