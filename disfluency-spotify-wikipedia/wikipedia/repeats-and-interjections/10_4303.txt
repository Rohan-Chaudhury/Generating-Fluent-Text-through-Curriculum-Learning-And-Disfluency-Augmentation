The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to to so you know like so I mean I mean um so so I mean to to to to to to to to to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact uh I mean well you know like well uh you know so um conditions are flawed in the sense that these these these these these these these these I mean um okay um okay you know like like well I mean these these these sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
