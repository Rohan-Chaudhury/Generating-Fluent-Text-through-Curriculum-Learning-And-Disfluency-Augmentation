Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes okay okay well you know uh you know well you know okay I mean sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes used for the okay uh well like so I mean um you know I mean you know nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution solution solution solution like you know well well I mean uh I mean uh you know uh solution solution solution solution solution solution solution is to use like like you know I mean uh okay uh you know so I mean a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent incandescent incandescent incandescent incandescent so okay so so um well okay okay so I mean incandescent incandescent incandescent incandescent incandescent incandescent light bulb; um well well like you know uh okay I mean I mean okay both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
