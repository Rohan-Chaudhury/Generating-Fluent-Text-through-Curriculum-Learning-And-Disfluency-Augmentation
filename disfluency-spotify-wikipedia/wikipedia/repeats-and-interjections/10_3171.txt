Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, I mean okay like I mean you know okay uh you know so um but a a a a a a a a a a a okay I mean I mean okay uh okay um so okay well simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
