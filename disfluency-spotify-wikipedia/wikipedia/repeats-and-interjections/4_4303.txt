The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on on uh well um you know on on on the railcar itself, to measure like um I mean like vibrations and possible wheel impact impact impact so uh I mean you know impact impact conditions are flawed in the sense that so um so okay these sensors sensors sensors sensors sensors would not be well uh like well able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
