The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations well um okay uh vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense so well um um that these sensors would would would would would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
