Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is is is is like um okay mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize stabilize stabilize stabilize the temperature, and you know okay well by making small small small small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
