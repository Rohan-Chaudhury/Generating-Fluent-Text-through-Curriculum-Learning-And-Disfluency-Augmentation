The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of neural neural neural neural neural neural neural neural neural neural ensembles in uh like um okay okay like well uh like the cerebral cortex, comprising large large large large large large large large large large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
