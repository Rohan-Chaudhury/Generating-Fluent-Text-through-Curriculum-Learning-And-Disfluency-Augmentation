The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and and and and and and and and and and and the synchronous uh so uh uh well so so so so so so so so so so so so like so I mean action of neural ensembles in the the the the the the the the the the the cerebral cortex, comprising you know okay well you know uh I I I I I I I I I I I mean you know so you know like large numbers of of of of of of of of of of of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
