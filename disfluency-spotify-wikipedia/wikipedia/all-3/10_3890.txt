The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh like I mean uh you know okay uh okay okay neural ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles ensembles in the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
