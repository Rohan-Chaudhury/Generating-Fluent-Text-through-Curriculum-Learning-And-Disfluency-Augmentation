If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided okay um so I mean well um you you you you you you you you you you know you know I mean the Q of the transmitting transmitting transmitting transmitting transmitting transmitting transmitting transmitting transmitting transmitting circuit is significantly greater than you know um I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean okay um so okay um um the coupling coefficient, then then then then then then then then then then much of the power can be you know uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh I mean um okay uh you know like like like like like like like like like like so absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
