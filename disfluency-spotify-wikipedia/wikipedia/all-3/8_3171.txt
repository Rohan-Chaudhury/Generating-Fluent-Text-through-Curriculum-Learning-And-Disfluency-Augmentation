Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but I I I I I I I I I mean like um um okay I mean like uh a simpler traditional solution is to to to to to to to to to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent uh uh okay I mean I mean so so so so so so so so so uh uh light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
