This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed well like so uh on a surface - the STM image image image image image may appear I mean I mean okay so to to to to to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
