Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip chip chip chip chip chip chip is well well uh I mean um you know mounted mounted mounted mounted mounted mounted mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, so so so so so so so well I mean so well well and by making small small small small small small small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
