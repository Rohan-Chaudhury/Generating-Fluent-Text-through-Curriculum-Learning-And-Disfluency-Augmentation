In this method, building blocks are protected by all all all all all all all reactive I mean uh you know uh well um functional functional functional functional functional functional functional groups and two functional groups in which the you know so so so so so so so uh so uh you know reaction occurs between building building building building building building building blocks in the solution and okay like I I I I I I I mean you know okay uh on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
