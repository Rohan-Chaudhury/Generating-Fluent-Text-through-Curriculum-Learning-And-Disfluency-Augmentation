Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes so so so so so so so so so so so so you know um okay um so so so I I I I I I I I I I I mean used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional okay uh um like I mean I mean okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay uh uh okay solution is to use a thermistor or or or or or or or or or or or an ordinary incandescent like you know so like I mean you you you you you you you you you you you know so well um I mean light bulb; both provide a resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
