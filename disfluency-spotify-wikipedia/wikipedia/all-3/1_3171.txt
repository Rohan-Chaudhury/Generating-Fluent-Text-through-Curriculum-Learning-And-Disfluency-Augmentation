Resistor - resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear nonlinear element, but a simpler uh traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
