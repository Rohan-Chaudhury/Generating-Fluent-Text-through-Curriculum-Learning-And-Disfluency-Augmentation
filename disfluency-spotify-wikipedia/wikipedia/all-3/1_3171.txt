Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes sometimes well used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution solution uh is to use a thermistor or an ordinary ordinary well incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
