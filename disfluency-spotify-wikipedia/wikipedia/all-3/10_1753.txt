If some if some if some if some if some if some some some some some some some some some some some if some if some if some if some some some some some some some some some some some if some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, like you know okay well you know like you know know know know know know know know know know know I mean um um provided the Q of of of of of of of of of of of the transmitting circuit is significantly greater I mean like you you you you you you you you you you you know well you know well well well like like like like like like like like like like like okay than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power power power power power power power power power power power can so so so uh like so you know know know know know know know know know know know so so so be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
