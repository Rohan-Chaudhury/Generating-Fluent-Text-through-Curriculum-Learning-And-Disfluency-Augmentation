The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations uh well I mean you know um so um well well um and possible wheel wheel wheel wheel wheel wheel wheel wheel wheel wheel wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors would well I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean like well so uh like I mean I mean so not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
