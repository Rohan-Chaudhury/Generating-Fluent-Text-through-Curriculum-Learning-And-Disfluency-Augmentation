The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded you you you you you you you you you you you know I mean so um okay uh uh you you you you you you you you you you you know I mean like on the railcar itself, to to to to to to to to to to to measure vibrations and possible I mean okay I mean I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean uh you know you know you know know know know know know know know know know know so so wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense sense sense sense sense sense sense sense sense sense sense that these you know well okay so I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean so um you know like okay sensors would not not not not not not not not not not not be able to distinguished so I mean uh so so so so so so so so so so so so like okay so like well between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
