The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on on on on the well like well railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible possible possible possible wheel impact conditions I mean okay I mean are are are are flawed in the sense that these sensors sensors sensors sensors would um um well not be able to distinguished between between between between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
