The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations vibrations um I mean um like you know um well and possible wheel impact conditions are are are are are are are are flawed in the sense that these sensors would not well so I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean um um uh like be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
