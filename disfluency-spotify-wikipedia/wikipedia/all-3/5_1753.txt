If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, provided I mean uh okay um uh the the the the the the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly greater uh uh uh uh uh uh uh so I mean like than the coupling coefficient, coefficient, coefficient, coefficient, coefficient, coefficient, then much of the power can I mean well well well well well well you know okay uh be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
