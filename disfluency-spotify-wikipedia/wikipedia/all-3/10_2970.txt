One particular defender of the idea of species species species species species species species species species species species selection so um so um you know I mean uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh I mean like like is S. J. Gould Gould Gould Gould Gould Gould Gould Gould Gould Gould Gould who has proposed the view you know okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay like I mean uh okay uh like um um um um um um um um um um um I mean that there exist macroevolutionary processes which shape evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution beyond the I mean okay okay um so uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay you know you know level level level level level level level level level level level of species and are not driven by the microevolutionary mechanisms already characterized by evolutionary biologists.
