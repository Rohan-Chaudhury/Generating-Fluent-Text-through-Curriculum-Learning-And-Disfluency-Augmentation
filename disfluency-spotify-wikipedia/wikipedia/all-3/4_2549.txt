Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler um I mean I mean like to stabilize the temperature, and by making small small small small small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
