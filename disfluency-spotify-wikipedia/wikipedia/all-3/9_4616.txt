This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed um um um um um um um um um um uh like uh I mean you know uh um well on on on on on on on on on on a surface - the STM image image image image image image image image image image may appear to okay so you know like so uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay uh have either INCREASED or DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED height at um well so um uh well I I I I I I I I I I mean like okay that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
