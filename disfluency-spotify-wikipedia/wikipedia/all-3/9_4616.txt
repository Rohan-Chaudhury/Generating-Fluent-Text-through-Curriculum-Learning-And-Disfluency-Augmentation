This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed on a surface - well well well well well well well well well well okay uh well like well so uh so the STM image may appear to have have have have have have have have have have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
