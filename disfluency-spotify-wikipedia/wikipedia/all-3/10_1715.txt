However, it can be difficult to estimate 'K' i and and and and and and and and and and and you know um so okay well um you know well well well well well well well well well well well okay um 'K' i' accurately from such plots, so so so so so so so so so so so it is advisable you know like like well um um um um um um um um um um um so uh um like um to estimate these constants using more reliable nonlinear regression methods, as described above.
