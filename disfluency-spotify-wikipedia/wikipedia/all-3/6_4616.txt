This can this can this can this can this can can can can can can can this can this can be shown dramatically when a molecule I I I I I I I mean like um um so well is adsorbed on a a a a a a a surface - the STM image may well so um so so so so so so so uh um appear to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height height height height height height height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
