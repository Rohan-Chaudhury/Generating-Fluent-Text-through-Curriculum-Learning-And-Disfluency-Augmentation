Resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor - resistor - resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, element, element, element, element, element, element, element, element, element, but you know I mean okay uh you know you know um okay you you you you you you you you you you know a simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
