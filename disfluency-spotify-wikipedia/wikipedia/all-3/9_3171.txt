Resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor - resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for for for for for for for for for for the um like well like okay you know um I I I I I I I I I I mean um nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is is is is is is is is is is to use a well so like uh well like you you you you you you you you you you know okay well thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both both both both both both both both both both provide uh like uh you know um okay uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
