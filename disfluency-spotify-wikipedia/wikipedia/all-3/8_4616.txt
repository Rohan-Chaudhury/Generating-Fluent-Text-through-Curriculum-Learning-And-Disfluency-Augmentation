This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is you you you you you you you you you know okay well like um uh like uh adsorbed on on on on on on on on on a surface - the STM image may so well well well well well well well well well uh well I mean uh uh you know appear appear appear appear appear appear appear appear appear to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that that that that that that that that that you know so so okay so like I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean um feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
