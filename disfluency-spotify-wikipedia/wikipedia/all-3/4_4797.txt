Unlike most other neurotransmitters that only transmit information from a presynaptic to a postsynaptic postsynaptic postsynaptic postsynaptic postsynaptic neuron, I mean uh well I mean the small nitric oxide molecule can diffuse all all all all all over and can thereby act on several nearby neurons, even on those not connected by a synapse.
