Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but but but but but but but I mean like you know okay uh okay a simpler traditional solution is to use use use use use use use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
