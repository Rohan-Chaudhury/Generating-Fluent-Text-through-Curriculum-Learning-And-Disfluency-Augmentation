Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used well well well well well well well um I mean so I mean I mean for for for for for for for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution well well well well well well well well well you know well um is to use a a a a a a a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent okay um uh I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean I mean you know light bulb; both provide provide provide provide provide provide provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
