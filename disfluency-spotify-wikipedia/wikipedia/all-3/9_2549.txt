Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler so um okay well you know like I mean I mean like to stabilize the temperature, temperature, temperature, temperature, temperature, temperature, temperature, temperature, temperature, temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
