LTS result in the neuron reaching the threshold for an action potential, and so I I I I I I I I I mean like uh I mean uh you know you know I mean the spike spike spike spike spike spike spike spike spike is typically crowned by a burst of two to seven action potentials, which is known as a low - threshold burst.
