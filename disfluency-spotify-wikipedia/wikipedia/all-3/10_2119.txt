In this method, building blocks are protected by uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay you know I mean uh um I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean okay so I mean all reactive functional groups and two two two two two two two two two two two functional groups in which the like okay well well well well well well well well well well well I mean um okay uh okay well I mean reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction reaction occurs between building blocks in the solution and on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
