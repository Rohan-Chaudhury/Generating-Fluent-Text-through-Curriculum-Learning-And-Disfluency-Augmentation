This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed okay you know on a surface - the STM STM STM image may appear okay you know to have either INCREASED INCREASED INCREASED or DECREASED height at that okay well feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
