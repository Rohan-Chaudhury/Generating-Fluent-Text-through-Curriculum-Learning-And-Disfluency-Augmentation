The proof of the upward part of the the the the the the the the the the the theorem like like you know I mean well like well so so so so so so so so so so so well um also shows that a theory with arbitrarily large large large large large large large large large large large finite models um um so uh I mean well well well well well well well well well well well I mean like so well must have an infinite infinite infinite infinite infinite infinite infinite infinite infinite infinite infinite model; sometimes this is considered to be part of the theorem.
