If 1950 if 1950 if 1950 if 1950 if 1950 1950 1950 1950 1950 DA continues on its present orbit, it may like like like like like uh okay um approach Earth on March 16, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, though the mean okay you know okay I mean trajectory passes passes passes passes passes many millions of kilometers from Earth, so 1950 DA does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth.
