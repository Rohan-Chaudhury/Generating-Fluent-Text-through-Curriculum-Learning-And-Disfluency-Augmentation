Resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, so I I I I I I I I mean well I mean like I mean I mean but a simpler traditional solution is to to to to to to to to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light so um I mean okay like okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay uh bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
