Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes used well um okay um you know uh okay for for for for for for for for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution so so so so so so so so like uh so okay like I mean is to use a thermistor thermistor thermistor thermistor thermistor thermistor thermistor thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; uh well uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay like um I mean both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
