This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is is is is is is okay I mean so I mean so adsorbed on on on on on on a surface - the STM image okay uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay okay may appear to have either INCREASED or DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED DECREASED well um uh well like height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
