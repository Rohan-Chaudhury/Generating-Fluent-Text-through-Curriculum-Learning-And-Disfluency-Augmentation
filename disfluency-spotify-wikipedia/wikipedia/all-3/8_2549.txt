Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip well well well well well well well well well well so like um uh you know like is mounted on a a a a a a a a a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and and and and and and and and and uh um uh okay I mean like so so by by by by by by by by by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
