A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave troughs, which I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean like okay well um I mean uh I mean okay uh are of smft smft smft smft smft smft smft smft smft smft smft within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.
