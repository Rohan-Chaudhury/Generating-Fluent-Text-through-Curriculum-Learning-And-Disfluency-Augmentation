If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, provided the Q of the the the the the the the the transmitting so I mean like you know like uh uh circuit is significantly greater than than than than than than than than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
