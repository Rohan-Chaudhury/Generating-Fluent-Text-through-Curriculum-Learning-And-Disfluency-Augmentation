If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, I I I I I I I I mean well you know I mean well well okay provided provided provided provided provided provided provided provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly greater greater greater greater greater greater greater greater well uh well you know okay uh uh than than than than than than than than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power well well well well well well well well I mean so okay um you know so can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
