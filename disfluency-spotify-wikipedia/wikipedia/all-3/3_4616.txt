This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed adsorbed um okay um on a surface - the STM STM STM STM image may appear well well uh to have either INCREASED or or or or DECREASED height at that so well um feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
