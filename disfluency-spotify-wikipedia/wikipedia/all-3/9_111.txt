A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs occurs occurs occurs occurs occurs occurs occurs occurs occurs ahead well uh like um I mean I mean so so so so so so so so so so um um of embedded shortwave troughs, which are of smft smft smft smft smft smft smft smft smft smft within the you know like uh I mean so so I I I I I I I I I I mean I mean you know troposphere below, which lowers surface surface surface surface surface surface surface surface surface surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.
