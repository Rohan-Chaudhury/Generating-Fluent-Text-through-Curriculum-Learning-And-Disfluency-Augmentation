Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for for for so uh the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution solution solution is uh you know to use a thermistor or or or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; you know okay both provide provide provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
