This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is is is is is is is is is is is adsorbed on okay so you know um well so you you you you you you you you you you you know I mean um I mean a surface - the STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM STM image may appear to I mean uh I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean like uh you know um um I mean I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that that that that that that that that that that that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
