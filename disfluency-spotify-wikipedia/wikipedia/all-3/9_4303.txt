The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and and and and and and and and and and possible uh well so well so I mean um well you know wheel impact conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors would not I mean so you know like well well well well well well well well well well okay well well uh be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
