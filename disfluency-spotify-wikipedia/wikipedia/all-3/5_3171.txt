Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used I mean like like like like like like I mean so I mean for the nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is I mean mean mean mean mean mean um okay well I mean to use a thermistor or or or or or or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; um so um um um um um um um so both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
