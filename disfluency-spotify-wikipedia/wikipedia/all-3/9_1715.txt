However, it can be difficult to estimate 'K' i and and and and and and and and and and well like I mean I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean so you know like um uh 'K' i' i' i' i' i' i' i' i' i' i' accurately from such plots, so it is I mean uh okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay well like okay okay well advisable to estimate estimate estimate estimate estimate estimate estimate estimate estimate estimate these constants using more reliable nonlinear regression methods, as described above.
