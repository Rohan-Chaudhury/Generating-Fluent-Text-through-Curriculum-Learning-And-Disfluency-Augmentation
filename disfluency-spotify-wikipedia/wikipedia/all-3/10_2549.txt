Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler cooler to um uh um um uh uh like okay you know like stabilize the the the the the the the the the the the temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
