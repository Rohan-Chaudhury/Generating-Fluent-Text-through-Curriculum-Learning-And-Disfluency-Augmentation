Almost all the natural electrical sources are constant voltage voltage voltage voltage voltage voltage voltage voltage voltage voltage sources so uh I mean um you you you you you you you you you you know like well so well (primary and secondary batteries); however, however, however, however, however, however, however, however, however, however, there are no convenient, constant um um you know okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay you know well so like like current sources in nature (excepting inductors, Van der Graaf generators and photodiodes).
