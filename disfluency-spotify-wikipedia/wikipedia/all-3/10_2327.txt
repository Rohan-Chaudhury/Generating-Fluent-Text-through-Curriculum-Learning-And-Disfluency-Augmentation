Its worst its worst its worst its worst its worst its worst its worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst its worst its worst its worst its worst - case time complexity is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, but on average its performance is or um well like so um so so like like like like like like like like like like like okay I mean even depending on the random distribution on automata chosen to model the algorithm's average - case behavior.
