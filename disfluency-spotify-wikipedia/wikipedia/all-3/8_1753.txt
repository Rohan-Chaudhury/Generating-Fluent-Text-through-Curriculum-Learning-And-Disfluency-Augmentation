If some if some if some if some if some if some some some some some some some some some if some if some if some energy is placed placed placed placed placed placed placed placed placed in the 'sender' coil, you know you know know know know know know know know know um um like well well I mean provided the the the the the the the the the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly greater uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay okay you know um so um like than the the the the the the the the the coupling coefficient, then much of the power can be be be be be be be be be well well um uh okay so like okay absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
