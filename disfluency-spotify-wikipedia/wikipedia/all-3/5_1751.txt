If 1950 if 1950 if 1950 if 1950 if 1950 if 1950 DA continues on its its its its its its present orbit, it may approach Earth on March well like um like well 16, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, 2880, though the mean trajectory passes many millions of kilometers from Earth, so 1950 DA does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth.
