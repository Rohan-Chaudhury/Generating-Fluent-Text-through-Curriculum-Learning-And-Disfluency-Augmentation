Rapid growth of industry drastically changed the city itself - by the early 1960s 1960s 1960s 1960s the population okay I mean uh exceeded the 100, 000 mark (three times times times times bigger than the pre-World War II population), and okay so you know by 1970 it became the largest city in the Vologda Oblast ahead of Vologda itself.
