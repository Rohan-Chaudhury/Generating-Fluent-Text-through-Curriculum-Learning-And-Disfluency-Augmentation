Its worst its worst its worst its worst its worst its worst its worst its its its its its its its its worst - case time complexity is, but on average its performance is or so like like like like like like like like well you know you know I mean I mean even depending on the random distribution on automata chosen to model the algorithm's average - case behavior.
