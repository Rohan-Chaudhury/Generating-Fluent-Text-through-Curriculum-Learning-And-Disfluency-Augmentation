The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of neural neural neural neural neural neural neural neural neural ensembles okay um well like you know um okay well in the cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations, which can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG).
