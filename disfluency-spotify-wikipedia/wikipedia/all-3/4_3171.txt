Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used used used used used for I mean well well I mean the nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is I mean mean mean mean mean well so okay to use a thermistor or or or or or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; I mean um you know know know know know uh both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
