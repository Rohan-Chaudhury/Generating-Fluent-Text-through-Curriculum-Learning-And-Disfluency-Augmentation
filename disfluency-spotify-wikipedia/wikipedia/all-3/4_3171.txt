Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear so you you you you you know like I mean element, but a simpler traditional solution is to use a a a a a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
