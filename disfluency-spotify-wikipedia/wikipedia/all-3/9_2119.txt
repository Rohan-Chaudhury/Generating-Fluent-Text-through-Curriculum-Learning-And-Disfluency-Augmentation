In this in this in this in this in this in this in in in in in in in in in in this in this in this in this method, building blocks are protected by all reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive functional groups and two functional so uh I mean uh okay um okay so so so so so so so so so so you know groups in which the reaction occurs between building blocks in the solution and on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
