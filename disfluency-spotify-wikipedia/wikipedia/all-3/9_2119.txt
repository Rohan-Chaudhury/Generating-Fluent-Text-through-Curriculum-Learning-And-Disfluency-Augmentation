In this in this in this in this in in in in in in in in in in this in this in this in this in this in in in in in in in in in in this method, building blocks are protected by all reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive functional uh well um um um um um um um um um um um um um um okay like groups and two functional groups in in in in in in in in in in which the reaction occurs between uh okay like I mean so so so so so so so so so so you know like well like building blocks in the solution and and and and and and and and and and on the bead can be controlled by the order of deprotection.
