Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used so um uh well uh um so for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is so okay so okay I mean you know you know to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light okay um um well so like so bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
