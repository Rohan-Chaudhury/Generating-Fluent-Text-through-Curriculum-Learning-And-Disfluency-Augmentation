Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for okay okay you know you know well you know the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is to like I mean okay well well um use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; like so you know um I mean well both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
