Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, I mean so okay like uh you know but a simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent well I mean um um well okay light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
