The first post-war model was the 1948 Mark V available with um uh okay uh I mean either 2. 5 - or 3. 5 - litre engines, um I mean so um well and it had a more streamlined appearance than uh well okay so um pre-war models, but more important was the change to independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes.
