Despite the fact that it is sometimes called the otaheite cashew, 'Syzygium malaccense' is like you know um like you know um not related to cashew -- an important distinction because cashew nuts (but not cashew well so uh I mean okay I mean fruits) may trigger allergic reactions while rose apple fruit has not been observed to do so.
