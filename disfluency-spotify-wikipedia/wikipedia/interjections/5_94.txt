A music video for their song 'The Big Picture' uh okay um you know well was made, but the only member of the band so uh I mean uh okay featured was Amos, since by then, unable to withstand pressure like you know you know like like from Atlantic Records she had jettisoned the entire band with the exception of Steve Caton.
