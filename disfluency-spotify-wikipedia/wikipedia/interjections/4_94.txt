A music video for their song 'The Big Picture' was like I mean well uh made, but the only member of the band you know well I mean uh featured was Amos, since by then, unable to withstand pressure from like okay uh uh Atlantic Records she had jettisoned the entire band with the exception of Steve Caton.
