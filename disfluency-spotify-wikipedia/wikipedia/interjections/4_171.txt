Actin is a globular protein (~ 43 kDa) which polymerizes like you know uh you know and forms into an ordered filament structure which has like you know I mean okay two protofilaments wrapping around each other, to form a so um um well single 'actin filament' ( previously referred to as 'microfilament' ).
