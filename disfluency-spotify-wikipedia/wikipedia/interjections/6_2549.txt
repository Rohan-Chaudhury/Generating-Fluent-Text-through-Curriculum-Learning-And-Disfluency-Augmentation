Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser well I mean you know well well so chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the I mean um so like so you know temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside uh well you know so uh so temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
