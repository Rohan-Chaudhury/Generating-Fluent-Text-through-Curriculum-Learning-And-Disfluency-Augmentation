If 1950 DA continues on its present orbit, it like you know okay well so you know I mean I mean may approach Earth on March 16, 2880, so um so well I mean like like um though the mean trajectory passes many millions of kilometers from so you know uh so like uh okay so Earth, so 1950 DA does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth.
