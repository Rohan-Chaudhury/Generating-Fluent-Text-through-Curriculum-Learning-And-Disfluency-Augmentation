The radar range was still low (27 km was um so you know you know I mean so you know like quite normal for a fighter - sized target) and the you know well you know uh you know so well so loss rate remained high, with peaks in 1973 and so um I mean uh you know I mean well okay 1975 (ten F - 104s of all versions lost).
