Various local media reports claim that the school management I mean well so had destroyed or atleast tried to hide the evidence I mean you know okay before the police arrived and they alleged that fellow students uh I mean um were asked to wash spilled blood and other evidence um so uh so that the fingerprint and other marks could not be identified.
