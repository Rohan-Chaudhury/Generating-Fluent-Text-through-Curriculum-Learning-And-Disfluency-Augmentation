Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes okay so okay you know well um I mean so used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is so um um um um I mean well I mean to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light well you know um like I mean well I mean okay bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
