Some cars were fitted with vane - type superchargers, as you know so so um the three main bearing engine was liable to crankshaft uh okay like like failure if revved beyond 6, 500 rpm; superchargers allowed a TR4 like you know so I mean to produce much more horse - power and torque at relatively modest revolutions.
