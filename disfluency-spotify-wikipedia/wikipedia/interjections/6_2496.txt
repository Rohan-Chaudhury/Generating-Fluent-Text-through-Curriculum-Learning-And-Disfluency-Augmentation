Largely due to the poor economic conditions of New like you know so I mean I mean like Haven in the 1970s and 1980s, 'The Record' sputtered along, foundered uh well like I mean I mean like and was revived numerous times during the 1970s um I mean you know uh okay well and 1980s, but in 1990, Michael Gerber revived 'The Record' for good.
