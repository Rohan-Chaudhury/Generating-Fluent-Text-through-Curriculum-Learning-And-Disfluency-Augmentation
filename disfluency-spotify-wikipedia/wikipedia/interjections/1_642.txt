Bruce was not elected to a second term in 1881 well and in 1890 the Democratic - dominated state legislature I mean passed a new constitution disfranchising most black voters, a situation I mean that persisted into the 1960s until after uh federal enforcement of constitutional rights under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
