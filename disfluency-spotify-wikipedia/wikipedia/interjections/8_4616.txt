This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed well I mean uh okay uh so I mean like on a surface - the STM image may appear okay so uh you know you know I mean I mean you know to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
