The couple only used parts of the ground floor and okay okay um sadly the rest of the house became little more uh like okay than a ruin - until in 1986 Cornelia Bayley well I mean so (the present owner) bought Plas Teg for £ 750, 000 you know like you know which included a grant of £ 250, 000 from CADW.
