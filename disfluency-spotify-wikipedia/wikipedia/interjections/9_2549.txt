Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is uh um okay uh um um so um you know mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by making well you know I mean uh so uh well okay well small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
