Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it okay so um okay okay was a heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, which I mean well you know okay I mean lies very close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed um you know so well like the entire route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
