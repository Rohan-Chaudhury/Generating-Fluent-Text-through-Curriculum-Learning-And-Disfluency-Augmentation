Actin is a globular protein (~ 43 kDa) which you know I mean so I mean well um so okay you know I mean polymerizes and forms into an ordered filament structure which has um I mean I mean well I mean I mean so well like well two protofilaments wrapping around each other, to form a single 'actin filament' ( previously referred to as 'microfilament' ).
