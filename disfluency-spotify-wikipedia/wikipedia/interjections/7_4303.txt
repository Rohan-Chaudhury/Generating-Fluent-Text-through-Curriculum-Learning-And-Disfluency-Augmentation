The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar like okay so well uh okay like itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are um okay like I mean well like like flawed in the sense that these sensors would I mean uh like well well like well not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating like well so you know like I mean you know from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
