The couple only used parts of the ground floor and sadly um so uh I mean uh well the rest of the house became little more than so so so I mean okay well a ruin - until in 1986 Cornelia Bayley (the well I mean okay so I mean like present owner) bought Plas Teg for £ 750, 000 which included a grant of £ 250, 000 from CADW.
