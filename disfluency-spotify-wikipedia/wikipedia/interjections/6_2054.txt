In season two, Waller often forces John Diggle to work for her on well well uh so I mean okay missions other A. R. G. U. S. Agents are unwilling to perform and like um well you know okay I mean tries to have Starling City destroyed during Slade Wilson's attack to contain the Mirakuru soldiers, only to be stopped by John and Lyla.
