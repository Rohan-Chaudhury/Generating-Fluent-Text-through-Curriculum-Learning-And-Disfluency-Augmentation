Konkani Plays, known as Tiatr, a form of okay uh okay I mean classic stage performance with live singing and acting, were okay so um so written and staged in Goa, since the time it evolved so I mean like like during the twenteeth century with pioneer tiatrists such as Jao Agostinho Fernandes (1871 -- 1941).
