Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was a okay uh you know so like uh heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, which lies I mean like well well well well very close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed the entire route like uh you know okay like well north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
