The film's music score was composed by Cyril J. Mockridge; but in you know I mean uh uh uh I mean uh okay like like scenes involving Hallie's relationships with Doniphon and Stoddard, Ford so um okay you know you know well so well uh you know reprised Alfred Newman's 'Ann Rutledge Theme', from 'Young Mr. Lincoln'.
