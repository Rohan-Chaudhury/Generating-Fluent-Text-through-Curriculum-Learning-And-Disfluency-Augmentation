Instead of a banked oval track, a figure eight track like you know uh well okay so you know I mean um was used where one side heavily banked, and included like I mean um okay okay well I mean so okay obstacles such as the 'Wall of Death' (which was located on the heavily banked side) and the 'Jet Jump'.
