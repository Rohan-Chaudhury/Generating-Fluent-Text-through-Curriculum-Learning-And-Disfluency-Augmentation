This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed on so I mean like I mean so so um I mean uh um a surface - the STM image may appear to so uh you know well like um so um like like have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
