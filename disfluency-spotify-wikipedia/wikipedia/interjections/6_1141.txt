French reviews of the offensive, found that reserves had moved like I mean so well okay well close to the front, ready to exploit a breakthrough and so you know so okay like so had advanced on time, then bunched up with you know okay um uh like so the leading divisions, blocked the lines of communication and suffered many casualties while held up.
