Flashlights used for extended periods every day may be more economically operated on well okay I mean so rechargeable (secondary) batteries. Fleshlights designed for rechargeable batteries may allow charging without removing the batteries; okay okay well like for example, a light kept in a vehicle may be trickle - charged and always ready when needed.
