Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip okay um okay I mean you know okay uh uh is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the well okay uh you know so okay you know I mean temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside so like so you know well um okay I mean temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
