Hammershøi's work has an aloof austerity ( very I mean so you know uh uh you know you know okay you know different than Ilsted's scenes of common life ), and okay uh uh well well um um you know I mean though sometimes Hammershøi's colorful early pictures are reminiscent of Tissot, his work is quintessentially Danish.
