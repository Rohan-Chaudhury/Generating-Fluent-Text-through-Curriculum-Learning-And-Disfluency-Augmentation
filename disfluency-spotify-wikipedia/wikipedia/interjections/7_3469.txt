Some of the problems with viewing consonant gradation like uh um so you know so I mean in Finnish as purely an issue of syllable okay well like like I mean so okay structure is that the language has undergone various phonetic changes uh okay I mean uh like like uh due to which not all weak grades occur in you know you know well okay um like you know closed syllables, and not all strong grades occur in open syllables.
