Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was a okay uh well okay well um uh heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, which lies very uh you know uh you know well okay I mean close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed the uh well so so okay um I mean entire route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
