A U. S. Navy A- 4 Skyhawk that was sent up shortly after the accident so okay like so you know you know okay uh I mean so to search for the wreckage encountered extreme turbulence in the accident area, and many other aircraft that passed near Mount Fuji that day also reported moderate to severe turbulence.
