The red - staining inocybe was first described by Axel Gudbrand okay okay you know Blytt in 1904 as 'Inocybe erubescens', though was widely known like I mean okay for many years as 'I. Patouillardii', named by Italian so so like Giacomo Bresadola in 1905 after the French botanist Narcisse Th√©ophile Patouillard.
