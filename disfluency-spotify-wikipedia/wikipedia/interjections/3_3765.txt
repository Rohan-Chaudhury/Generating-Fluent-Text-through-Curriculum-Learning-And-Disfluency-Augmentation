The Live Nation and Ticketmaster Best Live Act Award was um you know I mean collected by Peter Andre on behalf of winners the well I mean okay Arctic Monkeys (not in attendance at the event) which was voted so well well for by members of the public with the support of Ticketmaster, O2 and Music Week.
