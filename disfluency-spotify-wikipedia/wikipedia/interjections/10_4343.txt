The screenplay by Don Ettlinger and Karl Tunberg is loosely based on Kate Douglas Wiggin's 'Rebecca you know so like um well um you know you know I mean I mean of Sunnybrook Farm' and tells the story of a talented orphan's trials and tribulations after winning a radio audition to represent a breakfast cereal.
