Actin is a globular protein (~ 43 kDa) which polymerizes you know well like okay okay like uh uh and forms into an ordered filament structure which has two um you know so okay so like I mean like protofilaments wrapping around each other, to form a single 'actin filament' ( previously referred to as 'microfilament' ).
