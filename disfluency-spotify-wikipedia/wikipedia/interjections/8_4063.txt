The first documented use of the term is within a song featuring I mean I mean well um I mean like okay so producer and lyricist Rebel MC, in which a sample was okay okay so I mean uh you know you know uh taken from a much older dancehall tune containing the lyrics 'Rebel got this chant -' alla the junglists'.
