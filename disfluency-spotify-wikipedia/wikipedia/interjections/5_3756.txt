The Kintetsu Buffaloes were the first Japanese team to sign an American player uh so okay well well when they signed former major league pitcher Glenn Mickens and catcher Ron Bottler, who like so you know um you know had played in 1958 for minor league clubs St. Paul and Austin, for the 1959 season.
