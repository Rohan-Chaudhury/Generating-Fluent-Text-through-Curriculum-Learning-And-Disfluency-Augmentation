The singer's laconic banter and corny jokes are also okay um so um uh I mean so okay on full display, but the album is most remarkable for I mean well I mean uh okay um you know um the intimacy of the performance, with Van Zandt taking the stage um I mean okay I mean you know okay uh okay alone and accompanying himself on guitar as he did thousands of times during his career.
