It was announced at E3 2007 that Sucker Punch was working on a I mean you know like well PlayStation 3 title called 'inFamous', a sandbox game based on a futuristic world with you know you know uh so more photorealistic graphics, about a superhuman who must make moral choices to save or destroy Empire City.
