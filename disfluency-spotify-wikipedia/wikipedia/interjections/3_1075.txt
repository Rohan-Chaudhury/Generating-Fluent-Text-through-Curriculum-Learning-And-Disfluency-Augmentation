Flashlights used for extended periods every day may well uh uh be more economically operated on rechargeable (secondary) batteries. Fleshlights okay um so designed for rechargeable batteries may allow charging without removing the batteries; um okay okay for example, a light kept in a vehicle may be trickle - charged and always ready when needed.
