Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the okay so okay okay you know like so well uh well laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize so um you know well you know well okay so well like the temperature, and by making small adjustments to um I mean so okay like like you know like like I mean the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
