Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric I mean um I mean like you know like so like okay you know cooler to stabilize the temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
