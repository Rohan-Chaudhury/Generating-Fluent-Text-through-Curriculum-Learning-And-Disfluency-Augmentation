Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was a uh like like like like so so um so uh heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, which lies very okay uh like uh well uh um I mean uh like close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed the entire I mean so I mean okay uh uh um you know you know um route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
