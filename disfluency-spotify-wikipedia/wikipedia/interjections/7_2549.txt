Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is so so um okay okay like so mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, and you know like you know you know like I mean okay by making small adjustments to the inside I mean like well so so uh I mean temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
