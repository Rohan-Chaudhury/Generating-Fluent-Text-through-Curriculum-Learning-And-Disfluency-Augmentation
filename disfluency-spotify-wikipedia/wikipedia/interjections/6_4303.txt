The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on okay so like I mean well uh the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions you know like like uh um I mean are flawed in the sense that these sensors would not be able um well um well okay I mean to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
