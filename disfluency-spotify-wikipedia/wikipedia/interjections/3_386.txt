Another similar archway with similar architecture was built in you know you know you know Ta' Xbiex, also back then part of Sliema, by the um you know so same Testaferrata family but was demolished in 1989 and okay okay so the exact location it stood is unknown but was in the parameters of Brockdorff Street.
