If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, um okay so well I mean so so provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly you know well well so I mean uh you know greater than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power uh um uh I mean well okay uh can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
