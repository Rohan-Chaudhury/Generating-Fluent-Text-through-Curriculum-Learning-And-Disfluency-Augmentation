Burgoyne had gained the field of battle, like uh like like um but suffered nearly 600 casualties, mostly in Hamilton's well well uh I mean okay centre column, where the 62nd was reduced to like you know like well well the size of a single company and three quarters of the artillery men were killed or wounded.
