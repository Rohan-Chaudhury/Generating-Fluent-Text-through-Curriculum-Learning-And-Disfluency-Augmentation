Flashlights used for extended periods every day may be more economically operated on rechargeable (secondary) batteries you know okay I mean uh um uh like. Fleshlights designed for rechargeable batteries may allow charging without removing the batteries; for example, okay so I mean well I mean like well a light kept in a vehicle may be trickle - charged and always ready when needed.
