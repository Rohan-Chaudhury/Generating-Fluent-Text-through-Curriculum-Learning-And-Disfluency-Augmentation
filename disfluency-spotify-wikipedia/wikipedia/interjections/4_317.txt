Although Elliott was running for the UUP he was you know uh I mean well also being actively supported by the DUP, the TUV well you know okay I mean and UKIP. The Tory party also refused to run a candidate you know okay well well in Fermanagh South Tyrone despite running in 16 out of 18 constituencies.
