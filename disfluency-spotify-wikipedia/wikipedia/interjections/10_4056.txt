The first, on 1st violins and violas, you know I mean you know well um I mean so okay so uh is like the winds of a graveyard; the second, played by I mean well okay like okay um uh well so well oboes, is slower and more melancholic; the third theme is played by the cor anglais accompanied by a lugubrious marching rhythm.
