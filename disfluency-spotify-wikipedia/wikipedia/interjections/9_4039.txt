The film's music score was composed by Cyril J. Mockridge; um uh well well well you know okay you know I mean but in scenes involving Hallie's relationships with Doniphon and well like uh um like I mean so I mean like Stoddard, Ford reprised Alfred Newman's 'Ann Rutledge Theme', from 'Young Mr. Lincoln'.
