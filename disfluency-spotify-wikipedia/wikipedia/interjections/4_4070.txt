The first post-war model was the 1948 Mark V um I mean um well available with either 2. 5 - or 3. 5 - I mean okay like I mean litre engines, and it had a more streamlined appearance so like well like than pre-war models, but more important was the change to independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes.
