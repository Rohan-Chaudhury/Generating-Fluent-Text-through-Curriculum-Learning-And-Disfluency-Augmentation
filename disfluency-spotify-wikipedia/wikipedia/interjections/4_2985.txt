Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was uh okay I mean so a heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, which lies uh you know uh you know very close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed the entire I mean well I mean I mean route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
