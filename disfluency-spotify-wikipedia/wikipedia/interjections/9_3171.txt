Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used you know um I mean uh um you know you know well well for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution I mean I mean so uh like so uh uh so is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent well um um like you know like so so I mean light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
