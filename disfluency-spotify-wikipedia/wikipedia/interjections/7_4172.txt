The main transmitter is now located on the ridge between Cullowhee well uh um I mean so okay I mean and Waynesville, while there is a construction permit for booster station well uh so I mean I mean so uh WWCU - FM1 in Cullowhee itself, which is somewhat blocked from the main signal by terrain shielding.
