Six new Alstom Coradia LINT trainsets were purchased um I mean I mean so in order to replace and retire the 3 Bombardier Talent trainsets which, so okay like like along with the 2 extra passing loops, will double so so you know you know the number of trains on the line to four and reduce wait times.
