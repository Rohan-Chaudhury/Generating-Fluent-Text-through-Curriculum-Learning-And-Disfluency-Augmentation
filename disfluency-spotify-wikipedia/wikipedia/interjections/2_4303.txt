The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on like well the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact like okay conditions are flawed in the sense that these sensors uh I mean would not be able to distinguished between vibrations I mean um originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
