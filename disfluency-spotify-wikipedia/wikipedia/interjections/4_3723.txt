The Government moved that he be suspended, but Mr like you know I mean so. Baldwin was supported by the Opposition 'Coalition' and by um like I mean uh independent MP Rob Oakeshott and WA Nationals MP Tony Crook, so you know well um and the resulting vote on suspending Mr. Baldwin for 24 hours failed 71 - 72.
