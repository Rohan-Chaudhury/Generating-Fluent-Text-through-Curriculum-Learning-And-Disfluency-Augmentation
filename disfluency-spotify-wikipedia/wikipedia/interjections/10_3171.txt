Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for I mean you know you know um uh like okay I mean well like the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution like well okay okay um uh um um like well is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light so you know like okay you know um um so okay okay bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
