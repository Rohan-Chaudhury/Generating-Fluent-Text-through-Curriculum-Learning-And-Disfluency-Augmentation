The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded like so you know um so okay uh like I mean on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible uh I mean uh I mean okay you know okay um uh wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these like I mean so uh I mean like okay you know I mean sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
