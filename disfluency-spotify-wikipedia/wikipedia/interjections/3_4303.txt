The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on I mean I mean you know the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions you know well like are flawed in the sense that these sensors would like okay so not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from so you know you know the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
