Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip okay like uh uh like is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize so um um I mean you know the temperature, and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
