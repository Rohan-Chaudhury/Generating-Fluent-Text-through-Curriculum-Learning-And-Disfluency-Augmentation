Although Elliott was running for the UUP he was uh you know so like well um um so I mean well also being actively supported by the DUP, the TUV and okay I mean uh you know um well I mean uh you know I mean UKIP. The Tory party also refused to run a candidate so you know well I mean well like so you know well you know in Fermanagh South Tyrone despite running in 16 out of 18 constituencies.
