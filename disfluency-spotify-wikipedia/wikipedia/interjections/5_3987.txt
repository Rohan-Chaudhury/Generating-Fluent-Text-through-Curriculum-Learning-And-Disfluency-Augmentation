The couple only used parts of the ground floor and sadly like so uh you know so the rest of the house became little more so well I mean I mean okay than a ruin - until in 1986 Cornelia Bayley (the you know so okay I mean well present owner) bought Plas Teg for £ 750, 000 which included a grant of £ 250, 000 from CADW.
