The State of Nebraska halted the liquor licensing um so um I mean process before the 2006 season, and the organizers okay uh so well were forced to modify the rules for vending of alcoholic like you know you know like beverages for the 2006 festival season, and forced compliance in order for the festival to receive the required liquor licence.
