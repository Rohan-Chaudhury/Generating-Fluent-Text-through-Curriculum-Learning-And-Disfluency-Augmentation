On 12 June 1808, while Lasalle was on his way okay well so well to Valladolid, in the village of Cabezón, he like like you know well met a resistance of about 7, 000 men under uh I mean um I mean General Cuesta, deployed along the Cabezón bridge to bar the road to Burgos against oncoming French divisions.
