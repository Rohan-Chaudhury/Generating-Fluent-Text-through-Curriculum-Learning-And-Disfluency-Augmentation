If some energy is placed in the 'sender' coil, provided like well I mean like um you know you know you know uh you know the Q of the transmitting circuit is significantly greater I mean um okay you know you know like like like okay uh than the coupling coefficient, then much of the power can be absorbed by the receiving coil and can be tapped off.
