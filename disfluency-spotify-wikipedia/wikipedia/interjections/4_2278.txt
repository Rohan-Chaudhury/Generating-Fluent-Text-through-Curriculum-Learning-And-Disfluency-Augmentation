It was concluded that this crash was a type like uh so I mean known as C. F. I. T. (Controlled Flight Into um I mean like uh Terrain) and that there were no defects with the aircraft or okay okay like like its systems which contributed to the crash, for this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain.
