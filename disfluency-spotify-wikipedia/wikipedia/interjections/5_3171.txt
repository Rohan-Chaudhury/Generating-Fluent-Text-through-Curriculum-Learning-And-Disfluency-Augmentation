Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used so uh you know um um for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is well okay so um uh to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent like I mean okay uh I mean light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
