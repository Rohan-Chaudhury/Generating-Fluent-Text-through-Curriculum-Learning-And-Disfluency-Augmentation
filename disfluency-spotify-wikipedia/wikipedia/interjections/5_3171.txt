Resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but you know um um well well a simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light I mean okay like I mean um bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
