This can be shown dramatically when a molecule is adsorbed um well okay you know uh okay okay um um on a surface - the STM image may so um so well like uh you know well uh appear to have either INCREASED or DECREASED height at so you know uh well um uh you know uh well that feature, although the geometry alone is certainly an INCREASED height.
