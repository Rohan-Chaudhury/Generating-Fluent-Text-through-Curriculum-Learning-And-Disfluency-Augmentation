Originally connecting Effingham, Illinois to Cairo, Illinois, it was like so well um okay like I mean so uh a heavily - traveled highway before Interstate 57, which lies very okay you know uh so like well like I mean um close to most of Illinois 37 (indeed the I mean like I mean uh well uh I mean so you know entire route north of Pulleys Mills), supplanted it as a through route.
