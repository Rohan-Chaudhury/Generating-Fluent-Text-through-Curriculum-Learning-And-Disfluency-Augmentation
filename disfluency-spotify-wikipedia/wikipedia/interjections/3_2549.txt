Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip so well I mean is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature, um like you know and by making small adjustments to the inside temperature like like I mean of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized.
