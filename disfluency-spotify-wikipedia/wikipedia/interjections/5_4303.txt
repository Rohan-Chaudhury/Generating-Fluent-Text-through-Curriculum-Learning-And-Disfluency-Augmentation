The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, to measure so uh I mean I mean so vibrations and possible wheel impact conditions are flawed in the sense that these you know you know you know okay like sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
