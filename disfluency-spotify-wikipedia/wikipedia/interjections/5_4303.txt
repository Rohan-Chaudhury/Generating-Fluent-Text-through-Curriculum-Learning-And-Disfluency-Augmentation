The promise of mote technology vibration sensors embedded like uh okay I mean like on the railcar itself, to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact so like um um I mean conditions are flawed in the sense that these um you know uh so you know sensors would not be able to distinguished between vibrations originating okay so okay uh well from the rail track or the rail wheel / bogie.
