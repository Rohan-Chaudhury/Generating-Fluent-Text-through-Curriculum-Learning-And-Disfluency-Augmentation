The first post-war model was the 1948 Mark V available so I mean okay with either 2. 5 - or 3. 5 - litre you know I mean well engines, and it had a more streamlined appearance than I mean uh I mean pre-war models, but more important was the change to independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes.
