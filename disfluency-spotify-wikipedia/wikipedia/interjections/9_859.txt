Despite the fact that it is sometimes called the otaheite cashew, 'Syzygium malaccense' is so um like you know I mean okay okay so I mean not related to cashew -- an important distinction because cashew nuts (but not cashew uh I mean uh well so I mean so well well fruits) may trigger allergic reactions while rose apple fruit has not been observed to do so.
