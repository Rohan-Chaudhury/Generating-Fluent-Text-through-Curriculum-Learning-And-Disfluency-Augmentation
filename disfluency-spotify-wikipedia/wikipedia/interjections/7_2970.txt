One particular defender of the idea of species selection is S. J. Gould who okay I mean so uh I mean I mean well has proposed the view that there exist macroevolutionary processes which shape evolution beyond the level like I mean well like I mean uh uh of species and are not driven by the microevolutionary mechanisms already characterized by evolutionary biologists.
