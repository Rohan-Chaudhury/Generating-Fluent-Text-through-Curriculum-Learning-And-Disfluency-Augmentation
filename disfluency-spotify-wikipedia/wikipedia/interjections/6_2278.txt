It was concluded that this crash was a type well like okay you know so I mean known as C. F. I. T. (Controlled Flight so um um so I mean you know Into Terrain) and that there were no defects okay uh um like um um with the aircraft or its systems which contributed to so well like you know okay well the crash, for this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain.
