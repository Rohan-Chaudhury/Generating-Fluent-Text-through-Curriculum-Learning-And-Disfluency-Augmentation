Resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - resistor - diode networks and FETs are sometimes used for the nonlinear element, but a simpler traditional solution is to use a thermistor or an ordinary incandescent light bulb; both provide a resistance that increases with temperature as the current through them increases.
