Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a regular like so well so Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some like um uh well shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of like um okay you know which is the fact that I have literally not had a job for the you know you know okay okay past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like um I mean um um a gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my so so I mean you know bank account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for uh so um uh a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
