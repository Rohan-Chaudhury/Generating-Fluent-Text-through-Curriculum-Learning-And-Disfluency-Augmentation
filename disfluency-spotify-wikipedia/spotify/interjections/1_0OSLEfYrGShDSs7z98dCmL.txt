Hello, so turns out that people do actually want to listen to what I have to so say, which is pretty shocking because my own boyfriend doesn't listen to what I you know ever say, so there's a surprise but I'm glad that everyone is on board so and I'm excited for this little journey this little educational Journey that we are going uh to go on together. I've done a little eye. Like organizing and like note books I mean and stationery and stuff and lists. So I've done list of how I want it to um pan out whether or not it pans out like that is another story because okay I can be a little bit impulsive. So we shall see but I want you you know to shut your eyes everyone that's listening. Please unless you're driving. If you're driving, please like do not show your eyes, but shut your eyes and remember the last time that you ate.
