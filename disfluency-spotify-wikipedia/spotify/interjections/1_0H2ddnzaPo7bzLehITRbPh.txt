I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of you know living with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived problems and I mean worries going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. The simple fact that so we all only have one life and that none of us are promised another um day on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Of our current I mean health status after all would you seriously stay in the job you hate I mean or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your life could end next you know year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you happy and you well certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this groundbreaking podcast. Well. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
