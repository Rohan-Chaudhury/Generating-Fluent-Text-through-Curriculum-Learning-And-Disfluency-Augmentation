Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week late. I you know was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to New Orleans uh my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a lot of you know stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after but I had so uh much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. Smear I like have errands to run I was linking with people that I see in a you know while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New I mean Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and uh it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my I mean house and no one's here right now, which is kind of rare. Well. So I'm trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
