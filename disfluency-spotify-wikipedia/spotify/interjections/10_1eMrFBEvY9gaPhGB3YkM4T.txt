Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was okay um okay okay you know I mean uh um um um very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front okay like so okay you know well so well well well of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules so like okay like okay well well uh uh uh again. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use um uh okay I mean you know so well um you know well the small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix like so like okay I mean um uh um well um the lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than well okay uh uh well you know I mean like like okay traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. I mean you know you know uh um uh um so you know I mean. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in um okay like um so you know you know I mean you know like my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
