Usually I wait to reflect on my guest and work on the introduction for like um Saturday mornings. There's no sleeping in my house because we have a puppy and he uh um likes to get up really early. But today's a little bit different. I keep uh uh thinking about our guest. Mrs. Whitman's story. I know her story is going to so okay resonate with so many of you out there. I want you to listen. This you know so one all the way through. If you don't know. Mrs. Whitman, you're going to know her um um pretty well at the end of this half hour episode this half hour goes by okay I mean fast. Now. I know this sounds like a Shameless plug but it isn't please you know I mean share the episode people need to hear her story. They need to hear about uh um her resiliency. They need to hear about how she weather's so many different storms that you know um have taken place in her life. Thanks for listening. Please let me know what uh you know you think write a review.
