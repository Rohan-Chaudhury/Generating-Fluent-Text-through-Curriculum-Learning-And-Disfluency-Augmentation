Thank you to everybody who listened to the last episode I mean and welcome to anybody who is a new listener here. So on this episode, I'm so going to be doing something a little bit different I am going so well I'm trying to put together this like algorithm. And so I just wanted to you know kind of film and put together. Kind of making it I guess is the best you know way to put it I mean so I've been looking into like I've talked about in okay the past I talked about in the last episode that I really am a uh big fan of the Bowman Chrome rookie cards. So not the Bowman Prospect cards I mean the ones with the RC logo. So I was putting together some statistics with the um PSA Pop reports and then the pricing of those specific cards, so Here's so basically what I got, so like I was looking at like players basically I use trout as a baseline, but I think something that's when I originally made this.
