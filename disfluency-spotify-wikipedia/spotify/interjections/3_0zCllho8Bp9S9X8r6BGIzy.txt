I actually I actually didn't have the mic in my hand. So. I uh okay well got a fat callus on my hand right now. Sorry, I like sandpaper. Uh you know like. It's all right. But yeah, so sorry about that long break we took we were uh like so just really busy with midterms papers. We went on a Hiatus we just were busy. Um well well. Yeah. Sorry, not a Hiatus. That means we're like temporarily broken up. It's a short break. Okay spotty spotty neck.
