Hey guys, it's Jeff hammer or your Law of Attraction coach with the dominating Edge I mean I mean today. We'll speak about the Benjamin Franklin technique. So stick around when I was um uh a kid. Kid growing up in Minnesota. Oh, maybe I was about 13 or well I mean 14 years old. I was having a tough time making a decision on whether I uh well wanted to accept an offer to play in the school's jazz band. I was a you know uh trumpet player. Already playing with the concert band and Orchestra So although I was flattered by the invitation. I knew.
