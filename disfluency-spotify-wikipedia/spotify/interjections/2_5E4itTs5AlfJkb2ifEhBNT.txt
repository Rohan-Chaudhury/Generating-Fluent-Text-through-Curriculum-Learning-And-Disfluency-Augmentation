So we just got a letter so for you here, we wanted to you know so talk about a few things that we've been stumbling upon over the last few days since well I mean the finale and couple things we want to talk about before the uh um reunions show just in case that It gets wild and we don't want to you okay well know, take up too much time in the podcast after that. So we're um okay yeah, the internet is swirling with post interviews and insights into the show. And you know so I think now that they can be open and doing you know, you definitely see you know like certain couples out there on the interview circuit and making appearances. And so we just want uh okay to talk about what we found out since the show and how we feel about it going into reunions and second seasons and spin-off and really we're looking for.
