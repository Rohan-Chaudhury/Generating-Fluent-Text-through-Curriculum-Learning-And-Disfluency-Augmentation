Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to leave you know like well fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on uh uh um Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to okay like I mean digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're I mean uh well going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. I mean um I mean. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to I mean you know like reiterate you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are well you know you know Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, okay um uh but they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging um um um your view of a player but we did learn some things some players had um well you know much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
