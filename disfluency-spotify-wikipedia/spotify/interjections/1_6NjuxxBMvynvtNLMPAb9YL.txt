Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get uh a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I so forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just okay listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm I mean in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm like training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as like possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's well just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or you know stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know so what that's going to be or when it will be but it just happens after I mean you listen to it for a while and then when you actually then go right I mean let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and uh you teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son uh or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
