Movers Netter just talking to teachers talking to teachers about academic research and evidence-based so uh practice with continuing professional development at PNA 1977 on Twitter is Netter. Just talking to uh okay teachers welcome to this week's Dale is NASA in association with you know you know the teacher development trusts and now proudly sponsored by John Kat educational. So we have like you know a strip Back Lean podcast this week. So there is no teacher development trusts section like um or the usual podcast pedagogy section where it's me and Rings into music film well so and books. They will return next week. So it's just stripped back to feature uh like me and the wonderful ormer Akbar in conversation. And the reason for this um well strict back podcast is that I'm recording especially early in the week this week because you know you know I have just been recording a couple of Epic podcast. So as I'm speaking to you now have literally just got off the phone to Daisy Krista.
