We think there is enough of that I mean well you know so well so um going on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast well like okay like so um you know is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being real being like like um um I mean uh I mean vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the opposite. We I mean like um well like okay like believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to grow well uh well so like well you know through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder that you know well I mean I mean um um like in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when our backs okay uh okay uh okay like you know are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
