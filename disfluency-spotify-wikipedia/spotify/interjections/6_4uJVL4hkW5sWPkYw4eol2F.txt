Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed you know you know okay um well uh Makai time major Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about you know well well you know um well gross rental yields in Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking uh like uh you know uh you know about Parnell given that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it I mean well well um um um is probably not likely an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Like well I mean so so okay. Well a couple of weeks ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the I mean um I mean well well okay large banks in New Zealand and they said can you comment on an article that I mean okay you know okay uh uh we're writing for our website where they were showing by the latest core logic data that like well well so um you know the the median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 um I mean you know well well well. Percent. Whereas a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and okay so uh um so uh they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
