Oh, hey guys. Hello surprise back. We got a little we just missed you so guys. So we just got a letter so for you here, we wanted to talk uh about a few things that we've been stumbling upon over the last few days um since the finale and couple things we want to talk about before the reunions show okay just in case that It gets wild and we don't want to you know, like take up too much time in the podcast after that. So we're yeah, the so internet is swirling with post interviews and insights into the show. And I think like now that they can be open and doing you know, you definitely see certain uh couples out there on the interview circuit and making appearances. And so we just like want to talk about what we found out since the show and how we feel about um it going into reunions and second seasons and spin-off and really we're looking for.
