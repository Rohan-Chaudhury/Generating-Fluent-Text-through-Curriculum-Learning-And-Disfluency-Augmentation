Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is um um well you know um so well so uh the fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals um you know well I mean I mean okay I mean I mean so in first place of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still so you know so you know you know okay okay okay so in first place due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Okay you know I mean uh you know well um uh like. Is it the tiebreaker because that would make the most sense, but of course um uh um I mean like um I mean so um not listen, I don't care if technically they're not in first. All I care so um so you know like well okay so well about is when you look at the points it is tied. This very moment so I mean I mean so well okay so um I mean and just the fact that that is the situation we are discussing right like okay well well like so um like okay now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four well uh okay okay uh uh uh so okay to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
