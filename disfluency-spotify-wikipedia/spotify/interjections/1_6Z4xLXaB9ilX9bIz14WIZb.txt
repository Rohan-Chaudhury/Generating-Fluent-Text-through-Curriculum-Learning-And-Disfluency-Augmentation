Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing it in like a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The men of Lewis okay and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks of like the Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day of traveling so the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in okay their midst. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured you know by bison meat that had been hung up to dry. If it decided it wanted uh to snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware of the looming uh danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
