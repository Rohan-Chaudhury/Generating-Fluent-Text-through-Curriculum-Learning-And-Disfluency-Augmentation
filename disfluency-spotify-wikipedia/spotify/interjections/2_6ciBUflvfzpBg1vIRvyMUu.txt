Hey, I don't even know how I mean so to start. It's nice to be back again. It is coming up on spring time I mean um and I'm excited about that because it's going to be nice warm weather. Um um. Sometimes I like to say that I like cold weather, but I think I like warm so well every now and then and there's some big changes that are coming up for okay you know me. I can't quite sure. I mean I can share them. I've just you know so decided not to for quite some time. But once I do decide to share um uh promise, you'll understand why it's a pretty big life change. I'm not pregnant don't even assume um so so, but I'm definitely making a little change. I would say little I guess but pretty um you know big change in life, so I came to share that with you all but instead of just dwelling.
