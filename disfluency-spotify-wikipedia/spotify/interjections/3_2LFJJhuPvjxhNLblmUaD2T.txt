Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. We are like uh I mean joined. Once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very special episode. I like like okay I mean these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological career of the well you know um competitor or the coach that we interview in this case. We interviewed. And since it was um okay you know the second time we had him on we'd already covered his career. And so uh um I mean I got to talk about a lot of things on this show and I okay like I mean had I'd get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on a lot of different things okay well you know and we kind of went through a couple topics one was his little okay okay you know brother Greg just want his fifth State title High School in New York. And so um um I mean we talked a little bit about that and then Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
