together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how um well so okay so uh um uh so Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets up um so so um okay like well okay well and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be um okay you know you know you know you know I mean well you know with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with so so well like um um so I mean you know the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to okay so so so you know like uh um uh him and he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus so like like so I mean um um like so says while I needed to be with the father but also need to go okay okay okay uh um okay I mean so well somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It uh well you know um well you know um I mean so is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being I mean so you know um okay okay okay well uh with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
