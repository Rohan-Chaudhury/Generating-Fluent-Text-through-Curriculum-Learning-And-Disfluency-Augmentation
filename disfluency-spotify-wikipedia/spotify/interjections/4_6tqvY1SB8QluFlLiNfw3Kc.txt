Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are well okay like okay so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the so well like I mean Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to okay um uh you know the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker well I mean well you know because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care you know like well well if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at I mean okay like well the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that so um uh okay is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the uh well well you know Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a um uh uh you know back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
