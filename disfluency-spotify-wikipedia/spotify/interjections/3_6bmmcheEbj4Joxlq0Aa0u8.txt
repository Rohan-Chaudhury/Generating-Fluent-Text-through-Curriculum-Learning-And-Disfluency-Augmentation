At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a um you know like Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six like I mean I mean feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting I mean so um on the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to well okay well notice a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person so like um who lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of like okay um sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly so I mean okay much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was you know well well obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated uh you know you know Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a well like so while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
