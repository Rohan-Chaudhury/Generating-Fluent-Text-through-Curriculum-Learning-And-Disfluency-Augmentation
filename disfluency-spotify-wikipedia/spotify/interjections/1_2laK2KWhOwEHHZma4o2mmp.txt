The Brian Golf Show for presented by Cobra Puma golf actual truck. Yeah, uh real good form before we get to talking about anything and everything to well do with golf shafts. I got to give a big thank you to the man so on the phone. His name is Don Brown. He is the senior director of I mean marketing Innovation for True Sports is golf division up true Sports encompasses a I mean lot. I know Don that you have a lot of product not just in um the Gulf side, but true also has what a Baseball division a Hockey so division lacrosse. Am I am I correct on all this before? Before we get okay going. Yeah, that is correct. So true Sports, so we were formerly known as uh True Timber Sports until about the middle of last year and then you know, uh we have a hockey Division. I lacrosse division are Baseball division and they are so all branded true. So it made sense for the parent company recalled to sports as so opposed to True Temper sports or to Templars were really just our golf division. So um yeah, we make a wide range of a cross product and hockey we dress players from the states to the helm.
