The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel uh so I mean Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading shockingly okay um you know racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully but uh okay so both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation you know okay you know fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake and eat it too okay I mean well with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying how the producers run okay well uh the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the show taking no accountability for it um um well was crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability you know I mean okay for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The show is specifically designed and run around um uh you know the notion of having a villain. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily you know so so ever after but every single season there will be multiple villains. Another user responded you know so you know digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
