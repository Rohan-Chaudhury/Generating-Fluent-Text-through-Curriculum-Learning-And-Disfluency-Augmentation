Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release um well like okay like well uh for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography and um um like you know so I mean um I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to the songs like so okay so well uh well and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower when I'm like I mean you know like uh um you know making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I just try you know okay uh um so like okay and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not even thinking so so okay like well um like about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just filled music so like okay okay okay you know uh and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all these musical uh um so like well uh uh landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to be or when it uh okay well uh you know you know well will be but it just happens after you listen to it for a while so well I mean well um um um and then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when you know okay um so I mean you know like those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So I mean uh well you know you know okay uh those little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
