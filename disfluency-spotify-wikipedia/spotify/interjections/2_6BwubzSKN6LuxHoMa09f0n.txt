Hey there. Thanks for listening to the decaying major podcast. Make sure you follow your favorite I mean um podcast. So you never miss an episode like this one or if you become a you know so premium user you can download the episode so you can listen to them like well offline like I do when you're on a plane or wherever you're traveling and like well also you can share this with your friends on Instagram. If you haven't done so I mean uh already be sure to download the Spotify app and search for D. Km/h or so uh browse podcast in your library tab. Lethargy said in head of sand pop it with a pin watch The Hour Glass Wall half-mast drop dead and unhinged what makes.
