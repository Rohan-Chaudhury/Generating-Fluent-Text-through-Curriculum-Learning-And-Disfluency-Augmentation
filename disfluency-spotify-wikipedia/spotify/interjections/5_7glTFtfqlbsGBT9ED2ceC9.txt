Hi and welcome to the fort down podcast. I'm Ben. I'm so and we're okay um like I mean uh here to talk about American football. So I go into the NFL after the well I mean I mean well I mean demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one with so okay well um you know Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and the AFC uh well okay uh you know Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This was the I mean well uh well I mean game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you play I mean I mean okay uh like that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much why you chose to be a you know like you know well okay broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a Broncos fan because well quite frankly well I mean you know like well because I have a horse and I went and I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
