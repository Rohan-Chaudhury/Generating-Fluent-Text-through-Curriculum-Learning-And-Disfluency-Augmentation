Hello, beautiful people and welcome to waking youth. My name is got a lotta gibberish. So. I'll be your host and I have to say I'm extremely happy to be here so with you today. And in this episode, I'll just be introducing waking youth. How like did I come up with this idea? And what waking youth is all about so you know over the summer I was listening to a lot of podcasts and I was thinking uh that I really wanted to work and focus on my creativity and when I started the uh semester I am Third-year communication student in Spain. I was also looking for an like initiative and I was feeling very stressed and very anxious and I realized that a lot um of my friends were also feeling like this because we're obviously we're very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and.
