What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk okay I mean so so well so like um well um about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode like you know okay you know you know okay like like uh okay Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really okay well well um like well I mean like you know so excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out you know so I mean so you know I mean so uh like you know to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just well uh so like um uh like um um like recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model you know so well uh well you know well you know uh so 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool well so um um uh so so you know I mean I mean looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand like you know uh well um okay uh so like uh and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires so well um okay well okay okay uh so you know and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the so like so I mean well okay you know uh uh uh track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I so uh okay well like I mean so well I mean like was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury you know okay I mean you know you know well uh uh okay I mean Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of you know um um well um okay you know I mean I mean you know Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one um so okay uh well okay okay I mean um like example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
