We're going to talk um um um you know I mean you know uh uh about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model you know so um so well okay I mean I mean S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really like well you know uh I mean okay well um excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out so you know uh um I mean so so I mean to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this so you know um you know um you know well I mean episode. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that uh okay uh okay I mean so you know um came out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get I mean I mean so okay well well uh like these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost uh uh I mean um um well um okay 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these so well so uh like I mean you know so new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform like you know so uh well so you know uh better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. Well I mean uh uh well like I mean well. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort okay okay uh I mean well I mean um I mean of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and uh um well well I mean I mean I mean um services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would uh so you know I mean like so like I mean love and the track package is one example, but what I think is an like uh so you know okay like um okay even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
