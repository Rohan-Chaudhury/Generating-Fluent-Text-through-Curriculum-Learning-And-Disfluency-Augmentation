Sunday seems to be our day where we really try to get like our act together before the work week. It includes the kids because we okay really enjoy our time off on Saturdays and Sundays as a family and we just I mean got a lotta things that we tend to do on the weekends. We're uh busy but Sunday, especially given against towards the evening as like look kids. Do you know you have any homework what needs to be done for tomorrow? Get your clothes I mean out clean your rooms. Let's start packing lunches. Etc it's it's just a reminder well that we gotta get back to work and school tomorrow morning. I like teasing um my kids at this time because it's a i you guys. I know that you know school is your favorite. You guys can't even wait to go back and okay like know I hate school. I don't think they really do like I think they okay like to see their friends. But yeah schools work and their you're not in kindergarten anymore, right? We got through versus third grade.
