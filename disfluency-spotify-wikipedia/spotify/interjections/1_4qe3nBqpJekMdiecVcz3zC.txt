Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic uh of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind of interesting I mean email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and telling um me how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation where you know I guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting a uh divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out well she was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing well is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the interesting uh thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife without okay any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
