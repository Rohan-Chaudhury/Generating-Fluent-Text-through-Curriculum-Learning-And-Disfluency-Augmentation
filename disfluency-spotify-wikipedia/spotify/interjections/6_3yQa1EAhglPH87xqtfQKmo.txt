This is I mean um uh like well I mean something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is you're uh like okay um you know like not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel like so uh uh well well um things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel okay so like so well like like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're uh well okay well um so going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's going so like so I mean so um to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous okay um uh uh okay like hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your life you know um uh well okay so telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you well I mean so so I mean so want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for you. So like I mean like well okay uh I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
