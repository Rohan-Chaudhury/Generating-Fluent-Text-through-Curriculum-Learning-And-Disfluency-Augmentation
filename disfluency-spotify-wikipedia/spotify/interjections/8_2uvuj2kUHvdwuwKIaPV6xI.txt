July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year so I mean well I mean uh so okay okay old came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita like so like so you know um um well Lopez over dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over you know like so like like I mean um uh San Jose the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic you know okay well well like you know well like as it seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just so well uh you know well I mean like like like most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The you know I mean so okay like okay like um drugs burned hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began uh uh you know I mean you know I mean uh um to hallucinate and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
