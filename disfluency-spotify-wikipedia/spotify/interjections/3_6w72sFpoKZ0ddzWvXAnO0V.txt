But back to chapter 24 to see what it actually is about um okay um today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to biology for bastards teaching biology and the I mean um I mean most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John Doe d. Okay um okay. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter at a time okay uh okay this week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
