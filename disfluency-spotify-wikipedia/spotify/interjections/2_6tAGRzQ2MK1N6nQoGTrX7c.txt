Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going I mean well through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be I mean uh laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can also well um do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make so well sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you have well you know your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet Flat on well I mean the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either you're um I mean sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. I mean well. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
