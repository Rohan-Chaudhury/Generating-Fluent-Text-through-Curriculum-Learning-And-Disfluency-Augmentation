And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be uh like um like like like you know you know um well looking at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using I mean um like well so um I mean well so okay and speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart behind this so uh well you know I mean like well okay okay so is that as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously avoid okay you know I mean so I mean well um so uh I mean but we will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. I so well you know so like okay okay well like okay am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
