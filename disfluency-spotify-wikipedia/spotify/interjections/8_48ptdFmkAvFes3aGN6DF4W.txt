Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be your host um so okay well uh um well I mean for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and so okay like okay so well uh so to renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse um okay I mean uh like so well uh is taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and like okay like you know okay you know well um greatest day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let uh you know well um you know okay uh um anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation to like okay I mean like okay you know um so come to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
