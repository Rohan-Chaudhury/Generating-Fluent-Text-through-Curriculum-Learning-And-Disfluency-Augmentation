The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that like were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me I mean how we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you like know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have okay had when we first started out this would have been way way easier and you know it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far um the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. In one place I mean so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything you know and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on your phone right there I mean free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the creation tools. You need you know to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
