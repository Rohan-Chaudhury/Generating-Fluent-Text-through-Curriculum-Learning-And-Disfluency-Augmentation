This is Ottoman and I'm going to talk about your Energies. Most of the time I mean uh well um we do not acknowledge the presence of energy. In and around us. In fact, even well I mean so uh this physical body which appears to be in physical form is essentially energy because like okay uh okay if you break down all your tissues into tiny tiny cells and tighten cells into okay like uh uh Small little Adam and Adam in two electrons. What are they? They are energies. So like so well. They are a form of energy your body is in energy. Your thoughts like so I mean uh are also an energy. Your emotions are Energies. So we are bunch of energy beings. Who are.
