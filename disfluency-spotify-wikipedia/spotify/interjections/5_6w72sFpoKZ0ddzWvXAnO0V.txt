But back to chapter 24 to see what it actually is okay so so um um about today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to biology for bastards teaching biology uh okay uh well like and the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John Doe um uh well like well D. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter well um well well so at a time this week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
