The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were friends okay like well okay okay like and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we do I mean uh uh so okay okay it how we get it out there how we record it. And you okay okay so okay okay um know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would you know like okay uh well like have had when we first started out this would have been way way uh I mean well okay um I mean easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor you know like well uh like you know is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you okay uh um well you know um need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any um okay like um okay uh fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it you know you know um um you know okay on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you you know I mean I mean well okay okay all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you uh so you know well okay okay know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
