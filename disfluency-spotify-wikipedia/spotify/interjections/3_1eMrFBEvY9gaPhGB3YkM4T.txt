Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was I mean so uh very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in okay you know okay front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. So so you know. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small I mean uh so lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. You know like okay. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. Like I mean uh. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The uh so you know first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral you know so I mean vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
