Yo, yo, yo, what's up everyone? I guess I'll kick off this podcast addressing uh I mean probably the biggest talk in sports right now. Tom Brady greatest of all time so okay Now if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you that he's staying well well put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying put it I mean well just doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody that has okay like been in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one team uh uh just doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense to me. So it okay well doesn't make sense to me for this man the go out and play for another okay like team at 43 years old after spending his entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just doesn't make sense for.
