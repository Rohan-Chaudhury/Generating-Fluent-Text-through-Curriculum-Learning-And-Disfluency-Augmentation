Okay you know like so I mean well um. He'd heard years before if you do. Do this evil thing you um well like I mean I mean you know like shall have an evil son your nation shall become prey to Terrors and so um like so I mean uh okay tears rivers of blood will flow.

He couldn't think about those words like like so well you know you know okay now his sin had already been committed now, he must be beside his wife in greet his child in the midst of the Wind and Rain.
