What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about so okay the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model uh like S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really like um excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on so like this shout out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We you know I mean were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the uh okay model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking like okay new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand well okay and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these I mean uh brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. I mean uh. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I I mean I mean was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of like uh this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services okay um that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package okay um is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
