As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot um so you know I mean well and a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so so so I mean so so it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that okay okay like well okay room was through the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one okay like okay I mean I mean room, which was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us I mean I mean so you know um being students not our number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody okay well you know well okay could win and there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm uh like uh you know like not too sure what is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of okay um you know you know okay curve that but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody um like like you know like was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand you know well so okay so dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
