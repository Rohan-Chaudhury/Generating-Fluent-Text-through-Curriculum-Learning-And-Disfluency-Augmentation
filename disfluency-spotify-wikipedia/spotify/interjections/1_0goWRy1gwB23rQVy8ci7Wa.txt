Welcome to episode 155 of the Marvel Studios News podcast. My name is Sean you know Gerber joined by Paul Herman. How you doing? Paul? I'm getting over being sick and um just getting over being sick. I'm fine. But just it's weird being sick and trying so to recoup its weird. But I'm headed. I'm headed the right way. I'm headed the right direction. Well. I think so, but yeah, thanks for asking. I'm glad you're on. On the mend we uh did a couple patreon exclusive shows over the weekend or Friday night and you were so sounding a little rough. But at least you know, you stuck it out for our wonderful I mean patrons absolutely over there, which I know they appreciate so for this episode or so actually before I get started with the episode make sure you're following us on our I mean Instagram at Marvel Studios news. I'm doing a lot of things over there doing daily um MCU trivia, some of you are doing very very well. Good job, uh but also we gave I put up a post on their a week or so ago offering an opportunity.
