Keep it up permanently. Let me tell you something. You already know the world ain't well all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care so how tough you are. It will beat you to your knees and keep you there well permanently. If you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, like but it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you uh can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving uh forward. That's how winning is done. Well, if you know what you're so worth then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing you know to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be you know because of him or her or anybody cowards do that. And that ain't uh you you better than that. It's about how hard you can get hit and uh keep moving forward. Yo. Yo yo, it's your boy Evan. Those were little bit of words from Rocky.
