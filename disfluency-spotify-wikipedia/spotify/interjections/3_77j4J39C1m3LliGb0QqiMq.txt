The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when uh so I mean Rachel Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included you know um I mean her reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was like so so handled Tastefully but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its um so like inclusion on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show okay like okay to have its cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user you know uh okay and ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment um um well for bullying and the show taking no accountability for it was crap at like so okay no point at The Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability for their okay I mean well role in facilitating toxic environments. The show is specifically designed and run around the um okay well notion of having a villain. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every well I mean okay single season there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past okay okay you know infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
