Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking to um so like like I mean okay I mean uh well you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology and health so um I mean so uh um I mean well I mean because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you have like um so um um so like okay so in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional life like so like you know well um okay well I mean spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many questions from like uh like okay you know okay you know you know well people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is our time well um well so uh well okay you know I mean for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So well I mean like so I mean you know I mean so I mean here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 so okay uh okay okay you know um uh well years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I am but it's a uh I mean you know like I mean you know uh like I mean little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their families. I promise I am you know okay well you know um I mean um uh so genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
