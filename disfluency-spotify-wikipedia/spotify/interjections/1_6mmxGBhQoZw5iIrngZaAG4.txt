Hello and welcome back into the hard foul. I'm your host Pearson Fowler with me um as always from Gamecock central.com the bad luck charm in South Carolina Gamecocks this entire you know weekend Colin Taylor Colin. I hate that you have to wear that albatross around your neck, but um you had a busy weekend. He did a lot of travel. It's much appreciated okay Gamecock fans everywhere appreciate your vigilance your dedication to traveling and I sound like uh I'm being sarcastic because it's not a clock. In the morning, but I'm being serious because uh Friday you were in Colombia. You covered the baseball game and then Saturday like morning you woke up and drove to Tuscaloosa. Watch the basketball game. And then you know you said you stayed overnight in Hoover or Birmingham somewhere thereabouts and then drove to Clemson, I mean South Carolina first thing Sunday morning to cover the baseball game then came back to I mean Colombia. And the now you are back here in downtown Columbia at nine o'clock on Monday morning again admirable seriously everybody appreciates.
