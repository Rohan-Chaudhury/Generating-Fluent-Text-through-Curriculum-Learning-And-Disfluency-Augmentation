Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room uh 237. So for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie I mean the original old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one um of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first uh ones she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I uh was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. Like. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
