Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If you uh I mean so uh follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know that I like um like you know post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of god. Uh you know well like. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking okay okay you know like at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be so so well well using and speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart like so I mean well behind this is that as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously so I mean well um avoid but we will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. So I mean you know well. I am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
