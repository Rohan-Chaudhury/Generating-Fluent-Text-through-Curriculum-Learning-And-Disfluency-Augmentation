Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on Vale. I uh was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder song well as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And all it okay did for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for okay me of all time, which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, well first of all when you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got well to go. Um, man, I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's like my favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on it. You know. Is that Love's in Need of Love today? We need to give the love back well to ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted to get you to consider you know that you can apply this to lots of things in your life and um fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
