Ain't there was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that well so so like well like well came from growing up between worlds and of the push and pull of the well um well uh okay well okay happy and the hard then I went to a school for missionaries kids in Germany you know like you know um um um uh when I was in ninth grade, and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable like um you know I mean well I mean well differences. I hadn't quite been able to put a finger on we're not just in um you know so you know so so you know me my friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
