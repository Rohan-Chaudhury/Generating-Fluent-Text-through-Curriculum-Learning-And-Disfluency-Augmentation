Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room um I mean 237. So for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie you know so the original old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this okay you know one. It was one of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of well okay the first ones she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to uh you know this movie when I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity uh like and violence seems wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself like I mean that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
