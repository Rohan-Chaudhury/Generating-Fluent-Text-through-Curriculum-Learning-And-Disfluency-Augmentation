The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were uh okay um uh so so well friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how I mean um like like I mean you know like we do it how we get it out there how we record it. Like I mean well you know uh so well. And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we like well uh well like well okay would have had when we first started out this would have been way you know I mean you know well you know so uh way easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so you know um uh I mean okay um so anchor is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives well well so um um you know I mean you everything you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or uh so I mean um so um um any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it uh you know um I mean okay so uh on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you um well uh so like you know uh all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound um so so okay you know um well good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
