Welcome to the special edition of between two Blue Devils. It's parent-teacher conferences here at well Tommy's high school. So I thought maybe I would go around and do something um special a little bit different going to go around and ask random teachers if I mean they want to answer a question that my students have written. I'm going to so pull a question out of the grab bag. It's going to IAM impromptu, they're going okay to answer it and we're going to get some interesting answers. I'm okay sure in the meantime, I want to let you know that tomorrow. We have another so official guest and I cannot wait to interview our next guest here on between like two Blue Devils. This individual is awesome. And the story that they're going to share you know with you is unbelievable. So you want to make sure you tune in this well weekend. Make sure you subscribe so you don't miss that episode when it drops got to tell you.
