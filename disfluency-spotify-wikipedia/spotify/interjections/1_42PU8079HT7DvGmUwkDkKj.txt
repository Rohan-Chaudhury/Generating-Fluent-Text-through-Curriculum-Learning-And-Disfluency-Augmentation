Good morning, everyone Welcome to our Friday spending time with Jesus podcast today. I like wanted us to look at Romans chapter 1 the entire book of Romans is jam-packed okay with Theology and interesting thoughts and just like amazing Epic. Ders that people okay quote all the time and Romans chapter 1 is really no different and okay Romans 1 we're dealing with our sexuality. We're dealing with idolatry. We're dealing with like the question of is the law of God really written on the human heart no well matter where they're at. No matter where they've grown up or what they've heard all you know their lives and it's an incredible chapter it lists out all the ways that we uh can act basically in sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that.
