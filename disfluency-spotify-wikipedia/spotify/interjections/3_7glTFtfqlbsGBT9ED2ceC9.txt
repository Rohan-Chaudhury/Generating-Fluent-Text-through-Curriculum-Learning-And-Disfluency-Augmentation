Hi and welcome to the fort down podcast. I'm Ben. I'm so and we're here well well okay to talk about American football. So I go into the NFL after the demo um like you know for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one so like you know with Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl okay um uh and the AFC Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the jets. You know uh okay. This was the game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and I mean like okay so you play that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much you know uh you know why you chose to be a broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a Broncos um well uh fan because well quite frankly because I have a horse and I went and like so um I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
