Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for um well you know like you know I mean you know you know uh our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original like so well um I mean like okay like um old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one of my like I mean you know you know um uh like okay well mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she saw like you know uh um like uh okay I mean so in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was I mean so you know um uh like okay okay well about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. You know I mean like uh okay uh like you know you know. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
