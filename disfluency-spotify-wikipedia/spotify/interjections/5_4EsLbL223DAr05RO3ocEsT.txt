Grand Prince Vasily the third ruler of Muscovy raced toward his wife's bed chamber well okay I mean like um the fateful day had finally arrived. His first child was about to be born as I mean I mean you know uh like he rushed past the Windows. He heard the crack of thunder and a deluge you know like okay uh well of rain spattering against the glass. He stopped in his tracks the weather reminding well I mean uh well okay him of a prophecy. He'd heard years before if you do. Do this evil thing uh um I mean uh okay you shall have an evil son your nation shall become prey to Terrors and tears rivers you know like um uh okay of blood will flow. The heads of the mighty will fall your cities will so uh um you know I mean be devoured by Flames. He shook his head. He couldn't think about those words now well I mean um uh I mean his sin had already been committed now, he must be beside his wife in greet his child in the midst of the Wind and Rain.
