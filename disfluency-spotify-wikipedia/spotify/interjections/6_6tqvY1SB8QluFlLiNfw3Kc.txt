Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are okay so okay well uh you know so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the uh you know like like uh like Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the tiebreak, you know I mean like like okay uh which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would make the you know you know um um okay uh most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if technically they're not okay uh um um well uh in first. All I care about is when you look at the points it is you know I mean you know you know okay uh tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the situation we are discussing uh you know well okay okay okay right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes so um okay um so like four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
