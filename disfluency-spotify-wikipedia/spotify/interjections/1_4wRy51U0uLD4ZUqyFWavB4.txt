Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I am too but I'm trying to like pretend I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this you know podcast episode set up because my microphone I feel like it's only really good for um one person and that I feel like our audio is always a little okay off and you guys have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it you know we're probably going to have to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome to uh yeah, we said it with me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time um tuning in. This is a mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice so questions that you emailed to me and Miss thing at gmail.com. And I would say I mean it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
