I'm one of the three founders from medical and you our um uh um listeners voted Tiffany Walling McGarity on Pitch Island going from a phone call to like you know I mean the pitch room isn't an easy trick to pull off today. We'll hear a pitch the I mean so you know likes of which we've never had on the show before. What does it pitch sound well I mean okay like before any revenues even before the product is built in all the founder uh like I mean has is an idea and a gut feeling that that idea could turn into well well you know a big business today on the show. What a pitch sounds like when so okay okay all you have are a few scratches on the back of the metaphorical napkin I mean I mean I mean from gimlet. This is the pitch. I'm Josh puccio. Let's meet the investors and Maya um um like Bittner Maya built to financial tech companies and sold them Bowl. Now. She's out scouting startups for Sequoia. One.
