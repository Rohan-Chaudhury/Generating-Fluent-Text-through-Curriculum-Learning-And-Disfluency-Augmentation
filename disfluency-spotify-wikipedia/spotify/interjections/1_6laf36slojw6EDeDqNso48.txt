I've never even been to Oklahoma. I'm pretty sure it's where the wind goes whipping down uh the plains and up until recently that's about what I knew of it. But now I uh know it's also the ancestral home of two warring American factions those no-good greasers okay and those rotten sotius. Greetings and welcome to fuckboys of literature. I'm your host okay Emily Edwards. What is it about this book? That just gets it I mention um it on Twitter and it gets love letters. So with me today is writer journalist so Leslie gray Streeter. How are you today? I am really good. I'm really good. Like. Thank you. I am so excited to have you on because you suggested a book that I was embarrassed to say that I had. Never.
