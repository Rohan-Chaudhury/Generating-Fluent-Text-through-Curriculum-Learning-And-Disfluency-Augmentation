Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on vale. You know so. I was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder song okay you know as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And all it did well I mean for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me of all time, like well which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, first of so okay all when you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got to go. Um, you know okay man, I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's my favorite uh um Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on it. Is um like that Love's in Need of Love today? We need to give the love back to ourselves so uh to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted to get you to consider I mean I mean that you can apply this to lots of things in your life and um so fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
