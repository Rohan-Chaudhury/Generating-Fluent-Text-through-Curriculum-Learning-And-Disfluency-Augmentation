Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get like um okay a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget well okay um the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just uh you know like listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm well okay like in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training okay like like gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, you know okay okay but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. I mean you know okay. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or well I mean okay lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you well okay I mean don't know what that's going to be or when it will be I mean okay you know but it just happens after you listen to it for a while and then you know so okay when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography um you know you know when those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So like I mean I mean those little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
