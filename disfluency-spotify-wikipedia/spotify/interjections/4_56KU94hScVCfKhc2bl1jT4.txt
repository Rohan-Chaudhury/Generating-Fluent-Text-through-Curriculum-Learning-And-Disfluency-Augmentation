Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really I mean you know well well appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this so well okay okay way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something you know um so like we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about well I mean okay uh it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. Um so so uh. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is the I mean uh you know okay Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led like I mean you know I mean them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he so so like like was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
