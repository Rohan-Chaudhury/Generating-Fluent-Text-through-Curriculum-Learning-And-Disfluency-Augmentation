Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast like with your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for tuning uh in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what okay why when and how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to me, let uh me at least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for okay about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at uh a nursing home from there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting so working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice you know World, which is really where I wanted to be I was able to sit so with people for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we well were able to see each other for a bit more than five or ten you know minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple you know minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've well been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
