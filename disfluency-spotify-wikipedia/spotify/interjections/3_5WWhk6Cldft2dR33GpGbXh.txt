It's so I mean so okay good and how well for starters it's free and their creation tools that let you record so so so and edit your podcast right from your phone or computer and anchor distributes your um um uh podcast everywhere to Spotify Apple podcasts and many many more. So if you're looking I mean so well to start your own podcast look no further than anchor that's right. Speaking of podcasts uh uh I mean right? Here's the happy hour. Frickin frickin Fricks. I slept until 9:00 today. Oh my well I mean uh God. Oh my God. I tried all we can to kind of maintain my uh um okay West Coast time.
