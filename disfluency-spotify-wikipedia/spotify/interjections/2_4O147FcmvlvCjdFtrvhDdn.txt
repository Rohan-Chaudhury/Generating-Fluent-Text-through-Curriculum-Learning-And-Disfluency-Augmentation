Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out so you know if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I so I mean reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew well you know Link in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation um so speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is you know okay officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So um like let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, I mean um but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of you know so this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming um okay this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all um I mean have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments like well below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But like so if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier so so today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check out uh well our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
