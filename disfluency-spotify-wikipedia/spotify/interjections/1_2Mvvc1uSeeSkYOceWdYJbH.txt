Okay, this has nothing to you know do with anything we've ever talked about Kaylee doesn't know about it because she just I mean happened to walk in and the very last episode. But anyways, I've been watching you know Love is Blind within the Pilar alert. Oh, yeah. I don't give a okay fuck. I'm mad. Anyways, me and my girlfriend had been watching it for the past um two days. We were up till like o'clock in the morning. I love Cameron uh and Lauren. I'm emotionally invested in the two of them. Hey, she just she just so spilled her drink her water everywhere. Anyways, I'm emotionally invested in Cameron well and Lauren. Although I do think Cameron. He gets a little bit whiny sometimes he's I mean a little he just he's very emotional. He's a very emotional man and but you know but he loves her very much. However today we made it to the last episode. We have not seen Cameron and Lauren's wedding yet, but.
