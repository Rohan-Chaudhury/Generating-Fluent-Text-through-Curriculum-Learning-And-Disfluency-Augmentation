Hello and welcome to vlogger History season 2 episode 2 My name is Ann foster. Okay uh. And this is a feminist women's history comedy podcast. I don't know why I like okay made there be so many words in explaining what it is, but I think I've like um explained it properly in every episode so far. So in season one, we were looking I mean I mean at women who who made history by quote unquote misbehaving which is sort so so of like also not Don't quote misbehaving because several of them did murder people uh so this season we're looking at women leaders and how men complained and were freaked out about it and how it's not so different from nowadays when.
