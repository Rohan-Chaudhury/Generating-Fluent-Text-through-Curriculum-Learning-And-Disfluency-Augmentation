Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the Gospel reading uh well uh like I mean well you know you know well like from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an exegesis of the literal well uh okay okay so um well I mean I mean you know sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter 5 verse so okay okay uh so um well well so like 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how it was said I mean okay you know you know well uh um well uh well you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say this to you I mean I mean uh uh like uh I mean uh so so love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in this like I mean so so okay you know uh so like like way. You will be sons of your father in Heaven for he causes his like I mean I mean well well so like you know well uh sun to rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
