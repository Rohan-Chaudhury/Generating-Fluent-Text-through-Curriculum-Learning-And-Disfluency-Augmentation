Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, well so like so like uh like you know I mean there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that okay well you know um well I mean okay I mean so the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us okay okay um you know well uh you know um okay in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit um you know I mean okay uh like like okay you know on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it uh so okay um okay okay um like I mean and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting um okay okay so uh I mean okay I mean um that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not um okay uh okay well I mean like I mean so supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh okay I mean so um so so well okay you know on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. Um okay I mean like well um like well like. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
