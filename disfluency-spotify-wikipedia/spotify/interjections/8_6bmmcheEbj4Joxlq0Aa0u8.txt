At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came like like I mean I mean um um okay uh over a Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six like you know well okay like so uh I mean feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on well so like so so okay like like the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice you know uh well uh uh I mean so well a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who well you know I mean um I mean like well uh lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Well like like um you know so um uh. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to well okay well um um I mean okay uh his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very you know well like uh you know uh well so strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner um okay you know I mean okay well I mean I mean of the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came you know well I mean so well well well well back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
