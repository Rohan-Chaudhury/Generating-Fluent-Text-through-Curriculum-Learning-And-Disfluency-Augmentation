I'm Jason, I'm Rosie. I'm Paula. I'm sin and this is thoughts and confessions. Yo yo like yo, what's up guys? What's up? What's up? So this week has been very interesting uh for me. I also like I've been dealing with some issues one can say towards like in terms of anger in terms of when people would say like Darkness. And just trying um to find the ways for me to be able to kind of marry uh that anger that I have inside with the positivity that I also have inside. We well all go through that I guess so how deep it does the rabbit hole you know go super deep Bro Whitey. Yeah, like it's something that like I sort of you know I think it started when I actually traveled to Trinidad this year. So I went through the Christmas.
