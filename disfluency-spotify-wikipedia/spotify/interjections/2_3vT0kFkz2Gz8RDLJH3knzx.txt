You are listening to do includes live podcast with a McMillan and Becky so okay Ward where we talk about doing your 20s in the 2020s. Hi guys. Thank I mean like you for joining us for our first ever episode of doing quarterly podcast. And okay so this week. We are celebrating women. I'll is international Women's Day on Sunday the 8th of like uh March, so we thought it'd be a good opening topic as two female podcast. Has Amy like um what could stuff have you heard in the news this week? Okay, so I well so know in a moment you're going to be talking about a really huge piece of okay okay news that was covered in the media last week. So I thought it might like I mean be nice for me to start with maybe a slightly smaller you story that people I mean uh haven't necessarily heard about and I was scrolling through Twitter last week and stumbled um you know across an article about hair salons and basically a number of salons across the UK have been boycotting gossip magazines.
