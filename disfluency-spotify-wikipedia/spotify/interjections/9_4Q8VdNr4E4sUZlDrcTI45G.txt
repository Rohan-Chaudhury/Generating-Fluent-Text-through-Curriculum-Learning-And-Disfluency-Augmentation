Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I okay so I mean okay I mean um so uh uh guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that so so you know so so you know I mean uh uh that I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a um you know okay so um like I mean um like little bit the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. Well well um so you know I mean okay I mean you know. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here okay you know so well uh you know like well okay towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 so you know well so like well so so I mean following it says this and the evening of that first day of the week you know well like like um like I mean okay I mean when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the jews. So you know uh uh okay I mean um um um. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you after he said this I mean um uh um you know I mean um like so he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
