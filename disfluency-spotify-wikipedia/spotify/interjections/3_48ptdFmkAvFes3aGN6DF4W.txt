Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be your okay you know I mean host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to renew well you know well the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse I mean like so is taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and greatest like okay I mean day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone um so okay who is thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation um you know like to come to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
