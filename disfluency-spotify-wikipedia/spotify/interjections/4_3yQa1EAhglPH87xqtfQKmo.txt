Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic okay I mean okay well of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This I mean like I mean so is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the you know like okay um reality is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to like I mean you know okay feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not um well well uh always going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to I mean like well so be really great and you're going to be full of passion and feel I mean uh well so inspired. And other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working well okay so you know out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in um like you know you know your ear and your life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or well okay so so that business you want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic I mean well you know so for you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
