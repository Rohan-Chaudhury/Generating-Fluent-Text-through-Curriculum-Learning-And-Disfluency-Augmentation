Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard you know um like towards Ascension. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I well like um am joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream like so like speakers in another episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I like you know um thought it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you um you know so doing. I am doing fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about I mean so so the woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours like so um just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where okay you know so they take it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two I mean well so hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that you know so well Australian summer time and North American summer time do not occur at the same time. Well you know you know. So I'm like, let's figure out a time to record what will be good and okay I mean uh I'm like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and um um you know like I can wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
