Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you so uh well uh well you know okay want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that I mean you know um um like so so Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link so well okay you know like um well in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie um so like you know uh well so was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire well like I mean like so I mean um Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie um like like like I mean okay uh was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she you know like you know well uh so uh has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie so well uh like uh uh uh would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no okay uh um well um uh um other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in okay you know like like you know like well the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But well well uh okay you know well so if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier so uh I mean you know well you know like today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor like like uh you know okay I mean uh after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV.
