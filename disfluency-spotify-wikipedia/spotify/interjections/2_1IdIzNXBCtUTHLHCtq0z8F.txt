Hey and welcome back. Hello, everybody. Hello? Hello? Hi Ryan. Hi Curtis. How are I mean uh you? I'm good. How are you? I'm so good. So so good. It's been it's been so okay a pretty eventful like week, I guess since we last recorded. Yeah, and we recorded I mean like this coming episode. This guests really really early. We did we did. This is you know um actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this little Snippets recorded after your uh you know episode. Halftime, so we actually did have our guests on a little bit earlier like you know this week. Yeah, when he was here because of the way that you know, uh I mean this Gus could make it around but you know, we're recording the intro after we record okay um the actual episode. Typically. We like to record the intro this this snippet part without well um the guest even being around. Yeah. So it just the way it works. So uh well usually we recorded before the guest shows up this last step the set this guess okay okay we didn't have time to yeah. But anyways, how was how was your week bit how how things been for you?.
