I know that I mean um like we fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country needs is a king. Oh um you know I mean my God now listen. Listen, I'm not saying we need a monarch with absolute power. I'm I mean um well not saying we need to go to some like Royal Dutch like diagnostic system. Well like you know. But look at England right now how much better would our political discourse be if so um um we would just elect the king for every like a decade every 10 years. You know like you know. Donald Trump gets to be king. But we have a like a boring-ass technocrat. Who's uh so okay They're as prime minister is actually making the decision, right? So he's have a guy who's a uh so um guy or a gal whose job is to go to NASCAR races and give uh uh okay speeches and set off. The first fireworks on the fourth of July. If you want to figure out is what I want a figure, how did.
