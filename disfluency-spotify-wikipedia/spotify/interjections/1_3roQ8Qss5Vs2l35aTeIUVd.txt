Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the well things well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me uh that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us like in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on um a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and uh dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. Like. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed well to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the okay couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them well to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
