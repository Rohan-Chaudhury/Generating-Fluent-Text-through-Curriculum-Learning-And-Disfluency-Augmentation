I have had some okay shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of so which is the fact that I have literally not had a job for the past. I mean. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like a gig here I mean and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my bank account. I well have not consistently been working and I think that's for a few reasons. One of well which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
