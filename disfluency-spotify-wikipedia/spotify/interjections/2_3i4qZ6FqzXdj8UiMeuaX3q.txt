Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm your host well well Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock central.com Kyle and Taylor here well uh to talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite impressive 12-point home victory over the um so Mississippi State Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have you know uh and they did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they I mean I mean got up big early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that lead well uh going into halftime and then by the second half things kind of evened out in um well South Carolina, they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 so okay and most of the time they were up by like six or something like uh well that but it felt comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single you know like spectacular performance but a lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and I mean well as much as we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
