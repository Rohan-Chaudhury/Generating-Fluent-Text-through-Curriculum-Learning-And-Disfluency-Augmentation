Due to the graphic consequences of today's disaster listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is I mean you know so I mean advised for listeners under 13 at 3 p.m. On August 20th, 1910 Forest ranger uh I mean uh so Ed Pulaski and a ragtag team of young volunteers were clearing brush on a well you know um I mean ridge above the town of Wallace, Idaho. It was a hot day but the okay um like I mean sun was obscured by smoke Pulaski and his Squad were on the front lines of um you know like okay an effort to combat. Thousands of small wild fires blazing along the northern reaches well like so uh of the Rocky Mountains for weeks. He and his comrades in the newly so I mean you know uh formed US Forest Service had relentlessly cleared swaths of forest to Halt the fires, they were uh you know uh like overworked and understaffed. But many members of the service still believe the situation was under well you know okay I mean control but Pulaski worried the worst was yet to come when smoke from the fires blocked out the sun around 3 p.m.
