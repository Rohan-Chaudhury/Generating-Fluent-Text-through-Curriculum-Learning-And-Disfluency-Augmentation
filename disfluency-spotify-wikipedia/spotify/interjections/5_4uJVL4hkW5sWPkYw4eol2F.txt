Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai um okay okay like um time major Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross you know okay you know well like rental yields in Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking I mean uh I mean okay okay about Parnell given that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it okay uh um um like is probably not likely an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Like well uh um so. Well a couple of weeks ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one um like you know you know I mean of the large banks in New Zealand and they said can you comment on um um okay well uh an article that we're writing for our website where they were showing by well I mean you know you know um the latest core logic data that the the median gross rental yield on a um well um you know so three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell like so okay like I mean the gross yield for that is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
