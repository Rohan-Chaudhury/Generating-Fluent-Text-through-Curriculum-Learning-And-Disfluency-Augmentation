Do we well have a special guest for you crystallinity from socks in the basement podcast. You I mean can follow them on Twitter at Chris Ludacris. What's going on? I appreciate you jumping well in with us to talk some White Sox baseball on the future Sox I mean podcast. This is going to be weird for me because I don't normally do well interviews. I normally interview other people. So I'm going to completely screw this up mike. You know. Appreciate you having me on the show. And yeah, we're excited over at Saks so in the basement right now where we've been doing this now for almost two well years and it really is like a Grassroots thing that I didn't expect to get you know as big as it's turned into and now we're you know, we got this well live event of cork and Kerry the park on the 28th, and we're going well to be trying out a live broadcast from there through the Pod be nap and we're well going to be going to two shows a week instead of one and it just it's just it's a fun ride and it's great that we're growing just as the team.
