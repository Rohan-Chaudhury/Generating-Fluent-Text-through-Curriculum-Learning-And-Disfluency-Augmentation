Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability like become so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a uh fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she so came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that so the World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with okay may do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea um of ableism and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied so as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very you know specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting I mean conversation. I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review uh And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
