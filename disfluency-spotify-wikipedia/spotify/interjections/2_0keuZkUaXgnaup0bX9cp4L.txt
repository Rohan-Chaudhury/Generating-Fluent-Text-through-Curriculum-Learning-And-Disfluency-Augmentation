Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become so taboo? well well So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a fitness influencer and also um you know a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she came to be well you know disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the World perhaps I mean uh disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do which like um might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea of ableism and um I mean how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as opposed to um you know those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. It was uh I mean so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting conversation. I really so I mean hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
