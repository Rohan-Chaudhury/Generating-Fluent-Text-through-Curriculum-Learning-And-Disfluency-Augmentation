Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are uh okay so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of so um the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due so uh to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker okay okay because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't like I mean care if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look I mean uh at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that um you know that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so so um happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on uh um a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
