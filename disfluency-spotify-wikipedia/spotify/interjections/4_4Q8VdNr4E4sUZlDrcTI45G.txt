Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. Well um like you know. I guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that uh I mean you know um that I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a like um okay so little bit the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. Like uh um okay. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here towards well so um like the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 following you know uh like so it says this and the evening of that first day of the week when the disciples okay I mean you know uh were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and well well I mean okay stood among them and said peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
