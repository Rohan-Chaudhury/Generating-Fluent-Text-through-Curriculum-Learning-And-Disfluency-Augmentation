And you know, okay so okay you know so okay well okay okay like thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have had when so you know well like uh so you know I mean like like we first started out this would have been way way easier and it's much easier. It like I mean uh so like I mean um well well okay is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far the easiest way um um so so like like okay um well okay to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. In one place so so I mean well okay okay so uh you know like like you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything you know you know uh uh well well like you know you know uh and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on your phone right there okay you know you know okay uh okay well uh okay well free.

You need to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if we um well like like so like well um you know okay didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy.
