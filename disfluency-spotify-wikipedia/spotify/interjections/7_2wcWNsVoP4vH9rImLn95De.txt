So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I like like so okay uh uh okay have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach um um you know okay so okay uh because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how um uh okay okay so like like hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into well you know you know you know um okay so this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I uh uh okay so like well well know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop and uh well uh you know so okay okay it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me so okay um um so uh well well very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so I mean um well um well so well powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
