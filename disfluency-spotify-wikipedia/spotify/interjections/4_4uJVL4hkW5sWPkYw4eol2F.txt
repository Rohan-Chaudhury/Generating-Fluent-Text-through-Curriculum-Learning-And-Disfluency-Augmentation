Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai time well you know um well major Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross um um like uh rental yields in Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking like so well uh about Parnell given that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it uh so you know well is probably not likely an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. I mean like like I mean. Well a couple of weeks ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the uh well well I mean large banks in New Zealand and they said can you comment on an article so I mean well um that we're writing for our website where they were showing by the latest core logic so um like I mean data that the the median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house well well um like and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross okay I mean okay well yield for that is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
