This is your everyday positivity here on Vale. Hello. I'm Kate Crocker. I hope you're well uh okay uh today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough? I had a moment this week okay uh like with my coach about accountability and I was really surprised. It's always really surprising when you know you know um you think I've got that bit sorted and I'm always really good at that and okay I mean like then someone asks you a question and you go always like that. I think so well well I'm good at that or the time actually good at that so I have so you know so been challenged this week and And it's hard. It's hard pushing yourself through those okay well okay challenges. It feels uncomfortable you get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and you your I mean you know like instinct says right. I need to move away from this. I don't want to go there um um well t harv Eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets easy when uh uh you know you do the hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard stuff. You know um so. So something is really challenging you at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
