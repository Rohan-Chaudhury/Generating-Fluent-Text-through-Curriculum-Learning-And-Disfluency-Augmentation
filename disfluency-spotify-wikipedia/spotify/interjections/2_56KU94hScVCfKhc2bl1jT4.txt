Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really um okay appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in so I mean this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something so you know we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk okay so about it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite uh okay unlike everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to well okay 9, which is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his well uh brother John and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There I mean like in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
