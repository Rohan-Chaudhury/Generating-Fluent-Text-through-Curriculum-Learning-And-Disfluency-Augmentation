Welcome to the hottest take my name is Chris Ryan. I am joined by Jason uh concepci√≥n Juliet Littman and David Shoemaker and David you have before. I know that we um fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country needs is a king. Okay. Oh my God now listen. Listen, I'm not saying we need a monarch with uh absolute power. I'm not saying we need to go to some like Royal Dutch okay like diagnostic system. But look at England right now how much better would our political discourse um be if we would just elect the king for every like a decade every 10 um years. Donald Trump gets to be king. But we have a like a you know boring-ass technocrat. Who's They're as prime minister is actually making the decision, right? So he's have well a guy who's a guy or a gal whose job is to go to NASCAR like races and give speeches and set off. The first fireworks on the fourth of you know July. If you want to figure out is what I want a figure, how did.
