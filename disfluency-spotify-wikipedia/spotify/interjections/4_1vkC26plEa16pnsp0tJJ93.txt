Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to leave okay you know like I mean fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this like well you know um on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to um like well you know digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going you know okay I mean okay to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And like you know like I mean I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you so well well so cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I like okay I mean okay mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're / so okay okay so like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view okay like uh so of a player but we did learn some things some players had much better showing than well okay okay okay others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
