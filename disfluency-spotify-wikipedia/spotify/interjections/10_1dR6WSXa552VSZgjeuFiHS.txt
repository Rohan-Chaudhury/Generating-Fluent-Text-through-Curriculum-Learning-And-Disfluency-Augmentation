Love um you know so uh well okay so I mean so uh Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much you know okay you know like okay I mean so so so you know money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life well okay you know so like uh like uh I mean um your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get well like you know you know uh well um uh so like so many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So okay like um I mean well okay you know so so so this is our time for us to be together and for me to answer like so well I mean like okay well well um uh your questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed um well like um well well like like I mean so relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than um you know so well uh okay uh um so well I am but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting so like um like well uh like you know uh okay their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
