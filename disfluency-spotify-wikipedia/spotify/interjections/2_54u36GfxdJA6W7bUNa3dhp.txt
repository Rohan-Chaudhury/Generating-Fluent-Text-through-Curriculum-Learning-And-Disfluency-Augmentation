Welcome ladies welcome. So I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat texting and um you know FaceTime. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I do a lot of uh uh live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some you know so of you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few like uh minutes and then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk so you know about first uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age okay I mean of 25 and that and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it uh uh for real. It's pushing it. I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
