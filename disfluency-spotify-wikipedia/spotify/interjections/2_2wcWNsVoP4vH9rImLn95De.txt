So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I like I mean have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because like so I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it you know I mean can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this so like pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I I mean well know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in um I mean a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something um you know to me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been you know you know so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
