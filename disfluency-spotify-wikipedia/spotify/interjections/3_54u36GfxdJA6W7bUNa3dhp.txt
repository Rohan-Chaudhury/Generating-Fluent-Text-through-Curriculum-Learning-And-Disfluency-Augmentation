Welcome ladies welcome. So I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat texting and okay well uh FaceTime. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I do a um okay okay lot of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some of so so like you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few minutes and then well okay um move on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk about first uncovered well uh so Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age of 25 and that and okay well like that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it for real. It's pushing it. I'm okay um so not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
