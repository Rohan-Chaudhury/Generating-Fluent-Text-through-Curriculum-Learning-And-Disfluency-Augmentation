Hi, welcome to you were taught that in school episode 1 taxes, everyone always writes um um like um after they get out of school about how they couldn't do their taxes and how like okay so um they wish school and taught them to do their taxes. And why didn't okay well so like somebody teach them do their taxes what you were taught that in school. It's so like I mean I mean called basic math in first grade or 2nd grade. They taught you how to I mean well um I mean add and subtract numbers. That's how you do taxes. You line them up in uh um I mean you know a column you add some together, you subtract some the Part about that is you like I mean uh so were taught how to follow directions. There's directions at the top of the okay uh I mean I mean paper. You were supposed to read them. You read those directions and you follow them. So you like okay I mean so were taught that in school that was in elementary school the fact that you know well like uh you can't follow directions and do simple math doesn't mean that you weren't taught that I mean like well like in school. It just means that you can't do simple math or follow directions. This has been you we're taught that in school episode 1. See you next week.
