Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release um um um uh so okay for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the you know you know like well um well choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to so like okay uh I mean like the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower when um well like um um I mean I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I just well well so I mean like um try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not even thinking um okay well I mean like so about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just filled music and so I mean well so um like what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all these like okay so you know um um musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to be or when uh well uh like like well it will be but it just happens after you listen to it for a while so like uh so I mean uh and then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the I mean I mean um well uh like choreography when those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in you know I mean um I mean uh so the music. So those little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
