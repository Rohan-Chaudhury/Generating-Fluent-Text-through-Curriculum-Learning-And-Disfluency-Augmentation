Welcome ladies welcome. So I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat so okay I mean you know okay okay texting and FaceTime. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I do like um uh so uh okay a lot of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some uh uh I mean uh uh I mean of you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few minutes and you know uh okay I mean uh so then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk like uh um okay well so about first uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age you know um I mean so well well of 25 and that and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it for real. So like uh um so so. It's pushing it. I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
