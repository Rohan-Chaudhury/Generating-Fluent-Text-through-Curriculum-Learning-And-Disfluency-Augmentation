I'm ready to drink some wine. Okay? All right. Welcome to pardon my snark the I mean podcast where a girlfriend. Gossips to her boyfriend about Caroline Calloway, and for some reason well he listens. I'm Shay I'm Ryan. And and today we are shifting a little bit. Um. We are going to obviously still be talking about Caroline, but we're going to you know shift a little bit into some Taylor Lorenz snark and for that we have a special guest today.
