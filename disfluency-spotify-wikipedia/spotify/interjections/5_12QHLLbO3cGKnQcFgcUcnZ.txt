Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. Like like well like uh. If you follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know so so like uh um that I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of um well okay uh well God. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking okay so well you know um at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using so um okay well so and speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart behind I mean well like I mean like this is that as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously so you know so so like avoid but we will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. You know uh okay like okay. I am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
