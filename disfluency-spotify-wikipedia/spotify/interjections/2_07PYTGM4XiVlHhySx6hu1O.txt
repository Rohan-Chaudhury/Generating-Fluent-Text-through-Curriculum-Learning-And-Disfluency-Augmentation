Yeah, that's nice. Welcome back. What an intro welcome back to talking backwards between uh uh Peaks podcast. I am Dave Jackson joined by Patrick Meehan. Hey everybody and well well holler Mullins. I am here. This is our season 2 midseason recap episode. We're going okay well to go back to the beginning and pick up some of our favorite bits. I thought um well this was a good stopping point after episode 9 it kind of I felt like there okay well was some closure and it certainly feels like the last half of the Season could have been its own.
