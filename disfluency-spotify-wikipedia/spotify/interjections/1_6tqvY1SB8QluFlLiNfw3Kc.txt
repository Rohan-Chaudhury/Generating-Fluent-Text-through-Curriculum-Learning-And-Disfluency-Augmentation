Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the okay fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place you know of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due I mean to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker uh because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't okay care if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you well look at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the okay fact that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me okay so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second I mean half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
