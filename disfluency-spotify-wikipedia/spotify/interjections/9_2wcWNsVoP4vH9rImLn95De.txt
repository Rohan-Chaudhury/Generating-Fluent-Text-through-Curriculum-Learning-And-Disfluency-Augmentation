So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, um uh um like like well um you know you know I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because uh uh I mean uh I mean so uh um okay I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it so um uh you know well well you know well like can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this uh you know um I mean so um uh uh I mean pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which um I mean uh so you know okay you know okay I mean I know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a uh I mean well okay so um well so like loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to uh you know I mean um you know I mean uh so uh me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then okay I mean I mean you know I mean you know uh um uh has been so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with so um you know uh so so well well like you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
