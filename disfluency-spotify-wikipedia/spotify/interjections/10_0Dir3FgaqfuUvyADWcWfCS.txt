Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for um well um um well like so you know um uh our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old school like um uh um uh okay I mean so I mean like one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one um you know you know well uh uh uh okay so uh of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she well uh you know so okay okay so okay so well saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when well okay okay okay uh so um like I mean like I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence so I mean like uh uh well like so I mean um seems wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that okay um okay uh okay you know so uh um like so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
