Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be your host you know you know so well I mean you know for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to renew well well okay like well well the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse is taken you know okay uh uh uh uh from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and greatest day okay so like uh like so of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who so you know I mean I mean um uh is thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation to come like um like I mean uh well to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
