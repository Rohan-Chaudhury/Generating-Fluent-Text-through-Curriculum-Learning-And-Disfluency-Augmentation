Well, I think this is like episode 56 so you know or something. Maybe it maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers out there well okay to correct us, you know, occasionally we do say things that are okay well not correct often speak for yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the like so show, but that just has because we do is almost zero prep. We just uh um kind of come from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think um well most of the time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from someplace uh um else. Never glad.
