Hi, welcome to you were taught that in school episode 1 taxes, everyone always okay uh I mean writes after they get out of school about how they couldn't do like like um their taxes and how they wish school and taught them to do their you know um okay taxes. And why didn't somebody teach them do their taxes what you were okay like so taught that in school. It's called basic math in first grade or 2nd grade. They taught uh I mean I mean you how to add and subtract numbers. That's how you do taxes. You line them up well okay uh in a column you add some together, you subtract some the Part about that is well uh you know you were taught how to follow directions. There's directions at the top of the paper. You you know you know like were supposed to read them. You read those directions and you follow them. So okay so well you were taught that in school that was in elementary school the fact that I mean uh okay you can't follow directions and do simple math doesn't mean that you weren't taught that I mean uh you know in school. It just means that you can't do simple math or follow directions. I mean I mean you know. This has been you we're taught that in school episode 1. See you next week.
