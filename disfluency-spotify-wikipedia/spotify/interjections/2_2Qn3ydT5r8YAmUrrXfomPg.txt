Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host every well well night and I'm answering the phone today on the show. We're going to uh so be talking about 2/3 Capital maintenance. Now, you're probably thinking what the hell is deferred so well Capital maintenance and what it is is it is the situation where if you buy an I mean well existing property you buy it today and then in 10 years it requires a well so new row for Is significant expense on the hot water? It's cylinder. It requires you know uh significant expense or rewiring the house and we know that this happens it's not something okay okay we necessarily budget for in our day-to-day expenses, but it's something that needs to happen if um you know every couple of months, so I not months every couple of decades and this is actually um um a concept that has been brought to our attention and is often promoted by Matthew Gilligan from Gilligan drone Associates, very very intelligent.
