Ain't there was a time when I wasn't aware of like okay okay uh you know the differences that came from growing up between worlds and of the push and like I mean okay I mean uh pull of the happy and the hard then I went to a school for you know um well like okay missionaries kids in Germany when I was in ninth grade, and I quickly came to you know I mean like okay okay realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite been able to put a finger you know like uh um I mean on we're not just in me my friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
