You should strive to do both like and um okay so I mean he just didn't agree with it which was but he reached out to me and show me okay well like uh a DM and I do what I typically do when I hit him with an uh you know so okay audio message and explain my position and you know next thing, you know, we're back you know um so I mean and forth with a few audio messages and the guy, you know, we're we went from adversarial to you know, I probably go get a beer the.
