Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope you okay okay okay so guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode starts. Um um um so. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this podcast like I mean well so is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought well uh okay so you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you well uh well you know know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I okay well so okay recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what uh uh like okay the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a um so you know okay lot of the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental like uh uh I mean health growing up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a well like well you know young adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will uh so um I mean be basically growing up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast well you know uh I mean should be. So basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast okay I mean you know you know and basically having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
