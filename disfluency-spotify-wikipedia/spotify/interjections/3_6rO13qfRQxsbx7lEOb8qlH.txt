Are you going to love this one? I put out so much content that if okay I mean I mean you listen to my stuff for free every single day if you listen to well uh um one of my pieces of content, there's over 10 years worth of content. There's over okay like so tick like you can listen to me once a day for 10 straight years and well well I mean not have to pay nothing. But guess what happened in those 10 years Cam well um you know Newton start listening to me and middle school and high school. Then he went to well so well Auburn and told the coach to come get me. Then he went to um like so the pros and told the coach. I got to speak after all these kids so you know well in the hood who didn't have fathers. I became their father on Instagram. So when uh like you know they went to the NBA they Daddy with him when I went to the nfl. Like you know uh. They took their daddy with them when they became preachers and start a um um so church when they became CEOs or execs at companies when they look for a trainer it wasn't that I was.
