Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm well well interviewing had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he okay so do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, it's so so very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl I mean so duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing well well gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be in three meetings at well I mean once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have ways of getting so like around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
