Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the uh I mean okay I mean well topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I got like okay well I mean so an email here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for is probably I mean okay so I mean okay since late last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been coaching him you know like like you know uh now. Well maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got a okay so you know you know like couple of situations that he's asking me about so he basically he meets so you know um so uh his All at a concert and I guess his group and her group of friends uh well so you know you know kind of emerged at some point, and she listened this. She says that uh I mean like well you know she told him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
