Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or try to um so you know create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going I mean um I mean on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast is well like you know to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being real okay like like being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the okay okay um opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to grow okay I mean okay through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder that okay you know well in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when our backs are up uh uh well against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
