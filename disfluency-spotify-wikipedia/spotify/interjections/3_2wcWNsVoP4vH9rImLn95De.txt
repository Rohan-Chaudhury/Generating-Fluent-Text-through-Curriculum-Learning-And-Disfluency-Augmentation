So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, uh um well I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach like well uh because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard um okay like it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this okay okay um pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I you know so um know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop and okay well um it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me so very uh I mean um profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so powerful so well uh that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
