They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that habit uh um well you know I mean of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And so okay. So uh uh like um uh what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels and we want I mean okay um like okay to remind you that that there is a stream of well-being which you are well I mean I mean well um allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason are um um well uh I mean standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that stream of so I mean okay like I mean well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so you is well um you know okay um so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
