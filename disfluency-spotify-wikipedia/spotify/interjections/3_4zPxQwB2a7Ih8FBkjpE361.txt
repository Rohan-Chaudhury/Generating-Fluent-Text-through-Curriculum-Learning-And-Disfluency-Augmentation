Due to the graphic consequences of today's disaster listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is okay I mean you know advised for listeners under 13 at 3 p.m. On August 20th, 1910 Forest ranger I mean like you know Ed Pulaski and a ragtag team of young volunteers were clearing brush on a ridge like uh so above the town of Wallace, Idaho. It was a hot day but the sun was obscured I mean um like by smoke Pulaski and his Squad were on the front lines of an effort to so so well combat. Thousands of small wild fires blazing along the northern reaches of the Rocky Mountains for weeks. So um like. He and his comrades in the newly formed US Forest Service had relentlessly cleared swaths of well uh okay forest to Halt the fires, they were overworked and understaffed. But many members of the you know well you know service still believe the situation was under control but Pulaski worried the worst was yet to come when smoke from the fires blocked out the sun around 3 p.m.
