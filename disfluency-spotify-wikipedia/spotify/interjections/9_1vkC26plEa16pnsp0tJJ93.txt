Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to leave fantasy so like um uh so so you know um um Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on Monday morning. So um I mean you know well I mean you know well I mean um at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest some you know um so like well I mean well uh well of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to talk okay you know so well um um uh well you know about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I know you know um like um um uh um well okay I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot freak um so okay okay okay you know um so well out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. Well you know well I mean like um you know well so. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're uh well well I mean uh I mean well uh so / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view I mean you know I mean you know so okay you know so I mean of a player but we did learn some things some players had much okay I mean I mean I mean I mean like um I mean well better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
