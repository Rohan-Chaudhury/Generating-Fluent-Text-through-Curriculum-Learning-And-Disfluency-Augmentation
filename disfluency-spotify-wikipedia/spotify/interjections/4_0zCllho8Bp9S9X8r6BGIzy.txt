I actually I actually didn't have the mic in my hand. So. I got uh well uh uh a fat callus on my hand right now. Sorry, I like sandpaper. It's all uh I mean like you know right. But yeah, so sorry about that long break we took we were just um I mean like like really busy with midterms papers. We went on a Hiatus we just were busy. I mean well so you know. Yeah. Sorry, not a Hiatus. That means we're like temporarily broken up. It's a short break. Okay spotty spotty neck.
