Hey dedicated listener to The Machinist therapy hotline, as you can imagine when we are uh um recording our podcast. We have hours of audio that we have to sift through okay okay more often than not the level of conversation is at such a high intellectual well well point that we're not sure if it really can get into the podcast. Okay so. We thought we might share one of them with you now, but remember if you want so uh to be involved, don't forget. You send us a DM. Send us your questions like well and we'll go from there. We hope you enjoyed today's episode. Thanks. I did I did uh so the whole sort of winning the Florida when the Clear Water went down. I um uh did like did Miami and then sort of come back round again and went into uh um they had one of those what's it called the like the Everglades stole fan boat thingies, whatever. Yeah, and.
