Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really appreciate um okay you know so um your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this um like um you know you know way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we don't often uh well so uh okay talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about it you know so okay so so more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. Uh I mean well I mean so. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is um like so I mean you know the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led okay uh you know I mean um them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he uh you know you know uh okay was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
