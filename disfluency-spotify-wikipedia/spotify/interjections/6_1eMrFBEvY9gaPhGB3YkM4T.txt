Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very okay okay okay um like okay traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of my eyes. Uh you know you know well okay uh. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, it was so well okay well okay uh so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on the like um I mean like uh uh table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I uh um well so I mean so also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It you know I mean um um like okay didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first uh so uh uh I mean well thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral I mean so I mean like um like vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
