You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television um okay I mean and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to I mean uh so work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an uh uh um hour a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors uh so um writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. Like I mean you know. On the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's I mean okay um color but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a you know I mean I mean glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about I mean um I mean color from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
