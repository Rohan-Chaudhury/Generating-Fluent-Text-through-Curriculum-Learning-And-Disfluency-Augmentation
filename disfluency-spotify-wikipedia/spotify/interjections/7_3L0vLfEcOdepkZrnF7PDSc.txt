I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to like uh okay um well well you know New Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a I mean well okay um okay um um lot of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after I mean um well uh you know so you know but I had so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to well um you know okay like well um go get my pap. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people okay well like um uh I mean so that I see in a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then okay you know uh so I mean like so I'm staying in New Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's um so uh well I mean so like over here and nephews and it be loud like I'm finally recording because now um okay so like uh so okay I'm finally in my house and no one's here right now, which is kind of um well I mean you know uh I mean so rare. So I'm trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
