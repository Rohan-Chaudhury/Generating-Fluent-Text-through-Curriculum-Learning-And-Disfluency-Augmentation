Hello and welcome to vlogger History season 2 episode 2 My name is Ann well Foster. And this is a feminist women's history comedy podcast. I don't know uh why I made there be so many words in explaining what it is, but I think okay I've explained it properly in every episode so far. So in season one, we were um looking at women who who made history by quote unquote misbehaving which is sort of like um also not Don't quote misbehaving because several of them did murder people I mean this season we're looking at women leaders and how men complained and were freaked out about it and how it's not so different from nowadays when.
