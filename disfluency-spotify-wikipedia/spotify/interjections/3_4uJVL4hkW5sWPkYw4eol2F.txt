Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed like so okay Makai time major Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross so I mean so rental yields in Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking about Parnell like I mean okay given that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably okay you know well not likely an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well I mean okay um a couple of weeks ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the okay like okay large banks in New Zealand and they said can you comment on an article so you know um that we're writing for our website where they were showing by the latest core logic um okay well data that the the median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and like like okay Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross yield well you know like for that is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
