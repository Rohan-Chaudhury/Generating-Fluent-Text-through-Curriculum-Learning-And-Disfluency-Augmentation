Hello everyone and welcome to the defining time show on V wrist radio. We're up to episode 17 which has been a lot of fun and we're certainly getting through these episodes but we get to meet and interact with a lot of different people. And today I have another very special guest who goes by the Instagram handle of grand obsessions Irwin. How you going? I'm good, mate. Thank you for having me. No worries at all. It's it's a pleasure. Come and talk to us. What a pleasure for me. Sorry, but today we got a really special show around really.
