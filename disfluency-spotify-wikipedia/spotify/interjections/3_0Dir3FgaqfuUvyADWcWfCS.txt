Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So like okay um for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the okay well well original old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was like um I mean one of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones okay um well she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was I mean okay like about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. You know well you know. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so I mean you know you know before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
