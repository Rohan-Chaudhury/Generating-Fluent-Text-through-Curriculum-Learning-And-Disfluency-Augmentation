Hello, you lovely bunch and welcome back to yes, another episode of the vitalife show like uh so me Tori and Me Myself and Irene. I have nobody on this podcast and like I mean you know there's a good reason for it. I also just want to say if the sound you know you know well quality sound slightly different. I do apologize. I haven't got my headphones and that well well like is because I am currently in the middle of moving so I have packed like well uh my whole life up not thinking that I needed me. Fines and I'm in okay so um the middle of a hotel because I also started a new job last week. And yeah, well so like it's all decided to come at once. But the reason I actually chose to do this I mean so like podcast and do this by myself is because it's something that I want to talk to so okay you know you about just from my own personal experience for once to a uh well um perfectly honest, obviously with being mental health months and the last couple of episodes to kind of touching on Mental Health.
