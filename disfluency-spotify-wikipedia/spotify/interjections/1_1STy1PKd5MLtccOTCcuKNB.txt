And now here's your like host Aaron Richard. Hi everybody Welcome to a brand new episode of fun I mean to speculate. I'm your host Aaron Richard and sitting next to me is like producer Vlad. Hi guys. I'm back. Well, yes you were sick last for the last episode. That's uh right. Yeah, because in the grand scheme of things we recorded it's actually been a so while since we like sat here to do and episode 2 because we recorded so well many episodes in like a three-day time span and we had a nice little break um in between and now we have to catch up and record one like every week you know or schedule another week of insanity. That's okay though. I love this show. Okay. I love this show. I want this show. I hope everyone in the world listens to um that's a little bit extreme, but, you know, I hope a lot of people I mean enjoy it. I hope we keep the topics coming in good thought-provoking ways, and I just hope we always keep it entertaining for you. So, thank you.
