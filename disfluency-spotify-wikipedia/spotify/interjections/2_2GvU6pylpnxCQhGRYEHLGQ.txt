Welcome to the March 3rd 2020 edition of coronavirus questions answered with dr. Brian McDonough. Here's uh I mean where we are at this very moment. We know that in the United States the um you know death toll has climbed to 9 in addition. We know that those cases are based so I mean in Washington state at a nursing home in Seattle. Most have occurred. The number of infections um uh in the United States overall have climbed past a hundred. They're scattered across 15. You know you know. It's with 27 cases in Washington state alone. As I mentioned that states getting hit very so uh hard, but it's not the only one the nursing home outbreak apparently seated the um well first case in North Carolina and Wake County resident who had visited the um well Washington State nursing home tested positive but is in isolation at home and doing well. So, where are we now what's going on?.
