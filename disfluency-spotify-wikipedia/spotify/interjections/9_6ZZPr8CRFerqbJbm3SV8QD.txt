Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting you know um so um well okay I mean so well as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You know you know you know um um you know well so well. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and like so like okay so so like I mean uh you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making love my uh uh so okay so so well well I mean breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath of Life um I mean well I mean you know so well so so kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher than the so well I mean so um I mean well uh I mean mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
