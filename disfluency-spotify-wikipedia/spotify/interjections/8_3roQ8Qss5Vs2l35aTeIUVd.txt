Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, there's so okay so like okay okay so uh many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the um you know um um like you know uh like kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six like I mean um like like like okay you know of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to um uh I mean um so um well like sit on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump um you know uh uh you know you know um so on it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on okay I mean uh I mean uh um um well it. It's for sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they like okay so you know um like like um know they're not supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little skipper. You know like I mean uh like uh um um. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo so well well I mean okay you know uh like it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
