Hello, everyone. Dr. Davidson Edmund. I hope everybody's doing very well and staying healthy. I mean. Today we're going to talk about their coronavirus. But first of all, I'd like like to introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm a board like certified Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see you about 40 okay 50 patients a day and the office I'll still go to the hospital and usually uh have a census. It's been 5 to 15 patients, including ICU and critical heal like patients. So literally my patients have been very worried about the core virus and to okay be honest who is not been worried about this. Okay? And therefore I've uh had multiple questions regarding, you know, what what what they can do to protect.
