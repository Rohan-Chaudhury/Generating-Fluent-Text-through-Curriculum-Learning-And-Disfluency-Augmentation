Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if um uh well like you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I you know um okay uh reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a I mean okay uh I mean production crew Link in the description and I along with almost all of uh you know so um Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that like you know uh you know theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. I mean well well um. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production uh I mean uh okay wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, like you know I mean you know right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But like well um okay as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Well you know um okay. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got um uh you know um for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just like okay I mean well did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out on this well you know I mean uh channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at um you know I mean so 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV.
