Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the uh you know um Gospel reading from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an well well so exegesis of the literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew uh uh I mean chapter 5 verse 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned um I mean well how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But uh you know like I say this to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you like well so in this way. You will be sons of your father in Heaven for he I mean well well causes his sun to rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
