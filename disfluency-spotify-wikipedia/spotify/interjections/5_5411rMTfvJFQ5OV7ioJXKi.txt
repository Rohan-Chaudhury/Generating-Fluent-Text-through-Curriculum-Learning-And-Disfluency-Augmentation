Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on the John I mean you know I mean like like Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty seven you know you know okay uh well cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the United states. Uh I mean well uh well. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 cases confirmed well I mean uh well okay with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we haven't had uh like so well I mean any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
