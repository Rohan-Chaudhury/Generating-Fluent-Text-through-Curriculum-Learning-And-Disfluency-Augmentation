Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree and I okay well became good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal State Long well like Beach Bree was actually taken the course because she was preparing to apply to okay well occupational therapy school. She has recently been admitted and we are so proud of her Bree okay I mean also has a background in kinesiology, which is what she studied for her undergraduate major um okay and when she was still studying that she also played basketball NCAA Division II at okay I mean Cal State East Bay. So this woman has a lot of knowledge about okay you know not only how to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. We're going to um uh dive into some of the ways in which she's faced some really tough situations um like and she's had to pull out that inner strength to keep going in the I mean uh face of some situations where she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
