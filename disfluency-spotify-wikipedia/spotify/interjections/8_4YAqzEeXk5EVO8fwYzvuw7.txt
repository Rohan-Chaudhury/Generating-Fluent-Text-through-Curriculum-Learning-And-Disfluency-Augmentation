Thank you guys so much for tuning in well like like like I mean you know uh uh in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why when and okay I mean so um uh okay um I mean how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to me, let me okay I mean uh so you know okay um uh at least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about I mean okay like you know okay so well like 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a okay so okay so uh well I mean uh nursing home from there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting uh okay um uh like like like uh working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice um well so well like uh you know so World, which is really where I wanted to be I was able to well well I mean well you know I mean like you know sit with people for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had I mean okay well um um you know um I mean follow-ups and we were able to see each other for a bit more than five okay so uh I mean like uh okay okay or ten minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in you know uh um you know so I mean you know uh a couple minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because okay uh so you know like like like so they've been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
