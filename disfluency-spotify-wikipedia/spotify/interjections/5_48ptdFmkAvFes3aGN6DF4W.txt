My name is Michael and I will be your host well I mean okay well well for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to renew okay um uh well you know the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse is taken I mean like um so you know from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and greatest okay uh you know well you know day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who is well I mean you know uh you know thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation to come well I mean like I mean like to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
