Hi everyone. Welcome back to skincare Somali A's your favorite bi-weekly skincare podcast. You know. I'm Natalie and I'm Jessica this week. We are talking about what we I I mean like to call the great exfoliation debate because we've got two different points of view and we're I mean going to Duke it out. Mano a mano this week. We will also okay of course do our wine pairing because we are your Somali A's and this week you know we're going with something a little bit more aggressive a little bit Bolder just okay like exfoliation. I would like to recommend Santa Julia winemakers Reserve Mountain blend. That is a Malbec and cab Franc blend from 2016. It's just a little bit.
