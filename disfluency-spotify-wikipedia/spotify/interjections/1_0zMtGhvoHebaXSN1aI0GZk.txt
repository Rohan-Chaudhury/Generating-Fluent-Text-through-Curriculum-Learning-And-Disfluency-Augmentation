It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a like small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living okay cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if like blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on okay osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as well blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high I mean concentration. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high uh the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle I mean tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as like a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this um process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
