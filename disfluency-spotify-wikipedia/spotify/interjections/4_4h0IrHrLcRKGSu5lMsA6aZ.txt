extraordinary women the podcast presenting extraordinary stories by ordinary women from Munich So I'm procedure like I mean um like right? I am South African and I've been living in Munich for almost seven and you know um like you know a half years and I'm currently an energy therapist but most of my focus goes I mean so like I mean into a trauma Survivor community that I started just over a year ago. It um uh like uh was really interesting because I grew up under the time of Apartheid. And so I like I mean uh I mean grew up thinking that how I lived was normal. I remember hearing Nelson Mandela's name for the first time when I was 9 years old.
