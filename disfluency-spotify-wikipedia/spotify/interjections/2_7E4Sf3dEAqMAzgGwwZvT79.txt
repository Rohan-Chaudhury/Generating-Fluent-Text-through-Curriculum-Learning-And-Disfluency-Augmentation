Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the I mean like topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I like I mean got an email here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for okay you know is probably since late last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've you know uh been coaching him now. Well maybe longer so he sent me this email and I mean you know he's got a couple of situations that he's asking me about so he basically I mean so he meets his All at a concert and I guess his group and well so her group of friends kind of emerged at some point, and she listened this. She well like says that she told him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
