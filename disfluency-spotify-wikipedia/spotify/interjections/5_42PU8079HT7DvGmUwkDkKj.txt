Good morning, everyone Welcome to our Friday spending time with Jesus podcast today. I uh uh I mean uh um wanted us to look at Romans chapter 1 the entire book of Romans is jam-packed you know like um like so with Theology and interesting thoughts and just like amazing Epic. Ders that people I mean I mean well uh I mean quote all the time and Romans chapter 1 is really no different and Romans 1 we're um okay I mean you know like dealing with our sexuality. We're dealing with idolatry. We're dealing with the question I mean so okay uh uh of is the law of God really written on the human heart no matter where okay well you know I mean um they're at. No matter where they've grown up or what they've heard all okay you know um um um their lives and it's an incredible chapter it lists out all the ways that we can so like like you know so act basically in sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that.
