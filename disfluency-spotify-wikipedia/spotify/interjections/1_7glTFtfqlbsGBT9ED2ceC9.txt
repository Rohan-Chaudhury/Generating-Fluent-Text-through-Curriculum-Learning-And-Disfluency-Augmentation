Hi and welcome to the fort down podcast. I'm Ben. I'm so and we're well here to talk about American football. So I go into the NFL after the demo for Madden um 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one with Drew um Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and the AFC Championship so Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This was um the game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you well play that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much why you you know chose to be a broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a Broncos fan because well quite um frankly because I have a horse and I went and I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
