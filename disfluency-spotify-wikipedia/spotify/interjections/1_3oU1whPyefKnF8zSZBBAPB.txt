I am complete in him who is the head of all principality uh and power. I am alive in Christ. I am free from the law of sin well and death. I am far from oppression and the enemy cannot come near me. I mean. I am born of God and the evil one cannot touch me. I Am Without Blame okay before him in love. Love I am in right standing with the father. I have like the mind of Christ. I have the peace of God that surpasses you know all understanding greater is he that is in me than he that is in I mean the world. I have received the power of the Holy Spirit. I have put up the uh old and put on the new I have been given and it's been given like to me. I have no lack for my God shall supply all my needs. You know. According to his riches. I have been called out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light of the Gospel.
