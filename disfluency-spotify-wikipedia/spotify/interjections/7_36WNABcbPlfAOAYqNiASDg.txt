If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our I mean like you know so okay like uh show notes in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened uh so so okay so uh um it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you okay like you know you know okay like um saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you uh okay um so okay like I mean kind of have that habit of of of telling us all is okay so you know I mean okay um um well and your own words. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is like uh okay well so like uh are there good angels and bad angels and we want to remind you that you know I mean like uh so like okay that there is a stream of well-being which you are allowing or not. And like okay um like like well so what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason are standing in a place like okay uh uh um okay well where they are not allowing their alignment with that stream of well-being because I mean I mean okay um um like like not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so you is so well I mean so like well uh okay painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
