this episode of the ortho bullets podcast will go over the topic of pediatric elbow dislocation so I mean from the Pediatric section on Ortho bullets.com pediatric elbow dislocations usually occur in older so um children defined as between 10 to 15 years old and can be associated with well uh other elbow fractures including a medial epicondyle fracture with an incarcerated intra-articular bone fragment you know I mean treatment is usually closed reduction followed by brief immobilization unless the medial epicondyle has an serrated well so fragment in the joint that is blocking reduction pediatric elbow dislocations, make up well like three to six percent of all pediatric elbow injuries. The male to female ratio like uh is 3 2 1 these injuries are most common in 10 to 15 year olds. And you know okay these are very rare in younger children less than three years old the mechanism you know okay of a pediatric elbow dislocation is typically a fall onto an outstretched hand so so as far as the path of anatomy elbow dislocations can be secondary to a posterior dislocation.
