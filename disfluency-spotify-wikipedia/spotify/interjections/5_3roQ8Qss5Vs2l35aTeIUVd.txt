Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things like um well okay I mean well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the uh like okay well so kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in this like you know like you know um household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch uh like um you know like not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance I mean so I mean um uh on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's you know you know uh I mean you know it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed okay uh like like so to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on so well okay well okay the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll so okay uh so well tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
