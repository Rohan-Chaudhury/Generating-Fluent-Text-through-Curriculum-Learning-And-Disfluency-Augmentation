The men of Lewis uh okay uh you know okay like like and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks of the Missouri like I mean okay I mean uh uh like River. It was a welcome respite after a long day of traveling the sleeping so so like uh I mean so like men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in their midst. Okay like okay so you know so you know. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured by bison well like uh I mean well well so meat that had been hung up to dry.
