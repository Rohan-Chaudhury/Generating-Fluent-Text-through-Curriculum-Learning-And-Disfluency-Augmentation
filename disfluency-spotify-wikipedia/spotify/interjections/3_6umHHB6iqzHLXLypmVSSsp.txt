Ain't there was so you know so a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that came from growing so uh um up between worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and you know okay like the hard then I went to a school for missionaries kids in Germany when like so you know I was in ninth grade, and I quickly came to realize that so I mean so those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite been able to put a finger on we're you know um like not just in me my friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
