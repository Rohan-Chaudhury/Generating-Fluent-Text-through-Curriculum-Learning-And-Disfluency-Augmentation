Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking to um well you know well you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology and health like okay okay well because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you have in you know so so I mean your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional life okay um like okay spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many questions so well I mean I mean from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is um so okay okay our time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. Like so so you know. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship like like well um for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I well well so okay am but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and well okay I mean like starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
