Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as so um you know well I mean you know we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You come well so you know you know like okay and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and you um you know um uh well like fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making love you know okay I mean so so so my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath of Life kissing so okay you know like uh uh my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher than the um well so uh like um mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
