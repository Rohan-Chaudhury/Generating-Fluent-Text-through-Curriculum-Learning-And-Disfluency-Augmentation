July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year old um came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez over dinner. I mean. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over San Jose the I mean largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it seemed after okay dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just like most okay nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The drugs okay burned hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to um hallucinate and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
