I'm like so um like you know going to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's uh well I mean um well see here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to I mean like um so like believe that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of that kind well uh um um I mean of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. She's since I mean uh um um uh moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a while, but it was I mean okay I mean like so really great to record this episode. She has spent the last several years so um like okay well studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I met her and she uh um like okay um has spent all these years doing that. So she's going to share some of uh I mean I mean um well her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have to so so uh you know you know apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I need to do before so uh so um like I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
