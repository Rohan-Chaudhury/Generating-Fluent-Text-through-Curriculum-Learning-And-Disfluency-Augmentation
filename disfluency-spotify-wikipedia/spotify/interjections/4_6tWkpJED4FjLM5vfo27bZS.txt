The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay okay well like uh emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her um well so I mean reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully um well okay so but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit you know uh so uh passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its so uh you know like cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username you know so um um saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the I mean so uh so show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners I mean okay um uh are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The show so you know well well is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You so like okay so can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season there will be like um uh like multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
