His first child was about to be born as he I mean like well like rushed past the Windows. He heard the crack of thunder and a deluge of rain spattering so like well you know against the glass. He stopped in his tracks the weather reminding him of a prophecy. He'd um uh like like heard years before if you do. Do this evil thing you shall have an evil I mean like like so son your nation shall become prey to Terrors and tears rivers of blood will flow. Like so okay well. The heads of the mighty will fall your cities will be devoured by Flames. He shook I mean you know so you know his head. He couldn't think about those words now his sin had already been committed like well well well now, he must be beside his wife in greet his child in the midst of the Wind and Rain.
