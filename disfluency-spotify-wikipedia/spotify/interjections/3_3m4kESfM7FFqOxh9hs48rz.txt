Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree and I became so I mean okay good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal State Long Beach like okay well Bree was actually taken the course because she was preparing to apply to occupational I mean okay I mean therapy school. She has recently been admitted and we are so proud of her um you know uh Bree also has a background in kinesiology, which is what she studied for her undergraduate major I mean uh you know and when she was still studying that she also played basketball NCAA Division II at well okay well Cal State East Bay. So this woman has a lot of knowledge about not only uh I mean um how to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. We're going to dive into some you know you know well of the ways in which she's faced some really tough situations and she's had you know so um to pull out that inner strength to keep going in the face of some situations where well so you know she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
