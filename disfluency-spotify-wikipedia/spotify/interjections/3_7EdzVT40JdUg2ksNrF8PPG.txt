Welcome to the lair a podcast. This podcast is in conjunction with the layer Aid conference so um so which is happening for the third year on Saturday, June 6th, 2020 in Providence, Rhode so uh I mean Island. The layer a conference is the first one to solely focus on social engineering okay well so and open source intelligence or osint gathering social engineers and osint investigators always um I mean uh seemed to have a great story. Re and you can hear many of those stories okay well well through their presentations at the conference, but not every story can fill a whole presentation um like I mean and not all storytellers can get to the conference which brings us here.
