So the time is probably going to come when I delete all these episodes right? I well you know uh think so. I don't want to just let it sit here if I'm not using um you know you know it, but what's happening today why I'm talking to you today is because it's warm out. Like well um. I think it's in the 50s to me. This is warm when outside was okay so okay still wearing a light down coat. Had all my stuff with me as most um uh so New Yorkers do we're always carrying stuff. Just taking out the trash. Too warm All right. Okay like so. Someone's actually letting me cross. I'm shocked. Thank you. Almost got killed by someone before crossing well like um the street. Thank you for being polite. So I was too hot. I came downstairs light down coat scarf in my bag too hot went back up put.
