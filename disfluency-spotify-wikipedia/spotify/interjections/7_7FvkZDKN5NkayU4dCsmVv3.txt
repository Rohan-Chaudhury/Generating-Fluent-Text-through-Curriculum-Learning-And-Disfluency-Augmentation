You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television okay uh okay okay well like I mean and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work I mean um uh uh I mean you know um on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a so I mean I mean okay I mean uh well day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors I mean you know you know well you know like so writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On well uh uh like I mean so you know the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but um I mean so um you know so um not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse okay okay so you know okay well I mean behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from time to I mean uh well well uh um okay time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
