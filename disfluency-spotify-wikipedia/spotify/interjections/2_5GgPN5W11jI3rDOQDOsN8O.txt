Hello, beautiful people and welcome to waking youth. My name is got a lotta gibberish. I'll so okay be your host and I have to say I'm extremely happy to be here with uh um you today. And in this episode, I'll just be introducing waking youth. How did I well like come up with this idea? And what waking youth is all about so uh I mean over the summer I was listening to a lot of podcasts and I was thinking well so that I really wanted to work and focus on my creativity and when I started okay so the semester I am Third-year communication student in Spain. I was also looking like okay for an initiative and I was feeling very stressed and very anxious and I like like realized that a lot of my friends were also feeling like this because we're obviously we're um okay very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and.
