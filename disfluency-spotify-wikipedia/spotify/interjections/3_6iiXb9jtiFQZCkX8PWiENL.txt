We have the story of two heroines well um okay Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan who spent their lives helping people who are blind and I mean you know uh deaf. Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan lived a little more than 100 years ago. Well like so. Helen was blind and deaf which means she couldn't see or hear her world I mean I mean so was dark and quiet Helen's parents wanted to communicate with her, but they couldn't figure well uh um out how she couldn't learn to speak because she couldn't hear people talk. She had a hard time expressing what she.
