Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about like like like the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a uh well like mentor to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, so you know I mean too often finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then well so I mean if we do find them then on the other side of the world or is so you know well too expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over um I mean like 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've well uh um been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can well you know well help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. Like well I mean. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me questions like you know I mean anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction of the cost that uh so so this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
