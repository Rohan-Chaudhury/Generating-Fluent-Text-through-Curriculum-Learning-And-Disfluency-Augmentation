Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if okay um I mean so you know you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that well you know well well well Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link so uh so uh um in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie okay like like um so was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire I mean like well like you know Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this so okay I mean I mean well straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she uh uh uh uh uh has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie you know well like okay so would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see well you know okay like so no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the um so you know okay well comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But like okay well okay um if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier you know well like well uh today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check out our like well uh well well Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
