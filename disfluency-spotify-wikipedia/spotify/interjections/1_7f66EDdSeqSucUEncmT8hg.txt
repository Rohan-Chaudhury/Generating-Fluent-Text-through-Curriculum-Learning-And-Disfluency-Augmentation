Hey everyone, so I wanted to take a second to just tell you a little bit like about anchor it's the app that I use to record my podcasts. I absolutely love um it. It's completely free. There. Are these really awesome creation tools that allow you you know to record and edit your podcast right from your phone or your computer and you know anchor distribute your podcast for you. So you can hear it on Spotify Apple podcasts uh and many other platforms you are able to make money from your podcast. You you know don't need to have a minimum listenership. And it's just really everything that you so need to make a podcast in one place. So I find it really useful and well accessible and really helpful. You can download the free anchor app or go to Anchor dot okay f m-- to get started and I'm telling you it's just like the well easiest way to get your feet wet and jump into creating your own podcast.
