You are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. I'm going uh I mean like to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's see here okay so I mean probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to believe I mean I mean uh that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of that so like I mean kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. Well so uh. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in um okay so a while, but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent um I mean you know the last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I met like so um her and she has spent all these years doing that. So she's going to share well uh uh some of her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have well like you know to apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I need to do before so so well I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
