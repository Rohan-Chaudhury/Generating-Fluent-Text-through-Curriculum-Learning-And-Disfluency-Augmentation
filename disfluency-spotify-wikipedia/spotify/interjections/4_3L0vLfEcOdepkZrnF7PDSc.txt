Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week late. I was you know so um like supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to New Orleans my well um I mean okay hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a lot of like like you know um stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after but I had well you know so like so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. I mean so you know like. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people that I see in you know uh okay uh a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New well I mean you know like Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and it uh uh you know so be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my house and no one's like so you know like here right now, which is kind of rare. So I'm trying to record before well I mean well like somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
