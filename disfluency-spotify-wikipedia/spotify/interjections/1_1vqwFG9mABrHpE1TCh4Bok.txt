Hello, you lovely bunch and welcome back to yes, another episode of the vitalife so show me Tori and Me Myself and Irene. I have nobody on this podcast and okay there's a good reason for it. I also just want to say if the uh sound quality sound slightly different. I do apologize. I haven't got my headphones and that is I mean because I am currently in the middle of moving so I have packed my like whole life up not thinking that I needed me. Fines and I'm in the middle of well a hotel because I also started a new job last week. And yeah, it's all uh decided to come at once. But the reason I actually chose to do this podcast like and do this by myself is because it's something that I want to so talk to you about just from my own personal experience for once to a perfectly okay honest, obviously with being mental health months and the last couple of episodes to kind of touching on Mental Health.
