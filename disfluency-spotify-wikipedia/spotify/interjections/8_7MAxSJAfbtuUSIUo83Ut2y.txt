As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and well you know you know uh well I mean uh okay a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was um okay you know okay uh uh uh well a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the I mean uh uh well well um you know like roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was okay I mean so um okay well so so probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not our you know well like uh uh so uh uh number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there uh I mean so you know uh I mean so like were Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure so like you know um you know um like well what is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve um you know okay okay I mean so like you know that but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was I mean I mean I mean well um you know I mean uh getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand um so you know I mean um um okay well dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and uh okay I mean well um okay you know you know honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
