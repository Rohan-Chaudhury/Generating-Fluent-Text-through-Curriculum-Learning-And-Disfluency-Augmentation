Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if uh you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. You know. I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a well production crew Link in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor like Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially I mean dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me uh get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the like Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any I mean other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now um I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts you know down in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News daily. So. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on okay her earlier today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check well out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
