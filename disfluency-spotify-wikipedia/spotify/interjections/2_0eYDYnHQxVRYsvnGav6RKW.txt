Thank you for listening by you know um the way, but if you haven't heard about anchor it's the easiest way to make well um a podcast. I know everybody's been locked up during this quarantine and a uh um few people have reached out to me and asked for advice on how to get their uh so podcast started or distribute it out there and anchors the best way to do it. You know well. It's free. There's creation tools that allow you to record and edit the podcast, so so right? Your phone or your computer? You can have your fans leave messages. Thank you you know okay to those of you that have been doing that by the way, keep them uh like come and keep harassing us and anchor will distribute the podcast for you and can I mean like be heard on Spotify Apple podcasts and a bunch more this so many channels that are so okay podcast is on some of them.
