At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a like okay Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six um so feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on you know um the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a I mean uh nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who you know well lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. I mean I mean. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much like I mean to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This I mean so was obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It uh I mean floated Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after like you know a while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
