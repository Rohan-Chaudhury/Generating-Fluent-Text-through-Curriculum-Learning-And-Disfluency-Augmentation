What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk uh like um so well okay I mean well you know about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode you know okay uh so okay so okay okay well Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really uh you know like okay so so well well I mean excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out um okay um uh well um uh well so to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were well um like uh so um uh like like just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the so well uh I mean well like uh uh okay model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool uh I mean um okay like like you know well you know looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and you know uh um uh like um okay okay uh then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and I mean um um um like so so uh you know these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's um you know uh I mean okay um well like you know gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking I mean okay I mean like you know you know like so you know like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to um okay I mean like uh well so well so upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans well um okay okay like um um okay like and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what I mean you know okay uh well so so okay I mean I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
