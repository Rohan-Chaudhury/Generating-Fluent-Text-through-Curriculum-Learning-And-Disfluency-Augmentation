He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other um uh uh religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to reinvent I mean uh uh religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while like okay okay listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I okay you know like highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of uh I mean well the speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So well okay okay instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable you know okay like when it's only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because okay you know you know I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
