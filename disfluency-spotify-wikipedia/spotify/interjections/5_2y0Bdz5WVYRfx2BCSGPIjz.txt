together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus okay um so okay um after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets up okay I mean I mean so um and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be with I mean you know you know um okay the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the father so like um um so in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him and he says well like I mean you know like to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I needed to I mean well like so so be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that um like uh um well I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude of Jesus in picking the um well uh um I mean day. He begins it by being with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
