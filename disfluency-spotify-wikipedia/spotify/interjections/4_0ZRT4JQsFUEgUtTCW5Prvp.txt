What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford in okay well uh you know London, Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is Thursday, March 5th 2020 well okay so like the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little pregame combo for you michael. Well well well well. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs loss in San Jose. But hey, uh like okay like that's okay. They had won three in a row prior The Beat Goes On okay you know um um good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to sort of so like um uh reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that we're key like um well well games against teams that were at least on par with them Florida a few points well like I mean well behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver who was like well like I mean battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come up against uh okay okay uh the team and they play three teams on this west coast swing so so okay like that are out of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string okay like so okay and they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
