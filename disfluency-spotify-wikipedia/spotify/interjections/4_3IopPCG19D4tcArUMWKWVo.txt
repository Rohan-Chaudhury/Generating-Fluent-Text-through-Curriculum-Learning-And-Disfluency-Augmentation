Hey everybody, Brayden Chase here. And this is just a quick pause here during our uh well uh so lesson on English to tell you a little bit about something called anchor so uh I mean okay anchor is actually the tool. I am using to produce this podcast for you. So you know you know so uh if you are listening to me right now, it's because of anchor now. What is okay well well well anchor anchor is a free free podcast tool that you can use to create and record well okay I mean you know and edit. Build your podcast right on your phone or your computer um okay um okay anchor distributes your podcast for you. So I don't have to track down apple and um okay uh like Spotify and Google anything it does that all automatically for me. I just kind of like so like well click the button and it goes all by itself. You can make money like uh like you know from these podcasts right this ad that you're hearing right now is an ad like I mean you know uh that I've written for them so that I can make a little bit of money okay uh uh like off of this podcast. That's why it's free, right? I can give you these things. So if you guys want to make one you can do.
