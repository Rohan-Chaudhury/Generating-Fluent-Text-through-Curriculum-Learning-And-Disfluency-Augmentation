The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were well uh friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we I mean um do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you well okay know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we uh um would have had when we first started out this would have been so like way way easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you I mean you know know, so anchor is by far the easiest way to make a podcast so I mean it gives you everything you need. In one place so you don't have to like well get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally uh so make a podcast and edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's okay you know free. So it gives you all the creation tools. You need to edit it to you know you know make it sound good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
