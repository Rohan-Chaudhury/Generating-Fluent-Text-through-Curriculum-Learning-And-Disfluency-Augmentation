Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So like um so well you know like okay for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old well you know um okay so you know uh school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one okay uh okay um um um um of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones uh well uh you know so well okay she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when uh so I mean okay okay you know so I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence okay you know like you know like so I mean seems wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself well well okay so like like I mean that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
