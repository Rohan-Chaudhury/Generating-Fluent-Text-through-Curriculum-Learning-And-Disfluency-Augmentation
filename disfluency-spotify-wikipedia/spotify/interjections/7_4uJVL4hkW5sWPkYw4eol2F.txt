Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai well I mean I mean um like so uh time major Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross rental uh so uh okay well I mean like yields in Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking about Parnell given I mean okay well uh I mean um so that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably not I mean like you know uh um uh okay likely an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a couple uh okay okay um um uh I mean of weeks ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks in New um you know like you know uh like okay Zealand and they said can you comment on an article that we're writing for our so okay I mean uh well like you know website where they were showing by the latest core logic data that the the um well you know well well okay well median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas I mean um uh uh I mean okay well a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and um like I mean uh like like I mean they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
