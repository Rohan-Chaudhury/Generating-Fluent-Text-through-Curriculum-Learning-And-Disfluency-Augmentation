I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this way you know um um um you know so by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we don't like so well um like you know often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about it more okay okay so well I mean okay and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. You know like so I mean I mean um. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is well uh uh um um um the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and um you know I mean you know uh um led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their um you know um okay um you know presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
