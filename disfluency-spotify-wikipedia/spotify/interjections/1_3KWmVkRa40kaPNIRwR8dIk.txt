Hi, welcome to you were taught that in school episode 1 taxes, everyone always writes okay after they get out of school about how they couldn't do their taxes and how um they wish school and taught them to do their taxes. And why didn't somebody teach well them do their taxes what you were taught that in school. It's called basic math like in first grade or 2nd grade. They taught you how to add and um subtract numbers. That's how you do taxes. You line them up in a column you I mean add some together, you subtract some the Part about that is you were taught I mean how to follow directions. There's directions at the top of the paper. You were supposed to well read them. You read those directions and you follow them. So you were so taught that in school that was in elementary school the fact that you can't follow you know directions and do simple math doesn't mean that you weren't taught that in school. It uh just means that you can't do simple math or follow directions. This has been you we're taught that in school episode 1. See you next week.
