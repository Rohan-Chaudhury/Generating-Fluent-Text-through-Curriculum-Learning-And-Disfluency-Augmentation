Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, there's I mean so like you know I mean so you know many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the kids um so um uh you know I mean uh do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in this household um um uh like okay uh I mean and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch not walk you know um um okay well well you know on it not run on it now jump on it and dance on uh I mean uh so like um okay it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. So when I mean well well like um okay so you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they just so okay I mean um so okay I mean can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when um you know okay I mean well uh well you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
