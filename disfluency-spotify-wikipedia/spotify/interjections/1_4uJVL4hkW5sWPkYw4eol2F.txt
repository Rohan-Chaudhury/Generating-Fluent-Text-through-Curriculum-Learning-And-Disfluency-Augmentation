Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai time major um Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross uh rental yields in Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking about Parnell given that like which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably not likely an okay investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a couple of weeks well ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks in New uh Zealand and they said can you comment on an article that we're writing for our website okay where they were showing by the latest core logic data that the the median like gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a like one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
