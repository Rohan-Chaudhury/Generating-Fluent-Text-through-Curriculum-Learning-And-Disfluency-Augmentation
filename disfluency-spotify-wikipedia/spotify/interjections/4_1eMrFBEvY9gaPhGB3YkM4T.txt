Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was like um like I mean very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in uh uh so uh front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules you know okay um like again. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the so um okay okay small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights I mean so uh okay here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing um I mean you know you know me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. Uh like okay uh. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement I mean I mean like well in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
