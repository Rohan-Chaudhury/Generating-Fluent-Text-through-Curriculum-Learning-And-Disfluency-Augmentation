If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes in like I mean okay I mean a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened it. I uh okay like um was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you saying you know uh um you know all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have like you know uh well that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And okay so um so so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad um okay so so angels and we want to remind you that that there is a stream of um uh well you know well-being which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who well so I mean I mean for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment like well like um with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being you know well like okay that is so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
