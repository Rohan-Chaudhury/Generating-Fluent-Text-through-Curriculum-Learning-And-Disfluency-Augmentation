From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian Morgan's. This well so is the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today um I mean we're looking at one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th so okay century. It's a story about for men and for women who are locked inside this uh so enormous glass dome for two years just to see what would happen. And as uh so you'd imagine it all went a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think um so things started to get a bit uncomfortable rarely about the four to six um so month Mark. I think we all knew instinctively that if ever anybody opened up okay um physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
