July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year old you know um well well came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez over dinner. He well you know you know um glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over San Jose the I mean uh so well largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it seemed like okay so uh after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just like okay I mean well well most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The drugs burned okay like um you know hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to well you know uh um hallucinate and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
