July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year uh okay like like so like I mean old came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez like you know okay okay I mean well uh over dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over like I mean so okay well um like San Jose the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as so uh um you know you know uh uh it seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just like like uh like you know you know so well most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The drugs burned you know like okay like so uh you know hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to hallucinate uh like um you know well I mean you know and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
