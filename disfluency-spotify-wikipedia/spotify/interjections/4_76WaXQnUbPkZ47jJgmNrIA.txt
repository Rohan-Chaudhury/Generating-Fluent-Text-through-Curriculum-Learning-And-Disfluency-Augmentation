Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at well you know I mean well the Gospel reading from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide like okay I mean so an exegesis of the literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from I mean um like um Matthew chapter 5 verse 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned I mean uh like I mean how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But so like um okay I say this to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you know you know okay I mean you in this way. You will be sons of your father in Heaven for okay so I mean so he causes his sun to rise on bad men as well as good and you know um well I mean his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
