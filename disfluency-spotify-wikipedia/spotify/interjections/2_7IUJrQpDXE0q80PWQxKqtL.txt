Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about um um the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor uh well to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding you know you know that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do like well find them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive or um well they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for uh well over 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been okay uh thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help more people. Okay well. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be so you know able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me you know you know questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction of the um so cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
