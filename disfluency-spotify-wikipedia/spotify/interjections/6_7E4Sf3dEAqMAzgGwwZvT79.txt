Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the well uh well okay I mean like topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I got an um uh you know okay well well email here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for is probably since okay um uh so um well late last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been coaching him now. Well so I mean um uh okay so maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got a couple of situations that so like like well well um he's asking me about so he basically he meets his All at a concert and okay uh okay you know uh you know I guess his group and her group of friends kind of emerged at some point, uh uh uh um I mean like and she listened this. She says that she told him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
