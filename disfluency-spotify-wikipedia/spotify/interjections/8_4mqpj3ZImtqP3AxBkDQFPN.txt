I have had some I mean uh you know um like like okay uh shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of okay like so well uh so I mean okay which is the fact that I have literally not had a job for uh I mean I mean you know like like okay you know the past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like well you know I mean you know like so uh like a gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my so like okay you know um um so okay bank account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for um like uh uh I mean I mean uh like a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
