Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm your host well Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock central.com Kyle and Taylor here like to talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite impressive 12-point home victory over the Mississippi State um Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and they did and uh it wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they got up big I mean early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that lead going into so halftime and then by the second half things kind of evened out in South Carolina, um they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 and most of like the time they were up by like six or something like that but it felt uh comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but a uh lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and as much as we've well talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
