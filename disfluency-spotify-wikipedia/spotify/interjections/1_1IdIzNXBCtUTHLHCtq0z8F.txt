Hey and welcome back. Hello, everybody. Hello? Hello? Hi Ryan. Hi Curtis. How are um you? I'm good. How are you? I'm so good. So so good. It's been it's I mean been a pretty eventful like week, I guess since we last recorded. Yeah, and you know we recorded this coming episode. This guests really really early. We did we did. This okay is actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this little Snippets you know recorded after your episode. Halftime, so we actually did have our guests on a little so bit earlier this week. Yeah, when he was here because of the way I mean that you know, this Gus could make it around but you know, we're recording so the intro after we record the actual episode. Typically. We like to record the intro this so this snippet part without the guest even being around. Yeah. So it just the way like it works. So usually we recorded before the guest shows up this last step the so set this guess we didn't have time to yeah. But anyways, how was how was your week bit how how things been for you?.
