I'm going to talk about uh I mean giving up Perfection or this idea of perfection for progress. And for peace. I so I mean think I think that it's it's where we find peace when we accept that. We are well okay imperfect like Just it's The Human Condition. I want you to know that every okay uh single person on planet Earth is not getting it. All right, they may look like okay okay they're getting it right because there's maybe one facet of their life that they're really like like focused on and really paying a lot of attention to but I'm gonna guarantee like seriously, I mean I mean I'm gonna guarantee that there's other parts of their lives that are sacrificing because of it, right I look at life now is.
