Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a regular so well so so so like well Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some I mean well uh so okay like um shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of which is you know I mean well well um um um the fact that I have literally not had a job for the past. Really long I mean well you know um you know you know you know time and like my adult life probably aside from like a gig here and uh okay I mean so like okay you know a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my bank account. I have okay so okay um like well like not consistently been working and I think that's for a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
