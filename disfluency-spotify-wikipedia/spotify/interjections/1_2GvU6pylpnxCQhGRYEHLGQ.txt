Okay. The number of infections in the United States overall have climbed past a hundred. Like. They're scattered across 15. It's with 27 cases in Washington state alone. As okay I mentioned that states getting hit very hard, but it's not the only one the nursing okay home outbreak apparently seated the first case in North Carolina and Wake County resident who had you know visited the Washington State nursing home tested positive but is in isolation at home and doing well. So, where are we now what's going on?.
