together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus after so um okay you know like okay um uh healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets up well so like you know you know uh like I mean and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be with I mean well um you know you know I mean you know well the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the father so well um uh uh so well I mean in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him and he says to like well um well so I mean I mean um him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I needed to be with the you know you know so uh well like so I mean father but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I um um like so like well like okay would like us to unpack. It is the attitude of Jesus in picking you know I mean I mean um I mean I mean um uh the day. He begins it by being with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
