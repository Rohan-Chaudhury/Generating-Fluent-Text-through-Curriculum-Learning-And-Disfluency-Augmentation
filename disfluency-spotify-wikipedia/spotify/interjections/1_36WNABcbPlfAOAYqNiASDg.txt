If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out like our show notes in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and okay I opened it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes well to you saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you well kind of have that habit of of of telling us all is well and okay your own words. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good uh angels and bad angels and we want to remind you that that there is a like stream of well-being which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed um about any who for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not okay allowing their alignment with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the so well-being that is so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
