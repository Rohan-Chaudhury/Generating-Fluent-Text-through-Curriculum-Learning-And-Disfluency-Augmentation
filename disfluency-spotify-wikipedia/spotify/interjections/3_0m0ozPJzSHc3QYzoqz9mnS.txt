The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were uh you know you know friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we I mean so you know do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you know, well um you know thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have had okay okay so when we first started out this would have been way way easier and it's well I mean okay much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far like like I mean the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. So well okay. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy well well I mean recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it okay okay you know on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all well so you know the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you I mean um like know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
