What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to you know um like talk about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode well like um Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really so so so really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out you know um um to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We okay well um were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out I mean I mean uh for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically you know I mean okay get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which uh you know so already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more well uh well for these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it um um so perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. So okay okay. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla well like okay as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features so like so and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would I mean like so love and the track package is one example, but what I think is an okay okay you know even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
