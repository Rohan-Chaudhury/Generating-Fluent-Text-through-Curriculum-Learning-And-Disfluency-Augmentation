And also the way that the um um okay I mean well like you know okay like I mean World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do which I mean um I mean uh so so um uh um um might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea I mean you know um you know uh I mean you know you know well um of ableism and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as you know like you know like I mean uh so I mean okay uh opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way.
