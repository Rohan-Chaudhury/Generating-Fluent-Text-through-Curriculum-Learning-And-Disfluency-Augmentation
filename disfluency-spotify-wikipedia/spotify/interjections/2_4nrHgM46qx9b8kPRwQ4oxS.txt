Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place so so suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and well you know filled the whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be okay I mean tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All so okay of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began. To speak in other tongues you know um as the spirit enabled them. Now there was staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews you know you know from every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment.
