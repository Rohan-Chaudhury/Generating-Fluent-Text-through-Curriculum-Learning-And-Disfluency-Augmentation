You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television I mean so so you know uh and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to I mean uh uh um um work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour okay well okay uh uh a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers so okay um like uh producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the well um so well well project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but not well okay uh um so necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse I mean I mean so so I mean behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from um so like like okay time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
