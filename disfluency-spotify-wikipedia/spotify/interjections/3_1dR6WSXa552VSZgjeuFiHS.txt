Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking to like so like you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology well um uh and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you you know you know you know have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your you know so uh professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get um okay um so many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is so well um our time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. Well um you know. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 well you know I mean years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I I mean so like am but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and well okay like starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
