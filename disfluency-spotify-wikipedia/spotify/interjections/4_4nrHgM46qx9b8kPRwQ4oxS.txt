Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place suddenly I mean you know um well a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled you know well so you know the whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be tongues of you know you know um like fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them uh like well you know were filled with the Holy Spirit and began. To speak in other tongues like I mean well I mean as the spirit enabled them. Now there was staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment.
