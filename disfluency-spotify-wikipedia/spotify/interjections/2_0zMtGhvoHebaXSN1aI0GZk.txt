It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a you know so small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living okay well cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose uh you know levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which like um is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the you know well pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose I mean so if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone um like insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert so you know the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble okay so and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects like um a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
