Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on the John uh um Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty seven um you know cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the United I mean you know States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 cases um um confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we you know you know haven't had any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look going on well I mean in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
