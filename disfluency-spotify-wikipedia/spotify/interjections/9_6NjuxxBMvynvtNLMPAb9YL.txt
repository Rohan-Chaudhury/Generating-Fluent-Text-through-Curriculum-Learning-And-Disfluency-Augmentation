Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release for okay I mean well so um I mean so like uh me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography okay okay uh um you know well you know you know so and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to um um you know I mean you know well you know I mean uh the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower so uh I mean uh you know well okay okay well when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I um okay like you know you know okay like well you know just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm okay like so okay um um okay okay you know not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just um uh I mean okay like uh you know um uh filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all you know I mean like um uh I mean okay um I mean these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going you know I mean okay I mean like I mean I mean I mean so to be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen to okay you know well um I mean so well okay well it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug in okay you know okay um uh well so uh well and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach your already so uh I mean so you know well I mean I mean well naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or little hit movement well well well okay so uh well uh like or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
