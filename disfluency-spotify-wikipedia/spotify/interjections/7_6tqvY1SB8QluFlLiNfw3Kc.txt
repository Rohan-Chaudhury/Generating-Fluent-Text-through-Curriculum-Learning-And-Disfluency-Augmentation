Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are okay like uh so so well so so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the okay so like I mean so uh so Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to um uh okay you know so uh okay the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that okay um like I mean um like um would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if I mean okay okay I mean I mean I mean so technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at so so okay so I mean well so the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the I mean okay I mean like um I mean well situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers so well uh well okay okay um beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a like so like well you know so uh back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
