Welcome back to emerge today's guest probably needs no introduction. For those of you who um have been following the podcast for some time as speaking with Robert Keegan Robert I mean or Bob Keegan. It has a long history of working in the field of I mean adult development. And if you're not familiar with Bob's work, you will be after listening so to this show. We do a kind of Action to his work an overview uh of the 5 stage model that he created and that has been studied empirically so for the last 40 years. And the reason why I wanted to talk to uh Bob Keegan isn't just because you know, he's kind of a huge inspiration for me but like also because I wanted to have his voice in the mix at the very beginning of this.
