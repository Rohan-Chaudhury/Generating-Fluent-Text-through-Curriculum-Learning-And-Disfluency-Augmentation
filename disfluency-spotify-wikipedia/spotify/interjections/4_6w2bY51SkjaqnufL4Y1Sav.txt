See if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is going to well I mean uh well hell and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have Adam Breeze of uh like um um Raven I with us but before we hop into that, I just wanted so okay well okay to go over I sold myself short on the last episode about my romantic capabilities. I uh well you know well think I came up on the last. Episode saying that I don't remember well so uh um what I got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards so well you know um out, but I personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got him you know um um um a heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got like okay okay like him Star Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
