I want us to talk about before we talk about you know you know well uh I mean you know you know like you know you know like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica um uh okay uh okay well you know uh well like Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have to I mean like so so um um I mean okay you know so say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell me I mean okay I mean you know uh uh well uh you know like if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back home so like uh I mean you know so like well uh well - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. You know well like okay uh well uh you know okay okay. I even went to his Instagram account.

I went down when I read um like so uh so like you know I mean I mean well this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram because you know well okay you know so like okay so um well I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
