We're going to be talking about 2/3 Capital um so um you know maintenance. Now, you're probably thinking what the hell is deferred Capital maintenance and what it um okay okay like is is it is the situation where if you buy an existing property you so okay so so buy it today and then in 10 years it requires a new row okay well you know so for Is significant expense on the hot water? It's cylinder. It requires significant expense or rewiring well well um uh the house and we know that this happens it's not something we necessarily budget for uh uh you know uh in our day-to-day expenses, but it's something that needs to happen if every couple of uh like like so months, so I not months every couple of decades and this is actually a concept so well you know well that has been brought to our attention and is often promoted by Matthew Gilligan from Gilligan drone Associates, very very intelligent.
