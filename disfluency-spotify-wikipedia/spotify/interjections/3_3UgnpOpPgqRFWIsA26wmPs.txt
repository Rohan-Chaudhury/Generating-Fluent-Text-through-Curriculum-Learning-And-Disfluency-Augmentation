Hey guys, it's Jeff Hammer your Law of Attraction coach with the dominating Edge today. So like uh. We'll speak about jumping on board. So stick around welcome back. Back everyone in like like uh 2008. I had the amazing opportunity to take a train up the California coast I mean like um from Los Angeles to San Jose. Now I've been on a train before. But I mean well like this was special. It was a Peace Train. The train itself was actually made up of privately owned railroad.
