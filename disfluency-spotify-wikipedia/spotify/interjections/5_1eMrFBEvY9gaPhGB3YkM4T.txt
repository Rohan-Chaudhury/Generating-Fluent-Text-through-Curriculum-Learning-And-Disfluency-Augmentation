Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very traumatized after um okay well okay uh seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of my eyes. Like well like okay like. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, it was so okay like uh you know uh dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on the table next I mean uh you know like like to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I also realized I like well you know you know um had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't do much like um you know so well damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first thing I tried okay so well like like was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral vision. They got I mean you know I mean I mean uh closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
