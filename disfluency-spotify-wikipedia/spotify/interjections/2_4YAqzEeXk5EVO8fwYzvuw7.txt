Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with you know um your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for tuning in you know so in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why when like uh and how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to me, let me so okay at least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about 5 years now. You know so. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a nursing home from there. I like I mean was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally like um I made it to the Private Practice World, which is really where I wanted to um I mean be I was able to sit with people for longer periods of time we set okay I mean realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were able to see each other for a um well bit more than five or ten minutes and you're working in uh okay the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes in between the doctors. The well uh patients are really tired at this point because they've been here for a while and I mean you know then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
