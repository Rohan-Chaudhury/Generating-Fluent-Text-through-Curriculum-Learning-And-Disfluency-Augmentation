Welcome to the hottest take my name is Chris Ryan. I am joined by okay I mean Jason concepci√≥n Juliet Littman and David Shoemaker and David you have before. I know that we like well fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country needs is a king. So okay. Oh my God now listen. Listen, I'm not saying we need a monarch with you know like absolute power. I'm not saying we need to go to some like Royal Dutch like okay like diagnostic system. But look at England right now how much better would our political discourse I mean you know be if we would just elect the king for every like a decade every 10 years. You know well. Donald Trump gets to be king. But we have a like a boring-ass technocrat. Well well. Who's They're as prime minister is actually making the decision, right? So he's have a well I mean guy who's a guy or a gal whose job is to go to NASCAR races and um okay give speeches and set off. The first fireworks on the fourth of July. If you want to figure out is what I want a figure, how did.
