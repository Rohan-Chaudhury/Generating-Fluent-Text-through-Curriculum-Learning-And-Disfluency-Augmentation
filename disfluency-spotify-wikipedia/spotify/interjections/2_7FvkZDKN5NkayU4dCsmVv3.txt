You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and so you know everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work on you know I mean their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a day um uh or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers producers I mean okay or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the project we I mean okay talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but not necessarily um like and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse behind uh I mean the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from so so time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
