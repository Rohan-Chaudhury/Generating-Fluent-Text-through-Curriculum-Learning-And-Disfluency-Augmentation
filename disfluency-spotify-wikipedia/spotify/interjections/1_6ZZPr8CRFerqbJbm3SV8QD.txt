Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting uh as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. Okay. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm well and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making I mean love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath like of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher okay than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
