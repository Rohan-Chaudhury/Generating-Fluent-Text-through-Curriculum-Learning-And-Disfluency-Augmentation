Just got to get up and tell the devil who you are. You gotta tell that I mean well devil who you are today. I woke up and I told the devil who uh like I am in Christ. I am complete in him who is the head of you know well all principality and power. I am alive in Christ. I am free from the law of um um sin and death. I am far from oppression and the enemy cannot come near um well me. I am born of God and the evil one cannot touch me. I Am Without uh um Blame before him in love. Love I am in right standing with the father. I have um like the mind of Christ. I have the peace of God that surpasses all understanding greater is he you know so that is in me than he that is in the world. I have received so so the power of the Holy Spirit. I have put up the old and put uh I mean on the new I have been given and it's been given to me. I uh um have no lack for my God shall supply all my needs. According to his riches. I have been called out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light of the Gospel.
