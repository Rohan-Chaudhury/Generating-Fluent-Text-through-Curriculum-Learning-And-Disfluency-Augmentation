What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford you know like so like like uh in London, Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is um um okay you know uh well Thursday, March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a well like you know you know well I mean little pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs loss well um I mean I mean you know um in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row prior um well you know so so like The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to um um so uh so so sort of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that uh I mean like you know like like we're key games against teams that were at least on par with them Florida a like okay well like uh okay few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and um um well well okay okay Vancouver who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They so you know okay okay so um come up against the team and they play three teams on this west coast swing that you know I mean um uh like like are out of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string and they uh well well so like okay got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
