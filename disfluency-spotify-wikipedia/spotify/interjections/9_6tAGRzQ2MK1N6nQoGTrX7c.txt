Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be okay well um okay like okay like well um going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to I mean I mean like uh um you know so okay I mean be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. Um so okay well you know okay so I mean okay. You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you I mean like um uh um uh okay um um want to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or okay like you know okay you know well well um uh a wall if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting so okay um well uh like okay okay okay in a chair have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your um okay uh uh you know you know um I mean like knees. So once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your like you know okay I mean so I mean I mean you know uh hands, I want you to find your navel. So with your thumbs identify um um you know um so you know so uh um your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
