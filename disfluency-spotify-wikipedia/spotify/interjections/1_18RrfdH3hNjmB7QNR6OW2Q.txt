Hello and welcome back to the not another Runner podcast. Thank you so much okay for joining today. I am so thankful that you have downloaded this episode I mean and that you choose to listen today. I've had an awful cold all week. So hopefully well I'll be able to get through this introduction without losing my voice. So today's I mean episode is something I couldn't wait to publish. The guest today is a fellow Irishman uh the very first wash guest of a podcast. And someone I have followed on social well media for a long while now. I'd actually heard of this guest okay back on another podcast God over a year ago. Now whilst I was training for the you know London marathon and I remember listening thinking wow, this guy is crazy like what he has you know achieved. I was just bewildered by his achievements. He is an ultra runner from penarth Cardiff South Wales. His name is Reese Jenkins. He.
