Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and um you know well well Shay. I have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about uh you know well like before we talk about like life. So last episode we both talked about how we you know uh um well were reading the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. So uh you know um. We don't have to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend okay you know like uh it Shea tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading uh so I mean like Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a I mean you know you know okay rock right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him uh uh so so just to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when you know okay well well I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram because uh like I mean I mean I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
