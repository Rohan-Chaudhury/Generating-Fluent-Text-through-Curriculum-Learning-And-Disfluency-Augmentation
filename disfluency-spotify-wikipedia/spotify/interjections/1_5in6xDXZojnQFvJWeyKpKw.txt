I'm the owner and operator uh of dialed Health, which is strength training for cyclists. Now today. Our topic like is all about why circuit workouts are optimal for cyclists. This topic was sent in well by an underscore Austin in do thank you so much for this idea so because he noticed that most of my Programs and pretty much all the workouts. I put you know out our mixed in some form of a circuit. So you want to know okay why that is. Is it something that really is better for cyclists. Is it just you know my style? What is that? So we're going to break down the science and like we're also going to break down some reality because you know, all the science I mean in the world. Sometimes can't get around real life factors.
