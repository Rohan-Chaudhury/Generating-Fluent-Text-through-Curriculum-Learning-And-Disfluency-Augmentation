If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes uh you know in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I so well opened it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to uh uh you saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of like okay have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own um I mean words. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and I mean uh bad angels and we want to remind you that that there is a stream so you know of well-being which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any well like who for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing their so like alignment with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being you know uh that is so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
