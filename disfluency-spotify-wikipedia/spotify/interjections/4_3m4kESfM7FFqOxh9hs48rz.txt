Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory okay uh like okay Bree and I became good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal okay so uh so State Long Beach Bree was actually taken the course because she was preparing to apply to like you know so so occupational therapy school. She has recently been admitted and we are so proud uh like you know you know of her Bree also has a background in kinesiology, which is what she studied for you know so you know um her undergraduate major and when she was still studying that she also played basketball you know like I mean like NCAA Division II at Cal State East Bay. So this woman has a lot of knowledge okay um so you know about not only how to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. We're going like you know uh well to dive into some of the ways in which she's faced some really tough situations so I mean uh um and she's had to pull out that inner strength to keep going in the face of some okay well uh uh situations where she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
