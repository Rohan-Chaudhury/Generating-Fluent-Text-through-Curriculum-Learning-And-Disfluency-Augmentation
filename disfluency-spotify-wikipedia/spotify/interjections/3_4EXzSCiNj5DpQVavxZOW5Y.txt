Hello guys. This is dr. William Cairo Bowl starting the first broadcast that I'm like um um going to be doing regularly once a week to cover the basic science of the I mean um like coronavirus and to review and sort of restore some of the sanity to the well like like conversation about this this illness in sort of the electronic discourse that goes About it to you know I mean uh try to just seal fact from fiction. There's a lot of Buzz like well I mean right now in the media. I believe that there's been a very severe, you know like um like response already like last week in the stock market and Wall Street, and I decided to do this podcast because I realized that.
