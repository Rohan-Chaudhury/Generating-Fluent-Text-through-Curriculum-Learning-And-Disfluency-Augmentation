Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about like I mean well um you know um the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor to um like okay um so you know help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding that like okay uh um so okay person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do find them you know um so so like you know then on the other side of the world or is too expensive or they just well like you know uh um uh don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 years in a so you know like so um okay one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking a lot okay uh uh okay like you know about how I can mentor more people how I can help more people. So I you know uh uh well uh well have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be able to join me okay you know okay uh so um live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me questions anything you okay like well well well like like whatever you are in the world for a fraction of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
