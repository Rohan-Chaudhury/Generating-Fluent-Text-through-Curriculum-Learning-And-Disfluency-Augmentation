Welcome back to another episode of tuxedo time where we were Tuxedos and it's time. I um well well love cast Edition. Yes, I love that when you say it. You sound like you're I mean like I mean trying to be a radio announcer. You're like welcome back to another so uh uh episode of I don't want to put my microphone. We're not in the new studio yet uh so I mean because we had a little bit of a hangout if you watch the I mean uh like Vlog that we posted at by the time you listen to this a few um like I mean weeks ago we found Mice in our basement. So we had to put our well so so project on hold for a few while we get rid of that. But in um well like the meantime now, we're sitting in our living room. So we've now recorded a podcast well you know uh in three different places. This is definitely the most comfortable out of all of them you know well uh so high so, what's the plan today? Listen? I haven't seen you in like a week I mean uh I mean and a half sure. We have one together. Yeah. Okay. So let me rephrase that. I haven't really.
