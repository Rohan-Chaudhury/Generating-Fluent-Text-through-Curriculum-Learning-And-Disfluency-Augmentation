I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal um okay okay like journey of living with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most um uh um okay of the perceived problems and worries going on in our heads could be changed uh um um so by embracing. The simple fact that we all only have one life and that um you know well you know none of us are promised another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home I mean uh so uh regardless. Of our current health status after all would you seriously stay in the job well okay well okay you hate or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your life uh you know uh so could end next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make well like okay I mean you happy and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this you know like you know um groundbreaking podcast. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
