From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian Morgan's. This I mean you know uh like is the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today we're uh you know uh you know looking at one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th century. It's so okay okay okay a story about for men and for women who are locked inside this enormous glass um uh uh you know dome for two years just to see what would happen. And as you'd imagine so so so um it all went a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started um okay okay you know to get a bit uncomfortable rarely about the four to six month mark. So okay I mean you know. I think we all knew instinctively that if ever anybody opened up physically to well like like you know anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
