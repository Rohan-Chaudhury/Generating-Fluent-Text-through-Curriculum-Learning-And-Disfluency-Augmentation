What's up, and welcome to difficulty class of podcast about all things Dungeons and Dragons. I'm okay well one of your hosts riverbed us with me. This week is a lie - man. You know um. That's right. And this week we are going to be talking about creating character hooks so like as well as connecting campaigns and then we're not answering lesser questions again because uh like we don't have any because we've been selected for any of them. So send those I mean uh into difficulty plus gmail.com. We'll do it next time but before all that Ali I mean you know are you games this week? So since the first time since we started I mean uh playing doing this podcast, I didn't play D&D this week. I've been there. Yeah. Yeah, uh I mean you haven't been there. Yes. I didn't get to play.
