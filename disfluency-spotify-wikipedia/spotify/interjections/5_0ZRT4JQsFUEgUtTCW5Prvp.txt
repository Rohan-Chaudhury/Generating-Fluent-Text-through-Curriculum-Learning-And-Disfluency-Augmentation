What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford okay like you know okay I mean in London, Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is Thursday, March um okay I mean well like 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little pregame combo okay so well you know you know for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs loss I mean uh I mean so um in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row prior The uh so so I mean like Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to sort um I mean you know uh um of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that we're well so so okay I mean key games against teams that were at least on par with them Florida a um so you know I mean like few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver okay like you know well okay who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come up you know I mean like uh okay against the team and they play three teams on this west coast swing so I mean like I mean um that are out of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string and they um so I mean uh I mean got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
