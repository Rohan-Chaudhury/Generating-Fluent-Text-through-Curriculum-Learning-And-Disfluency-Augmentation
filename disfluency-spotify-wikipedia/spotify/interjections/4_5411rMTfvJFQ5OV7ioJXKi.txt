Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update so like like well on the John Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four you know I mean well so hundred twenty seven cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and you know I mean um like in the United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at well okay uh well one. 102 cases confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that like I mean okay I mean we haven't had any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look so uh so okay going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
