Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking to well okay you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology you know well and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you uh like have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional like well life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many well okay questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is so so our time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So here well you know we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 years. Like I mean. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I am but um okay it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their you know I mean families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
