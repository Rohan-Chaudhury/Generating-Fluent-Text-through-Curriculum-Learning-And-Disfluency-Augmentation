Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a uh you know okay like uh um uh um um I mean release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the so uh well uh so so like like like I mean choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I uh like like so uh um like I mean uh well just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like you know like I mean you know I mean like you know uh like okay when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training I mean you know like you know like I mean so um uh um gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, like uh you know like um I mean uh like I mean uh but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just you know well I mean uh like so I mean well so like filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out um uh like you know well so so I mean uh you know all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going like so so so okay you know well okay um so to be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen uh okay like so I mean like like um well so to it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug in so you know um I mean so I mean you know well like okay and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach like um well so okay uh I mean I mean okay like your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or little so uh uh like okay like um uh well you know hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
