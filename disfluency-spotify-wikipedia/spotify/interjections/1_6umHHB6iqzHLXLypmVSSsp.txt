Hello friends, thank you for listening in today the theme of this first episode in uh a series is one that I consider really foundational as you know, my goal uh with pondering purple is to help missionaries kids and the people who love them to better um understand the complexities that drive us the gifts and the challenges the joys and I mean the frustrations of growing up in a multicultural Ministry focused and complicated environment. Ain't so there was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that came from growing okay up between worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and the hard then uh I went to a school for missionaries kids in Germany when I was um in ninth grade, and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite like been able to put a finger on we're not just in me my friends well at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
