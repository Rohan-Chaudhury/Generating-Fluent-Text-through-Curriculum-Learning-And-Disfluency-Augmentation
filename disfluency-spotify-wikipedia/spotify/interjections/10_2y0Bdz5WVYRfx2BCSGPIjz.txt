And when you had gone okay um um okay well you know uh um okay um up to be with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon so like um um so like like well well you know Peter comes to him and he says to him we've been looking for you know so okay um I mean like um uh I mean okay you and Jesus says while I needed to be with the father but also need like you know uh uh uh well I mean I mean uh so to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. Okay you know well um like you know okay well like um. It is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being so okay like you know okay okay like uh um okay with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
