Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through um well I mean okay um well a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down on okay well um I mean I mean so your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can um I mean okay okay like okay also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make like okay I mean uh well um sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you have you know you know well well um you know your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet Flat you know uh like so I mean I mean on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either you're sitting I mean uh like I mean you know you know or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. Well uh okay um um okay. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
