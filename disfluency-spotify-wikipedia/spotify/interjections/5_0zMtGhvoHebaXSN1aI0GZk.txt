It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a so well you know I mean I mean small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every okay um um like um living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if you know okay like um I mean blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is um okay okay well like the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. Okay I mean uh um like. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if well well uh so well the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone you know like I mean well so insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin like you know so okay um these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of well okay um um I mean glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process like um so uh uh continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
