Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking uh I mean um um I mean to you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology well you know um I mean um and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you like uh I mean well um have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional life uh okay like well so spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many questions I mean so I mean like so from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is our time you know okay well you know uh for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So here we well you know you know I mean I mean go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 years. We I mean like you know okay you know talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I am but it's you know um I mean so so a little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their families. I promise like like okay like I mean I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
