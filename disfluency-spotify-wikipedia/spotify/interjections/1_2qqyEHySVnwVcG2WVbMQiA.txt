Hi, everyone, what's happened? And I'm here with Johnny. Bargain has all she on so top and Blake all good. So today we are recording the first episode of the well podcast that we've been talking about recording for at least two or three months. Well. He has smelt a long story short may not going to be in touch for a I mean while and I made not for sample cups of coffee on the lisburn so road and we thought that the ideas and the conversation we were having um may help a few older. So this is all very much part in those thoughts into um action. And if we can help at least one other person as a byproduct of our I mean conversations recording and Publishing it then we think this is a very valuable form like to do. So, so first of all, we're just going to basically introduce ourselves so uh you can get to know us that more about who you actually listened to and then like down the line move very much want to delve into some of those deeper questions okay that may help others. So just by where personal introduction my name is Asha Monaghan. I'm from a gallon which is about 10 minutes from the organ.
