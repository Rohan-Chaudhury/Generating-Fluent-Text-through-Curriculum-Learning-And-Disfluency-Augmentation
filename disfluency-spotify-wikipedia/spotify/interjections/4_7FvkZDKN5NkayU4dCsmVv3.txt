You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and um so uh okay everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work so uh I mean like on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour okay okay um you know a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers um like so um producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the so you know like okay project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color you know uh so like but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a okay okay uh um glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color I mean um well um from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
