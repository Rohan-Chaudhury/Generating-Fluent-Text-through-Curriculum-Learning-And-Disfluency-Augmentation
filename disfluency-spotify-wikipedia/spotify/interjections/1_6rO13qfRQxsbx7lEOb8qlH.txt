Are you going to love this one? I put out so much content okay that if you listen to my stuff for free every single day if well you listen to one of my pieces of content, there's over 10 years worth you know of content. There's over tick like you can listen to me once a day for you know 10 straight years and not have to pay nothing. But guess what happened in those so 10 years Cam Newton start listening to me and middle school and high school. Then like he went to Auburn and told the coach to come get me. Then he went like to the pros and told the coach. I got to speak after all these kids like in the hood who didn't have fathers. I became their father on Instagram. So when well they went to the NBA they Daddy with him when I went to the nfl. I mean. They took their daddy with them when they became preachers and start a church like when they became CEOs or execs at companies when they look for a trainer it wasn't that I was.
