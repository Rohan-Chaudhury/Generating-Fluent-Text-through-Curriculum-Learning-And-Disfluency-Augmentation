So I go into the NFL you know you know okay so after the demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was uh uh uh you know the one with Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super well okay like like Bowl and the AFC Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the uh I mean okay okay Jets. This was the game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the like you know like you know demo and so you play that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much um I mean I mean um why you chose to be a broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a well you know like like Broncos fan because well quite frankly because I have a horse and I went and well like like so I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
