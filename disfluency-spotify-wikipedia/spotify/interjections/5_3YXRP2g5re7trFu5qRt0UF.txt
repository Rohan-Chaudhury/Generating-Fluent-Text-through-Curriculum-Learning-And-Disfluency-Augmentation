It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody okay um you know like well that you know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can um you know like uh I mean t have a conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're so okay like you know okay just here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking so well so I mean so apart. So it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know well so okay like you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it I mean uh um you know so was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Like so okay uh okay. Meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can um so um so well be totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and okay like you know so like blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
