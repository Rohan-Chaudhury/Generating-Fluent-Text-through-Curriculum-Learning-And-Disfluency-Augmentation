Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, there's you know like many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the well so kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in okay uh this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch you know uh not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance on it. Okay you know. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. So when you catch so like them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they just can't well well help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when you uh so catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
