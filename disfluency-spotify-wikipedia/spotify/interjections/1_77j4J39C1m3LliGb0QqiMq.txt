The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay well emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her like reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully you know but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit passionate I mean Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake and well eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying how I mean the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the so show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners like are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The show uh is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You can't guarantee you know an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season there will be multiple villains. Another okay user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
