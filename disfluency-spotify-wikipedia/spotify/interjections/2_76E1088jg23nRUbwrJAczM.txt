Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to so well be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine well okay to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an so I mean important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their you know I mean Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of you know uh what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. This I mean um is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to like uh become a man of value so that way other men or other people in general well you know can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If I mean okay you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit like well there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very well. Okay, well well because this video might take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen grab I mean okay a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
