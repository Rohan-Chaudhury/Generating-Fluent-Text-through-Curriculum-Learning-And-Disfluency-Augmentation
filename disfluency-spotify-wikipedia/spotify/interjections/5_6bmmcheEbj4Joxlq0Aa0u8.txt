At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a Southern state I mean okay you know like like flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six feet deep well uh so uh uh outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof watching the so okay okay well well wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw Hat um I mean um I mean um as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who lost that hat uh you know like so like is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around like uh uh you know well the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to like uh so um I mean his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very okay okay um uh like strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the well like like well like corner of the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came you know okay um you know uh back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
