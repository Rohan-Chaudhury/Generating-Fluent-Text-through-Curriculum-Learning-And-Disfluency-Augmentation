Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be your host so well for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to renew the I mean uh title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse is taken from like well John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and greatest day okay um of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who uh um is thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation to come to well well Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
