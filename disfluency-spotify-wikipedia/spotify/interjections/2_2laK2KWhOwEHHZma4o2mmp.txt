The Brian Golf Show for presented by Cobra Puma golf actual truck. Yeah, real good form before so so we get to talking about anything and everything to do with golf shafts. I got to like um give a big thank you to the man on the phone. His name is Don like so Brown. He is the senior director of marketing Innovation for True Sports is golf well I mean division up true Sports encompasses a lot. I know Don that you have a lot okay uh of product not just in the Gulf side, but true also has what a Baseball you know you know division a Hockey division lacrosse. Am I am I correct on all this before? um you know Before we get going. Yeah, that is correct. So true Sports, so we were formerly known uh you know as True Timber Sports until about the middle of last year and then you like I mean know, we have a hockey Division. I lacrosse division are Baseball division and they I mean um are all branded true. So it made sense for the parent company recalled to sports okay well as opposed to True Temper sports or to Templars were really just our golf division. So yeah, so well we make a wide range of a cross product and hockey we dress players from the states to the helm.
