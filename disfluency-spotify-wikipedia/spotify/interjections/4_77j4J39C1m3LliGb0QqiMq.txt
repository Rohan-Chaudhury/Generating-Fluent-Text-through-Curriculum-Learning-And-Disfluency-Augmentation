The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel um so well uh Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included like like I mean uh her reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled you know um well uh Tastefully but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on okay uh okay I mean Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its so well um I mean cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious so okay like okay username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the like um well I mean show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners you know like you know well are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. Okay um okay okay. The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You uh so you know okay can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season there will um I mean um so be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
