together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus um after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets up like and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be with I mean the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the okay father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him and like he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I needed to um be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting well that I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude of Jesus in like picking the day. He begins it by being with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
