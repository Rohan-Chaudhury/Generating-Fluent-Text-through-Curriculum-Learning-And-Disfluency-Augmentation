Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the so um so topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind of interesting so so so email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and um okay you know telling me how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation where I um like okay guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting a divorce with his well uh well wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she was having an emotional you know you know okay affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing is he's completely changed his okay uh um approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the interesting thing is he's I mean uh okay hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife without any kind of attachments you know uh uh or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
