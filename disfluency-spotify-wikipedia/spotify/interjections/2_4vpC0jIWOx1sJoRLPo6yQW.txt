So the time is probably going to come when I delete all these episodes right? I you know so think so. I don't want to just let it sit here if I'm not using okay I mean it, but what's happening today why I'm talking to you today is because well you know it's warm out. I think it's in the 50s to me. This is warm when so like outside was still wearing a light down coat. Had all my stuff with me as well so most New Yorkers do we're always carrying stuff. Just taking out the trash. Too warm All so like right. Someone's actually letting me cross. I'm shocked. Thank you. Almost got killed by you know you know someone before crossing the street. Thank you for being polite. So I was uh okay too hot. I came downstairs light down coat scarf in my bag too hot went back up put.
