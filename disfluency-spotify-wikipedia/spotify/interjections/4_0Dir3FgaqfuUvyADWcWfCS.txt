Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So I mean okay you know you know for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old you know you know okay okay school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one like okay uh well of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she like so well well saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was I mean okay you know uh about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly okay okay uh um inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
