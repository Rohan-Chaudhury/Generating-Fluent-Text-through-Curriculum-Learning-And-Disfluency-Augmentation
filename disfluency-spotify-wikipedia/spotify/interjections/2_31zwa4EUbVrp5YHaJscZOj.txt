And anyway, obviously you can imagine the feedback was was was mixed and one like uh individual this Rob he owns a gym. I believe it's called CrossFit rise you know um again. I apologize Rob if I'm fucking that up. You know, he shot me um so a DM and you just like bro. I don't I don't agree. I think this um you know argument is pointless. I don't get it. You should strive to do both uh uh like and he just didn't agree with it which was but he reached out okay well to me and show me a DM and I do what I typically so like do when I hit him with an audio message and explain my position and well um you know next thing, you know, we're back and forth with a few okay well audio messages and the guy, you know, we're we went from adversarial to you know, I probably go get a beer the.
