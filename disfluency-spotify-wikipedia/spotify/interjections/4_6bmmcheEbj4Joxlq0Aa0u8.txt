At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a Southern okay okay like like state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six feet deep you know well uh like outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof um um you know so watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw like uh uh you know Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who lost well I mean okay okay that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around the you know um you know well corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to his surprise. Um you know well uh. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very strange. So okay well well well the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of the house I mean I mean so I mean and came floating back down again after a while. It came back Upstream yet you know I mean like uh again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
