Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting like um well uh uh as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You uh I mean I mean like so come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and you know you know uh um I mean you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making um so like I mean you know love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath like um you know you know um of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high um um uh so um higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
