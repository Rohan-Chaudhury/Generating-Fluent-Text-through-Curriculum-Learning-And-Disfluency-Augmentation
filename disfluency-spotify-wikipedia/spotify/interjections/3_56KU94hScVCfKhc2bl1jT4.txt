Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I okay you know well really appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this well so okay way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we I mean I mean well don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about it well okay like more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything I mean like you know else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is uh well I mean the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and I mean well I mean led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their you know uh like presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
