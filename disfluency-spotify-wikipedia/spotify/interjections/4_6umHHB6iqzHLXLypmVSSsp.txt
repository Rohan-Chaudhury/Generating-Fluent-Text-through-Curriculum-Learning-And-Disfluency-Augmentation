Hello friends, thank you for listening in today the theme of this first episode in so I mean uh you know a series is one that I consider really foundational as you know, my like you know well okay goal with pondering purple is to help missionaries kids and the people who I mean so well well love them to better understand the complexities that drive us the gifts and the challenges like like okay like the joys and the frustrations of growing up in a multicultural Ministry focused and okay I mean well I mean complicated environment. Ain't there was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences like like well you know that came from growing up between worlds and of the push and pull of the well like I mean like happy and the hard then I went to a school for missionaries kids um I mean uh uh in Germany when I was in ninth grade, and I quickly came to realize okay uh uh well that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite been able to put a finger on like like um okay we're not just in me my friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
