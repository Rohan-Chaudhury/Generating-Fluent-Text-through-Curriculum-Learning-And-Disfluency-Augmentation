You know, well okay you know like I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to serve each other okay well uh so to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's like we're uh um uh uh you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know was a success well so you know okay not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because we just weren't I mean like you know so having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make you know, a you know okay um I mean lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that it's just um you know like well a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
