He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and okay you know so like uh okay other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to okay well you know like um you know reinvent religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while well uh uh uh um well listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I highly uh you know well you know okay uh recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the speakers um I mean well uh okay so in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead of uh well I mean okay I mean okay Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's only coming uh so so well I mean well out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
