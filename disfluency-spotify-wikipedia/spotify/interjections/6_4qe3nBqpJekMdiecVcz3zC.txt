What kind of interesting um like uh like okay so email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work like I mean I mean uh uh like and telling me how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation uh like so I mean I mean uh where I guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting like like uh so um um a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she okay okay like so so okay was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently.
