Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may ask well that is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven years old Nate nasty um couple of nicknames. He had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Ace Qbert um Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I assure you okay I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years but the reason you know we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because he has a propensity to okay disappear and I'm not saying like three four weeks at a time or maybe even you know a couple days when I get my sad boy moments. I'm talking six months to a like year. This man can disappear at times. He has a lot of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
