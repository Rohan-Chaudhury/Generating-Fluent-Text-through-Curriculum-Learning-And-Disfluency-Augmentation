I'm Jason, I'm Rosie. I'm Paula. I'm sin and this is thoughts and confessions. So you know. Yo yo yo, what's up guys? What's up? What's up? So this week has been very okay um interesting for me. I also like I've been dealing with some issues one can I mean you know say towards in terms of anger in terms of when people would say like like um Darkness. And just trying to find the ways for me to be uh um able to kind of marry that anger that I have inside with the positivity that I I mean okay also have inside. We all go through that I guess so how deep it does um uh the rabbit hole go super deep Bro Whitey. Yeah, like it's something that like I so uh sort of I think it started when I actually traveled to Trinidad this year. So I went through the Christmas.
