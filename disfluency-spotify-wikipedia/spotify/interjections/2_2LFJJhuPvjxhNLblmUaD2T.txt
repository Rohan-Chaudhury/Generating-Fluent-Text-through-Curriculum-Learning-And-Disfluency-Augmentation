Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. Uh you know. We are joined. Once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very I mean well special episode. I like these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological career of the competitor or like uh the coach that we interview in this case. We interviewed. And since it was um like the second time we had him on we'd already covered his career. And so I uh well got to talk about a lot of things on this show and I had um you know I'd get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on a lot of different like well things and we kind of went through a couple topics one was his little brother so um Greg just want his fifth State title High School in New York. And so we I mean you know talked a little bit about that and then Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
