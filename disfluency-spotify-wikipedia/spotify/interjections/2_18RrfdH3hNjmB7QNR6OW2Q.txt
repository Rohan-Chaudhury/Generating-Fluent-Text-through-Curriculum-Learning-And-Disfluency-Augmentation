Hello and welcome back to the not another Runner podcast. Thank you so uh so much for joining today. I am so thankful that you have downloaded this episode and I mean well that you choose to listen today. I've had an awful cold all week. So uh you know hopefully I'll be able to get through this introduction without losing my voice. So today's episode um okay is something I couldn't wait to publish. The guest today is a fellow Irishman the uh I mean very first wash guest of a podcast. And someone I have followed on so um social media for a long while now. I'd actually heard of this guest back on okay so another podcast God over a year ago. Now whilst I was training for the uh uh London marathon and I remember listening thinking wow, this guy is crazy like what uh like he has achieved. I was just bewildered by his achievements. He is an ultra runner from penarth Cardiff South Wales. His name is Reese Jenkins. He.
