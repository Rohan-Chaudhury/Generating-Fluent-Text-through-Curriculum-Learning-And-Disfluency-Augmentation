Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic you know so of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind of interesting um well email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and telling me you know okay how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation where I so you know guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting a well okay divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she you know um was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing is so so he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the okay well interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his like I mean wife without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
