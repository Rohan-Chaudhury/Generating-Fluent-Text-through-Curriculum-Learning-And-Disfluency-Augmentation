What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about well um you know uh the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S uh so like uh and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited like so so okay about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to like well like you know the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We like like you know you know were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came well I mean okay okay out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can okay um okay uh basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 uh so like I mean which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand you know so okay uh more for these new tires and these brake pads which are geared I mean uh uh like to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's well so I mean um a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity you know you know uh um for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of so well well um these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and um so so well like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but um so like um what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
