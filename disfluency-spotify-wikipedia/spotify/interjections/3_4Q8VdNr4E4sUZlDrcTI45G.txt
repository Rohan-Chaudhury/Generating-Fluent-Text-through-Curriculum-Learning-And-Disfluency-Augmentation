Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I so well um guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that so um uh I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little you know um you know bit the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. It well uh you know is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here um I mean uh towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John I mean so well starting in verse 19 following it says this and the evening of that I mean um uh first day of the week when the disciples were together with the doors locked um well um for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace you know like okay be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
