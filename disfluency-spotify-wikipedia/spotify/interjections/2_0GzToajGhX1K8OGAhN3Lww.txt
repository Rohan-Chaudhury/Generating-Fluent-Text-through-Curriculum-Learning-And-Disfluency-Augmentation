Welcome to the first ever episode of version final a podcast about where ideas um I mean come from. I'm Ben Pereira and I'm a strategist at cnx. The creative agency accounting I mean like Nest. Our aim is to talk to creative people in advertising media publishing technology okay like education and more the ideation process can be a little bit of okay like a black box to those of us who aren't designated creatives in organizations. We hope so like these conversations can shed some light on that as work becomes more well like D industrialized and more service-based more and more of us are expected to be creative you know like as part of our jobs. Our hope is that by talking to people who work okay you know daily with incorporate constraints and still managed to be consistently creative the rest uh so of us can learn how to tap into our own creative sides the idea for you know like doing a podcast about ideas came from watching how Conde Nast magazine Brands operate cnx and Conde Nast magazine Brands create content for different purposes, but we work pretty.
