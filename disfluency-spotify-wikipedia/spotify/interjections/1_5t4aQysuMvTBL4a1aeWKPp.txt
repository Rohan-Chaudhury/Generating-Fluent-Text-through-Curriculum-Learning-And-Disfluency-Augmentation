From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian Morgan's. This well is the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today I mean we're looking at one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th century. It's you know a story about for men and for women who are locked inside this enormous like glass dome for two years just to see what would happen. And as you'd like imagine it all went a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started well to get a bit uncomfortable rarely about the four to six month Mark. I think well we all knew instinctively that if ever anybody opened up physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
