It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how well I mean you know um tough you are. It will beat you to your knees and keep you there um well like like permanently. If you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, you know okay um so but it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can uh uh uh so get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving uh I mean you know like forward. That's how winning is done. Well, if you know what you're worth um so okay you know then go out and get what you're worth.
