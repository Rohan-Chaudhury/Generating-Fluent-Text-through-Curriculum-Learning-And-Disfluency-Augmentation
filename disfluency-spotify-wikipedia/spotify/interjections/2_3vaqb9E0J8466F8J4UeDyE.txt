Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you want um well to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that Madison Pruitt uh so with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description and I along uh like with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be like um 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced well well as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming uh you know something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has uh you know to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie okay so would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no I mean so other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in so well the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But uh well if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on so uh her earlier today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you like so check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
