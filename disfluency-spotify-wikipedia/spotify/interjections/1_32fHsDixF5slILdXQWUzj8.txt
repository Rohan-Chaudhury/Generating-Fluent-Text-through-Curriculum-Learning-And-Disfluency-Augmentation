It's Brock sale from the Bronx Tale podcast. And today I'm going to be telling you so about my favorite app, which is Anchor. It's the best app to use for any you know type of podcast. It's free. It's easy. You can use your phone computer or um any other device to record it. And once you post the podcast, it doesn't well just go on acre. They post it on Spotify to get your podcast more exposure so and to help you out in my opinion. Anchor has everything you need in one um place and it is the best platform to create. Any type of podcast I think um this is episode 4. I don't know how many episodes I've done. This I mean is Braden. It's a hybrid. Nice to meet you meet who? Yeah, I don't think anybody um lists the rest doesn't matter. Yeah, fuck it. We're going to talk about the combine like that just happened and how the Panthers are going to get the best pick I mean in the draft again because they're picking it seven then that's where we pick Christian McCaffrey.
