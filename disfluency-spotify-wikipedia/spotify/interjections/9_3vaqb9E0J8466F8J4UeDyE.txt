Well that theory is officially dead because Claire uh I mean I mean well well I mean I mean you know uh Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this well you know um so okay I mean well like I mean straight.

Is there any other reason Maddie uh well you know you know you know um I mean so I mean would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no okay like okay well uh like you know I mean uh other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in okay uh uh I mean like um well so like the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily.
