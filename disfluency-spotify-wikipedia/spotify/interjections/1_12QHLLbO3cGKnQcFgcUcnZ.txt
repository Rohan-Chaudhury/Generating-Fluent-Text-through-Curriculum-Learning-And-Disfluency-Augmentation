Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If you follow um me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know that I post regular well devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of God. And that is okay basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking at real life scenarios and situations, I mean but the End of that, we'll be using and speaking very specific scriptures that I mean we can use in those challenges. My heart behind this is that as we go through like tests and trials which we can't obviously avoid but we will our mindset that we so would go through it will be different. I am so convinced and I have you know been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
