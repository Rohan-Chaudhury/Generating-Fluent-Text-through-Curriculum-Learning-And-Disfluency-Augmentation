My name is Aaron Ross. And this is the dirt Confessions of a tree planter um like art for this podcast comes from another tree planter Bethany Davis as part of I mean well her illustration series follow the trees. This is a podcast about tree planting as a well like reforestation practice in the Civic culture industry tree plungers are a collective of people who I mean I mean spend much of their lives replenishing the logged area with New Forest. However tree planting I mean like is so much more than the physical act of planting thousands of seedlings in uh like the ground day after day as a Job, it is about the connections experiences bonds and I mean like memories that last a lifetime. The dirt is a place to shed light on uh so the culture that is mostly contained within those who have stuck with shovel in so so the ground. It is meant to dive deep into all things tree planting uh uh as a place for those to reminisce relate more to learn. So wherever you're um I mean coming from as any tree planter would say May the planting Gods be with you. Hey everyone, I.
