Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really appreciate so your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this okay way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something you know we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk um about it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike so everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which okay is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them um up a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he was transfigured his okay face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
