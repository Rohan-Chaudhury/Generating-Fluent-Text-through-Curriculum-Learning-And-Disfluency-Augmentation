I actually I actually didn't have the mic in my hand. So. I got okay like a fat callus on my hand right now. Sorry, I like sandpaper. It's so um all right. But yeah, so sorry about that long break we took we were you know well just really busy with midterms papers. We went on a Hiatus we just were busy. Yeah. Well um. Sorry, not a Hiatus. That means we're like temporarily broken up. It's a short break. Okay spotty spotty neck.
