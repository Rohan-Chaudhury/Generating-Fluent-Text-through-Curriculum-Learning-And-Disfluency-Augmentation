Welcome to the March 3rd 2020 edition of coronavirus questions answered with dr. Brian McDonough. Here's so I mean um where we are at this very moment. We know that in the United States um so like the death toll has climbed to 9 in addition. We know that those cases are based in like um uh Washington state at a nursing home in Seattle. Most have occurred. The number of infections um like okay in the United States overall have climbed past a hundred. They're scattered across 15. Um I mean well. It's with 27 cases in Washington state alone. As I mentioned that states getting hit okay I mean okay very hard, but it's not the only one the nursing home outbreak apparently um um um seated the first case in North Carolina and Wake County resident who had visited the well like uh Washington State nursing home tested positive but is in isolation at home and doing well. So, where are we now what's going on?.
