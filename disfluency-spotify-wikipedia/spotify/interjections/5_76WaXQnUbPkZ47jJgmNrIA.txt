Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the Gospel like like well like I mean reading from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an well uh so uh okay exegesis of the literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter you know I mean okay I mean so 5 verse 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how it was um you know uh well I mean said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say this to you so you know okay well uh love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in this way. You will well like okay I mean so be sons of your father in Heaven for he causes his sun to rise on well um like okay uh bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
