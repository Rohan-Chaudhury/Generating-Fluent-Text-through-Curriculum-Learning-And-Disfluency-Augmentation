Hi guys. You're welcome to the be more with all the report cast. So. Thank you for joining me again, and you will not believe it guys. I I mean promise you it was not planned. I have another friend with me today. She came so visiting for my health and lifestyle, you know, you have to get these things you know in order for the journey ahead and we were just having conversations about, you know, okay doing things by yourself. Cough now, you know, there's this whole part of it that uh says, you know, you have to collaborate and do all those great things. But uh there's also the part of you doing this goal this particular goal by yourself, uh but me how far now you know, so I mean, we're just we're just going so to flow today and we just hope that you guys get what you need to from this podcast because the truth is sometimes the goal is not necessarily.
