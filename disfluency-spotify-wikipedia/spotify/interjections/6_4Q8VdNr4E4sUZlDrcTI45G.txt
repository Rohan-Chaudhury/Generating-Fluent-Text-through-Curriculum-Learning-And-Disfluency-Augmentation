Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I guess uh like like you know okay okay there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that I had a well um okay well um you know surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little so uh so okay uh I mean bit the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. It is I mean I mean okay um okay I mean difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here towards I mean like so I mean so I mean the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 following uh uh uh so uh like it says this and the evening of that first day of the week um okay well well I mean I mean when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the jews. Like you know well um so like. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you after uh okay like I mean uh um he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
