Hey, what is up CI squads? We're back. We're back with another episode, well 's I'm pretty energized right now. Just got off the back of doing some live training okay to Bluestone College. I did four locations in one hit which is the power okay of the internet and amazing technological breakthrough where you can be in four places you know at one time. So very very exciting stuff and that's kind of inspired. Is this um little podcast that I'm putting together for you today? But before we get into so that, I want to give a shout out so over the last couple of weeks. Uh. I've been running a little bit of a giveaway. So for anyone that leaves you know a review on iTunes and sends me over a screenshot. I will enter them I mean into a draw to win a little little gift from me. So I just well been scanning the reviews we've had some new reviews come through and I'm going to pick how.
