It doesn't make me afraid I did not injure myself. So there is no need uh well to worry or I don't need to worry that there's damage. And anyway, this is so I mean just what I'm feeling and I know it'll pass at some point and movement really seems okay like to make all the difference which I think is so cool. Hello, everybody today. Okay you know. We are joined by Jenna and she's one of my clients and she's actually I mean well turned into a quite a dear friend of mine during our time together. And so I mean um today we are going to be having a conversation about her journey that led so so up to her and I working together where she's at. Now what she likes um uh about our time together things that you can't stand also perhaps we'll see where it uh okay goes. But the goal of today is to highlight her journey in the hopes of connecting.
