Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on Vale. I um so you know you know was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder um well I mean okay song as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And all it okay uh okay I mean did for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me of all like I mean like you know time, which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, first I mean uh I mean so of all when you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got to um like you know um go. Um, man, I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's my you know um well um favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on it. Well so uh you know. Is that Love's in Need of Love today? We need to give the love like I mean um I mean back to ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted okay um uh uh to get you to consider that you can apply this to lots of things um um like okay in your life and fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
