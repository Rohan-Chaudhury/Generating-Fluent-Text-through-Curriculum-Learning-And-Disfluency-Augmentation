Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the I mean topic of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This you know is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is uh you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel uh like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going so to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great um and you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days well it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just okay a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and well your life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that uh business you want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic okay for you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
