Grand Prince Vasily the third ruler of Muscovy raced toward his wife's bed chamber well like the fateful day had finally arrived. His first child was about to be born as he um like rushed past the Windows. He heard the crack of thunder and a deluge of um like rain spattering against the glass. He stopped in his tracks the weather reminding him of um I mean a prophecy. He'd heard years before if you do. Do this evil thing you so uh shall have an evil son your nation shall become prey to Terrors and tears um okay rivers of blood will flow. The heads of the mighty will fall your cities so so will be devoured by Flames. He shook his head. He couldn't think about so uh those words now his sin had already been committed now, he must be beside his wife in greet his child in the midst of the Wind and Rain.
