Hello, welcome to the theology pug cast and we're glad to have you with I mean us again. And it's the whole crew here today and we're going to do this ourselves like in a minute, but guys, I realized just the other day that we've been at so this for a year. Well, I think this is like episode 56 or something. Maybe it uh maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers out there to correct us, you like know, occasionally we do say things that are not correct often speak for yourself. Um. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the show, but like that just has because we do is almost zero prep. We just kind so of come from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think most like of the time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from so someplace else. Never glad. I'm glad that I don't think it's ever happened to I mean Glenn. I'm glad you got me last week on Warfield and Whitfield. I've uh not heard the end of it my colleague Frank a mullet. Yeah initially when you.
