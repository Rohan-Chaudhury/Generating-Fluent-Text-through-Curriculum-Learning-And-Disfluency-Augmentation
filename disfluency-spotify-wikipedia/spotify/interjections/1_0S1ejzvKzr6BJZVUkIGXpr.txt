A few months back. We did a call-in show. Hello. This is Josh. This is Tiffany so Walling McGarity. I'm one of the three founders from medical and you our listeners voted so Tiffany Walling McGarity on Pitch Island going from a phone call to the pitch well room isn't an easy trick to pull off today. We'll hear a pitch the likes of which um we've never had on the show before. What does it pitch sound like before any okay revenues even before the product is built in all the founder has is an so idea and a gut feeling that that idea could turn into a big business um today on the show. What a pitch sounds like when all you have are a few scratches uh on the back of the metaphorical napkin from gimlet. This is the pitch. I'm Josh puccio. You know. Let's meet the investors and Maya Bittner Maya built to financial tech companies and sold them Bowl. Now. She's out scouting startups for Sequoia. One.
