Hi and welcome to the fort down podcast. I'm Ben. I'm so and we're like well here to talk about American football. So I go into the NFL after the okay um demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one with okay well Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and the AFC you know I mean Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This was the um you know game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you play well you know that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much why you chose to be a so uh broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a Broncos fan because well quite frankly because you know like I have a horse and I went and I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
