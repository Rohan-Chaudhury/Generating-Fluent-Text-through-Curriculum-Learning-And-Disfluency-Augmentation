You are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. I'm going like to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's see um here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to believe that like now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of that kind you know of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. Uh. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a I mean while, but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent the like last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I like met her and she has spent all these years doing that. So she's going to um share some of her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have you know to apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I need to do before I mean I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
