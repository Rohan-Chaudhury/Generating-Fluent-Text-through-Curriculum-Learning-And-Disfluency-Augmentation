Hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised a bear um and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. We are going to take well you on a journey blank to the Future and before you and ask where we uh are going. You don't need green arrows and that's a good thing you know because you're not going to get them here at least not in this episode kind you know of a topsy-turvy week that saw several Blast from the Past tear up the you know usual FPL narratives and cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s film references and of like course I'm talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace which Drew assisted one. Uh. I believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he could be considered a precursor um to America's Alonso. And of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before we get into this any.
