Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through you know uh so so a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying like so well you know down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You I mean so okay you know can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want uh like um um to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if uh so okay like you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair I mean you know um well have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once uh I mean well so you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you so well uh I mean to find your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
