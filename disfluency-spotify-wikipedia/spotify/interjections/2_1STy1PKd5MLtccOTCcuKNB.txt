Happy birthday, the weed tube. You're two years old. And I love you. This um I mean is fun to speculate a podcast where we speculate about wild and crazy ideas. And uh well now here's your host Aaron Richard. Hi everybody Welcome to a brand new episode um well of fun to speculate. I'm your host Aaron Richard and sitting next to me is well uh producer Vlad. Hi guys. I'm back. Well, yes you were sick last for the last um you know episode. That's right. Yeah, because in the grand scheme of things we recorded I mean well it's actually been a while since we like sat here to do and like like episode 2 because we recorded so many episodes in like a three-day time span and we had I mean uh a nice little break in between and now we have to catch up and like okay record one like every week or schedule another week of insanity. That's okay though. So uh. I love this show. I love this show. I want this show. I hope everyone in okay so the world listens to that's a little bit extreme, but, you know, I hope a um uh lot of people enjoy it. I hope we keep the topics coming in good thought-provoking ways, and I just hope we always keep it entertaining for you. So, thank you.
