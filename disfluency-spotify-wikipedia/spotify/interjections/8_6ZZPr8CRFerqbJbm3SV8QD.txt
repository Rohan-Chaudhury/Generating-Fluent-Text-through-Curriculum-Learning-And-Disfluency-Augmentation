You come uh uh okay you know you know well um so and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm so like uh um so like well you know and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of okay well so you know okay like like um making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath I mean uh well well like okay uh like of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher so uh I mean so you know you know so so than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
