Hello, beautiful people and welcome to waking youth. My name is got a lotta so I mean you know gibberish. I'll be your host and I have to say I'm extremely happy I mean well um to be here with you today. And in this episode, I'll just be introducing um okay so waking youth. How did I come up with this idea? And what waking youth um uh I mean is all about so over the summer I was listening to a lot of podcasts I mean um so and I was thinking that I really wanted to work and focus on my creativity and well I mean well when I started the semester I am Third-year communication student in Spain. I was um you know uh also looking for an initiative and I was feeling very stressed and very I mean so well anxious and I realized that a lot of my friends were also feeling like you know you know uh this because we're obviously we're very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and.
