It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a um you know like well well I mean small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every I mean um well okay uh um living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy like um okay you know uh you know if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on well I mean well uh so um osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as so well I mean um so like blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. So so I mean okay well you know. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases so well well you know well I mean the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence uh I mean so so I mean so of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of you know uh you know you know um well glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process you know I mean well I mean you know um continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
