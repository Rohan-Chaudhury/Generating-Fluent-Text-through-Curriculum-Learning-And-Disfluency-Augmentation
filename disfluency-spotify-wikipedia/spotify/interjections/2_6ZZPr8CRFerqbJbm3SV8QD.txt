Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting okay um as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. I mean like. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm okay so and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making so okay love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath of um um Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher than like uh the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
