As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and a half. Like like. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was uh okay a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the okay like roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was um like probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not so you know our number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there were well uh Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure what you know you know is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but um so also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids uh you know on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth like uh state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
