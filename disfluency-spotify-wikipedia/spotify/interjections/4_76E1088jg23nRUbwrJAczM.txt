Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining to um um so you know each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine to I mean uh you know like determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an like well uh like important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their you know uh so I mean Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of well I mean um so what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. Um I mean okay uh. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want well well okay so to become a man of value so that way other men or other so so I mean well people in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. Uh um um well. So here's the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if uh uh I mean um you're a person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, um uh okay uh you're not going to do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little like you know uh I mean bit to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five to um so um uh ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
