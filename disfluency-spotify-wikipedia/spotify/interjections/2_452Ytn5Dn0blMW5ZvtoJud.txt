Hello and welcome to Fitness unfiltered episode 64. So this is our first in a couple so I mean of weeks due to some scary scheduling issues. For those of you that did notice they well so be a large percentage of you that didn't notice but we did promise you know okay that it would be worth the wait. So before we get into it is only so um right to acknowledge that I'm also joined by Emma and Mike as always so M. How um well are you I'm fine. Excellent and Mike, how are you? I am also fine. So I mean. Okay, so statements of I'm fine pretty much make sure the world goes around um well I think so. We are actually joined by another and we are honored and okay I mean excited to be joined by Doctor David. Robert Grimes who is a physicist cancer researcher well um award-winning science writer and author of a best-seller, which I'm not just saying this because he's you know so they're here. I did actually say it to Mike off air as well. It is one I mean um of my favorite reads of 2019. And the irrational type which we all are irrational apes are times I think so.
