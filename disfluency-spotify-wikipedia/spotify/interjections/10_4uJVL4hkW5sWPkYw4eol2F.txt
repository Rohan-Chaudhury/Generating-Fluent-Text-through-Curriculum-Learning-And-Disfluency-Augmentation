We're going to be talking about gross I mean uh okay um well like uh um okay okay rental yields in Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking about so okay like like like you know so okay um um Parnell given that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably well uh um uh well so well well um so not likely an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a couple so so um I mean uh okay so so like so of weeks ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks in you know so uh you know so um well like so like New Zealand and they said can you comment on an article that we're writing for our okay I mean so you know you know so uh like like so website where they were showing by the latest core logic data that the the so well okay well you know uh um you know so you know median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom uh um uh like well uh so um you know like apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
