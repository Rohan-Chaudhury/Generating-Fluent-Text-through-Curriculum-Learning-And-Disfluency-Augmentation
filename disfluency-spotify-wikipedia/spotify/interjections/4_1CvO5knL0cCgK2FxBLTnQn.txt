Hello and welcome to vlogger History season 2 episode 2 My name is okay well um uh Ann Foster. And this is a feminist women's history comedy podcast. I don't know so I mean so you know why I made there be so many words in explaining what it is, but okay uh so um I think I've explained it properly in every episode so far. So in okay I mean um well season one, we were looking at women who who made history by quote unquote misbehaving which I mean well okay um is sort of like also not Don't quote misbehaving because several of them did murder so so uh um people this season we're looking at women leaders and how men complained and were freaked out about it and how it's not so different from nowadays when.
