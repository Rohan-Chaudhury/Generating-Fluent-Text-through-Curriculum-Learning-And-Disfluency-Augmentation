The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel uh like Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading well well shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully but both okay so fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit uh well passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have so so its cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user so uh and ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a uh uh Asik environment for bullying and the show taking no accountability for it was okay uh crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability well well for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The show is specifically designed and run you know you know around the notion of having a villain. You can't guarantee an engagement or a I mean okay happily ever after but every single season there will be multiple villains. Another user um uh responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
