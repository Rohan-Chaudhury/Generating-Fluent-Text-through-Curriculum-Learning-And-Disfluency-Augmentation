This is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's begin in you know well well the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen was you know so so called a mind all those we promise to pray for. I think the most so okay uh exhilarating truth is that before the world was created God already had you and I okay well uh in mind each with our own particular place in the grand plan of history that okay uh so no other person can or ever will take we were designed for this role and uh uh I mean only we can fulfill it and if we don't no one will Father favor and uh well you know his spiritual conferences rights. No two of us are alike. God saw a specialty um okay so in US eternally, it was this specialty which he loved it is this specialty which decides our place and our work and his creation.
