Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability you know um uh become so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is well um okay a fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she like you know uh came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the I mean well well World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may so um um do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea you know you know I mean of ableism and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied like you know you know as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very you know okay uh specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really um like well interesting conversation. I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review And well well um subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
