Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So okay like you know um I mean for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original like you know okay I mean uh old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was um uh well I mean like one of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the I mean so well okay uh first ones she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when like well you know so so I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and I mean well you know so uh violence seems wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so like I mean so okay uh before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
