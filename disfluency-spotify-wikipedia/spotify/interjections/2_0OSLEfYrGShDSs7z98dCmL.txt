Hello, so turns out that people do actually want to listen to what I like so have to say, which is pretty shocking because my own boyfriend doesn't listen to what like um I ever say, so there's a surprise but I'm glad that everyone is on board well okay and I'm excited for this little journey this little educational Journey that we um like are going to go on together. I've done a little eye. Like organizing and like um okay note books and stationery and stuff and lists. So I've done list of so I mean how I want it to pan out whether or not it pans out like well you know that is another story because I can be a little bit impulsive. So we shall like you know see but I want you to shut your eyes everyone that's listening. Please unless you're you know you know driving. If you're driving, please do not show your eyes, but shut your eyes and remember the last time that you ate.
