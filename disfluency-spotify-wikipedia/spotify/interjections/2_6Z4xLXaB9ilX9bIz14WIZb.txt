Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing it so like in a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The men of Lewis I mean like and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks of the like um Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day of traveling I mean okay the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in so like their midst. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp so you know lured by bison meat that had been hung up to dry. If it decided okay well it wanted to snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware of like okay the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
