Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works um okay hard towards Ascension. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I uh uh am joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the you know you know dream speakers in another episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I thought um you know it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I I mean you know am doing fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the so you know woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours you know um just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where um uh they take it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that well uh for two hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot um okay that Australian summer time and North American summer time do not occur at the you know well same time. So I'm like, let's figure out a time to record what will be good and okay you know I'm like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like um okay I can wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
