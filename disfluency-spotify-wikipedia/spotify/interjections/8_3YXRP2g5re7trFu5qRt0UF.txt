It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you I mean so you know uh so well I mean like know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a okay you know like uh uh you know like okay conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here well I mean so I mean you know okay so I mean to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So like okay so you know like so um so it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you um I mean okay you know well you know okay like know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was um um I mean well well uh uh uh enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. You know well like you know well you know I mean so. Meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless uh like so like I mean like well okay that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah you know you know you know like like well like I mean blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
