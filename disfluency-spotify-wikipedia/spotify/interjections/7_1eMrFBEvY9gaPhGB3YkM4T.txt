Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very traumatized well like well well like uh so after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of my eyes. Um well uh uh so I mean uh. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, it was I mean okay um like you know you know uh so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on the I mean uh I mean you know uh okay okay table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I okay um um uh okay like you know also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't um I mean you know like uh you know so do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first so well like um uh like you know thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral um you know I mean you know okay uh okay vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
