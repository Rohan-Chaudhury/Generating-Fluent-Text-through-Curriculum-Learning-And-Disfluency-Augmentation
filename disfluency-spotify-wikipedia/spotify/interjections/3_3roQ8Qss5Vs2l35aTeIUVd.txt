Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things you know you know so well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me well well so that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six okay so I mean of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on um okay you know a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on like okay um it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for uh so uh sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not you know you know um supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little skipper. Well uh well. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency like um so to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
