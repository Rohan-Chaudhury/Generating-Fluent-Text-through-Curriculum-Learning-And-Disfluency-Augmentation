Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on the John like uh um so like like uh like uh Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty seven cases worldwide I mean okay uh well like so so uh well 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the United States. We um uh well um okay uh like you know um have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 cases confirmed with six deaths you know well um well so you know like I mean I mean all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we haven't had any deaths so so well okay like like like uh well in California. And so there might be something specific look going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
