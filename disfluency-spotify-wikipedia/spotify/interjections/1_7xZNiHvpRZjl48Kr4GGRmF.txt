Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I like have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk like about like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading okay the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have uh to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell uh me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's you know back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock well right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just like to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when you know I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his so Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
