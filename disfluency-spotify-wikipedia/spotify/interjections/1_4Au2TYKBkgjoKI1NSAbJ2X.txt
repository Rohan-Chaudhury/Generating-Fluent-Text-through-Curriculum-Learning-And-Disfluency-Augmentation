What's up, everyone? Welcome back. This is a bit of a different episode well today. This is actually an interview that I did with cave on Divani on his okay total Bitcoin show. So I was a guest on his show and cave-ins super nice uh guy been putting out a lot of great content around Bitcoin a lot like of great people on a show really interesting format and had a great conversation okay with them. So I thought I'd share with you guys here as well just like to note the first half there was I think we had some bandwidth issues. So the the uh audio was spotty in places, but hopefully it's not too disruptive. If you want well to follow cave on his podcast is called the total Bitcoin podcast and his Twitter uh handle is at ke y VA en DAV a and I and that's it. Enjoy the show. Let's do it. Hey, John,.
