Due to the graphic consequences of today's disaster listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is advised for like okay listeners under 13 at 3 p.m. On August 20th, 1910 Forest ranger Ed Pulaski and a um uh ragtag team of young volunteers were clearing brush on a ridge above the town of Wallace, I mean so Idaho. It was a hot day but the sun was obscured by smoke Pulaski uh well and his Squad were on the front lines of an effort to combat. You know uh. Thousands of small wild fires blazing along the northern reaches of the Rocky Mountains for well okay weeks. He and his comrades in the newly formed US Forest Service had relentlessly um uh cleared swaths of forest to Halt the fires, they were overworked and understaffed. But so I mean many members of the service still believe the situation was under control but Pulaski worried um like the worst was yet to come when smoke from the fires blocked out the sun around 3 p.m.
