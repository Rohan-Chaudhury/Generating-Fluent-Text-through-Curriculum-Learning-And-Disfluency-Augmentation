So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, like you know uh well um I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach um okay like uh you know because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard uh you know so uh you know it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into uh so like I mean okay this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I okay um well I mean okay know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a well well well well like loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me so okay like um I mean okay very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been uh I mean okay so um so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
