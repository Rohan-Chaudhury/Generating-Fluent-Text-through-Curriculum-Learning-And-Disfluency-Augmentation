Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as we I mean well okay um breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You uh you know um uh come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and um I mean um so you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making love well uh um okay my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath like uh you know um of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me uh I mean you know well high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
