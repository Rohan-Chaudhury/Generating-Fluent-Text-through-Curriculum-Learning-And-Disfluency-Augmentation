Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, there's uh uh I mean like well so many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the well so like okay I mean uh kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in okay okay uh like so you know this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on um um so you know okay okay a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and so like like uh you know okay dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's I mean uh okay well you know uh it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed okay uh um uh um I mean to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the okay like um so uh like couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll uh you know you know okay well you know tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
