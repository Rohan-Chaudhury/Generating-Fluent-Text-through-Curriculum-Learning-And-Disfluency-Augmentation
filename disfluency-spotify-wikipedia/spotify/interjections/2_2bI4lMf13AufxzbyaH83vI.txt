Hi everyone. Welcome back to skincare Somali A's your favorite bi-weekly skincare podcast. I'm well well Natalie and I'm Jessica this week. We are talking about what we I like to call uh I mean the great exfoliation debate because we've got two different points of view and we're going well uh to Duke it out. Mano a mano this week. We will also of course do so okay our wine pairing because we are your Somali A's and this week we're going with like well something a little bit more aggressive a little bit Bolder just like exfoliation. I would like okay well to recommend Santa Julia winemakers Reserve Mountain blend. That is a Malbec and cab Franc blend from 2016. It's just a little bit.
