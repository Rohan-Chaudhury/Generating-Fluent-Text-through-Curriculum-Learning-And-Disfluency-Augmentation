Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. We are I mean joined. Once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very special episode. I well like these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological career of the competitor uh or the coach that we interview in this case. We interviewed. And since it okay was the second time we had him on we'd already covered his career. And so so I got to talk about a lot of things on this show and I had I'd um get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on a lot of different things and so we kind of went through a couple topics one was his little brother Greg just want well his fifth State title High School in New York. And so we talked a little okay bit about that and then Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
