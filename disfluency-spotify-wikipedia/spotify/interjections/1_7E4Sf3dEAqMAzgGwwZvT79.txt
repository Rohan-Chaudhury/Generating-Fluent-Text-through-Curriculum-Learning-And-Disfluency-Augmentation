Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic like of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I got an email you know here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for is probably since late uh last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been coaching him now. So. Well maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got a couple of uh situations that he's asking me about so he basically he meets his All at a I mean concert and I guess his group and her group of friends kind of emerged I mean at some point, and she listened this. She says that she told him to text um her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
