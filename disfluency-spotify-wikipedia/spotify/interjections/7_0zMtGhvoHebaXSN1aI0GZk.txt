It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small range you know well so um um like um Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. I mean well okay I mean okay um I mean. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if well so well like I mean well so blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, I mean uh okay uh well uh um which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood like well like um well like like flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. You know uh okay well um well so. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the uh um I mean you know well so okay hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of um uh uh well uh like I mean insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose so I mean okay um uh okay uh that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until well um you know you know you know I mean um the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
