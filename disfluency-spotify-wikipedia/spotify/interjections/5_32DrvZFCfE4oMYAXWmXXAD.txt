Hello and welcome to come want to start off the show by giving a fond so you know so I mean well farewell at least in the context of a presidential candidate to Amy Klobuchar. Amy Klobuchar well you know uh well so has in recent weeks and months on some level endeared herself to me. I mean I mean well like well I mean kind of a Madwoman if you're not familiar with her, she wasn't particularly viable uh like uh well well as a candidate it seems She got a shot. Someone say surprise. Someone say shocking some would say rat fucking endorsement from The New York Times along.
