It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small okay so okay um well okay I mean you know um okay range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. Like uh so I mean like um okay um well like. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood uh so uh so you know um like okay I mean um glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is um um okay um um um uh you know uh okay the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. Like well I mean you know uh like uh okay okay I mean. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the concentration like well um uh okay you know you know you know you know um of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream I mean so well okay you know you know I mean so uh uh the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose like like like so uh uh okay well okay I mean into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be I mean so like well um okay you know you know okay well stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood well you know you know so I mean uh so well um uh glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
