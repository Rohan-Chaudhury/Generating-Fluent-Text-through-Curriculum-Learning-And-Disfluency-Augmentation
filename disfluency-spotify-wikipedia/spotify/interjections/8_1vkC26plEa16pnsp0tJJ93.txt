Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon so so uh uh um okay like like to leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on okay you know like well you know like uh so Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest you know so like um well well okay so some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going I mean I mean I mean I mean you know so uh so to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I um like okay okay I mean uh um okay know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you um so uh um okay okay well okay cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented uh so okay uh um well well so athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but okay like okay uh like I mean um I mean they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly so like uh so well well uh so swinging your view of a player but we did learn some things some players I mean um so I mean I mean okay like uh had much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
