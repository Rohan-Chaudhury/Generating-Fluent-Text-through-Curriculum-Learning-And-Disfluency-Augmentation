We are stoked because today is part okay um um I mean 2 of the October Gonzalez interview and we have been absolutely dying to release um you know uh okay this one. So this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and man. There are so so um um some nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear it. If uh I mean so so this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going back and listening um um well uh to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think that all of the okay okay um well information in part to her story all her tips the way that she parents it's like uh so you know all like so much more interesting and almost more like valuable when you know like um like um where she came from part 1 is all about her life as a young um you know um like girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her as a young woman and uh well so okay it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
