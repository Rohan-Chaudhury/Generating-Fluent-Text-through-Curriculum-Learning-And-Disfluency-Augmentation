Well, good afternoon guys, it's Jack Russell here with my channel Festival selections. We're um going with day one. The Tuesday first race of the day of the meeting well is a supreme novices hurdle grade one. We've got shishkin at five to two Astro and well phalange 72 Abracadabra 601 change warehouses noise and then we've got my pick a last 25 so to 1 Nick ends and seconds during the race with Jeremiah McGraw confirmed to be like riding him on the day. Two main Market while I was issued in a stirring for so lunch. They probably deserve to be up there because they've got probably the um best form of all the horses in the race. She skin very impressive as two wins. Like. And again asking for loans and being free starts this year looking very very impressive okay indeed two wins over hurdles and one in a bump of him. I've gone so without a heart he is a two-time winner over hurdle so far this season, so he filed his first start over the obstacles at Ascot last year very well back.
