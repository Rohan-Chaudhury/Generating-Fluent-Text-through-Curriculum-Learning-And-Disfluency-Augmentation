So thankful that you're here today and I am um going to go ahead I normally have you stand to read the scripture is 19 you know verses today. So go ahead and sit down and we'll take it slow. God bless like you. My scripture from today's point of view is Acts chapter 11. This sermon like will probably take two weeks to preach. We did it last night. The Lord showed okay up. I thought he did till nobody said there was here last night. Yeah. To me he showed up. And so we probably won't get to.
