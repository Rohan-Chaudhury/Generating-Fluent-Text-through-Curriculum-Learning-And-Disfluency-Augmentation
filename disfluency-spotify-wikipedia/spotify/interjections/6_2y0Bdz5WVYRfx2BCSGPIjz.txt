together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus I mean okay so uh um okay after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets you know okay okay you know well well up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be with so okay uh so um like the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the father in well you know um I mean well um prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him and like uh like well uh uh he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I needed to um okay like okay like okay be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely I mean I mean well like I mean I mean interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude of Jesus um um uh um so I mean in picking the day. He begins it by being with God the father in prayer. Like like you know like you know well. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
