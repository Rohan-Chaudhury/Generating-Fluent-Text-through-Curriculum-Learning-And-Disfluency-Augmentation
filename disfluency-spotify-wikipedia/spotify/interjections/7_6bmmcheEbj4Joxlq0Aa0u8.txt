At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a uh um okay um well uh okay Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six feet like okay um you know so you know okay deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the porch uh I mean like well like you know um roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw well like like so um I mean um Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who lost um um well you know uh um so that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of I mean like okay so uh like well sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the well well okay like okay like uh river suddenly much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream I mean I mean so well like okay so against the current. This was obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye uh like so like okay I mean like on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back you know you know like uh uh you know like down again after a while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
