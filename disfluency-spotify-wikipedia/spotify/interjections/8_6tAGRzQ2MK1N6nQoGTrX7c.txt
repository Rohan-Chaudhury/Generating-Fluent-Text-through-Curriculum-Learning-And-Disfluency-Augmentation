Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be well you know I mean so um well like uh going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation so uh okay you know um I mean like you know is to be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at well well okay like well uh I mean well your sides. You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting well so so um you know I mean okay so you want to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or uh uh um like so you know uh I mean a wall if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a so okay um you know I mean you know so um chair have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. I mean uh um so like um uh okay. So once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, like I mean I mean like I mean um you know you know I want you to find your navel. So with your thumbs identify your um well I mean so like so you know okay navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
