Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week late. Okay I mean. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to New well uh Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a lot of stuff I mean like going on and I could have recorded like the days after but I had so I mean so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. Smear I well um have errands to run I was linking with people that I see in a while. Okay you know. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New Orleans and my so okay mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and it be loud like I'm so okay finally recording because now I'm finally in my house and no one's here right okay uh now, which is kind of rare. So I'm trying to record before somebody try to I mean well come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
