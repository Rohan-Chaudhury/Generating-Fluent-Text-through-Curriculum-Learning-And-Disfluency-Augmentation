Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a you know like regular Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some um like shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one you know you know of which is the fact that I have literally not had a job I mean you know for the past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like a uh um gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my like you know bank account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for a few reasons. You know like. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
