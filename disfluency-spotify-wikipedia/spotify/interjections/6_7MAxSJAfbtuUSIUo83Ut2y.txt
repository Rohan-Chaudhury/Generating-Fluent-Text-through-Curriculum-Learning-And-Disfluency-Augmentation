As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a um so you know okay so okay hoot and a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so like okay I mean uh like uh it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the well you know so okay um well roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably a so uh uh I mean so uh fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number one problem and so okay okay so I mean like really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there were Current objects of well like um um I mean okay pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure what is safe uh uh okay uh like uh for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but also you know okay I mean so so I mean objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids I mean uh I mean you know like you know on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded uh I mean I mean well I mean so money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
