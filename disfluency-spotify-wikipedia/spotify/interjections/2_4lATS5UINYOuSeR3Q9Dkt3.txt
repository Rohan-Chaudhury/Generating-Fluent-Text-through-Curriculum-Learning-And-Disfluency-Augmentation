Hey guys, welcome to the ladder talk. This is John. It's been a while since well I mean we had episode with just me and Gerard So today we're going to have a discussion I mean uh about the ethics of flipping. Now the way we're defining flipping for the conversation well um today is just the selling of any shaving related item that's significantly marked up so uh from the original price. We hope you enjoy the conversation and now onto uh I mean the episode. Hot cake flipping okay, if you can sell a Wolfman for $2,000 all the power to you. I don't know how to respond because.
