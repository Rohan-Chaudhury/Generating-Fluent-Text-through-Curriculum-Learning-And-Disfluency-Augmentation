Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the Gospel reading okay from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an exegesis of the literal like sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter 5 verse 43 to um 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how it was said you um must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say this to you love like your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in this way. You will be um sons of your father in Heaven for he causes his sun to rise on bad men so as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
