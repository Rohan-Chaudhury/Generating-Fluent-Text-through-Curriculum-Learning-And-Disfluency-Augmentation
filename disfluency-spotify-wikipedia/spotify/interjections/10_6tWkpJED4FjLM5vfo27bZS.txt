The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel so like uh okay uh you know um you know uh you know Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading okay um like so uh you know well you know um so shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully but you know so like so okay well um um you know uh both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit passionate so uh uh I mean I mean I mean you know uh so well Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its like so well okay well um you know you know uh um cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying I mean like I mean okay uh uh like I mean so I mean how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the you know like well you know so you know I mean well okay so show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show I mean well uh I mean I mean like like uh you know you know Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. Like um you know so you know I mean I mean you know uh well. The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. I mean like I mean okay you know so I mean uh well you know. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season so uh um I mean um um um well um like there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity you know okay so um uh so well I mean so well and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
