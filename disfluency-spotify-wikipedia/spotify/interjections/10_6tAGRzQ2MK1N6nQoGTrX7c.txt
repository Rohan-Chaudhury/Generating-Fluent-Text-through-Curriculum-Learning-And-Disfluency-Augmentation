Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through um so so um um like you know okay like uh a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying um well I mean I mean I mean um uh so uh you know down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You you know uh so I mean I mean well uh okay um uh can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want I mean like um so uh you know I mean okay um well to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall uh okay uh like okay I mean I mean uh so uh if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your so I mean so okay well like okay like well well feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find I mean uh well uh well well I mean well like well either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find um um okay you know um okay okay uh you know so your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
