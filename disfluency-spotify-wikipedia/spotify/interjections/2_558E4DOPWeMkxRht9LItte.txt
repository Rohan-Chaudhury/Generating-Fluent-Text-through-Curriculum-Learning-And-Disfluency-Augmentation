I always have a cebit my house. You know you know. I'm pouring and now I always try to put together something as I mentioned the you know you know other day. I'd only time I ever write anything down is Is there well okay something going to shop a super work for husbands or also for Purim believe it or you know uh not? Because they always write a five or six or seven page Arturo whatever uh uh couple whatever did I like the liver because important you drink, you know know, you you know so know, you can't remember what you're saying. So I have a text in front of me. So well um hopefully you can't go wrong and my son from Israel wrote me that sent him a driver toga. For his Yeshiva, and now they're going through the.
