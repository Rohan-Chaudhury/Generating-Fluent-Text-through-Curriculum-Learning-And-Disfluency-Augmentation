Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a I mean um uh okay release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget um like okay okay the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just I mean okay um okay listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I mean I mean uh like I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training okay you know I mean I mean gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, okay you know like you know but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. Uh I mean um you know. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or I mean um I mean uh stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's so uh like okay going to be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen um well okay you know to it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug okay uh so uh in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach well okay you know like your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or I mean I mean well so little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
