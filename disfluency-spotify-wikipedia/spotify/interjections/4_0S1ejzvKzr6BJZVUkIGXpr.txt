A few months back. We did a call-in show. Hello. This is Josh. This is I mean like like like Tiffany Walling McGarity. I'm one of the three founders from medical and you you know well I mean like our listeners voted Tiffany Walling McGarity on Pitch Island going from a phone call uh well like well to the pitch room isn't an easy trick to pull off today. We'll hear a uh you know I mean okay pitch the likes of which we've never had on the show before. What does it um um well so pitch sound like before any revenues even before the product is built in all um um like you know the founder has is an idea and a gut feeling that that idea could like like I mean um turn into a big business today on the show. What a pitch sounds like when like okay um okay all you have are a few scratches on the back of the like you know okay so metaphorical napkin from gimlet. This is the pitch. I'm Josh puccio. Let's meet the investors you know okay well um and Maya Bittner Maya built to financial tech companies and sold them Bowl. Now. She's out scouting startups for Sequoia. One.
