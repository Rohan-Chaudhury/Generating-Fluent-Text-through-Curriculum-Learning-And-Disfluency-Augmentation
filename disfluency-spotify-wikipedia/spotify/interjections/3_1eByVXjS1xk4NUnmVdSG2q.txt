The NHL is apparently unveiling a new Puck filled with Quote unquote electronics and so well well they're going to be testing out during the playoffs. This is the first time you know so well they're going to throw it in used at least that we know of so read a little well uh well article about this AQ and we were just talking about this before we went live here. Um so so. They've apparently used this puck in a couple games during the regular season without telling okay um you know the teams or players that they were using it. They've given it to a well well uh few of the Superstar players throughout the league the practice with the see if you know uh uh they can notice anything feedback was generally positive. Of course only one player noticed some issues with it. No Sidney Crosby. He said he could notice.
