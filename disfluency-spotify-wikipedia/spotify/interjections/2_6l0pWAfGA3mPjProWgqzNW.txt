Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may ask that like you know is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven years old okay well Nate nasty couple of nicknames. He had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Ace Qbert so okay Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I assure you um I mean I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years but the so um reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because he has uh you know a propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four weeks at a I mean well time or maybe even a couple days when I get my sad boy uh okay moments. I'm talking six months to a year. This man can disappear at times. He has a well so lot of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
