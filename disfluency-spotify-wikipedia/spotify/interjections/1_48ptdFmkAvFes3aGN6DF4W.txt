Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will okay be your host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus you know and to renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the um memory verse is taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on you know the last and greatest day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice you know let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation uh to come to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
