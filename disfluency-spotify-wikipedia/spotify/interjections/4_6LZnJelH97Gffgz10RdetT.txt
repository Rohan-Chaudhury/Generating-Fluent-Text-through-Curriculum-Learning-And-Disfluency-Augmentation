Hello, everyone. Dr. Davidson Edmund. I hope everybody's doing very well and staying healthy. Today so so well so we're going to talk about their coronavirus. But first of all, I'd like uh um I mean um to introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm a board you know like like uh certified Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see you about um um okay okay 40 50 patients a day and the office I'll still go to the hospital and like well uh well usually have a census. It's been 5 to 15 patients, including ICU and um like like well critical heal patients. So literally my patients have been very worried about the core virus and so uh you know I mean to be honest who is not been worried about this. Okay? And therefore I've had multiple questions regarding, you know, what what what they can do to protect.
