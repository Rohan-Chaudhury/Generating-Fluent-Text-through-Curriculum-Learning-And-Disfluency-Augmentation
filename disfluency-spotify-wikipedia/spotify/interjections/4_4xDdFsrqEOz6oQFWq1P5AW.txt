Welcome back to best our of their day on today's episode. We are talking about like well you know okay the principle of quarter extremity that idea of quarter extremity movement. But also quarter extremity movement violations, so so well uh we're going to dive specifically today into the importance of it and where to look in um um I mean you know a handful of different movements. So Fern first question I have for you like well like I mean is when were you first introduced to the concept? out of quarter extremity uh uh so I mean the book definition of it at the level 1 course, however physically introduced to it okay so uh okay probably day one is an athlete like as a little kid. They just don't teach okay okay well um it that way but when you teach any type of throwing mechanics, typically the first thing well uh I mean well you teaching most kids to do is probably jumping or throwing something right. So throwing a football or baseball as a child and and learning how to do that. That's.
