July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year old came well um uh you know I mean like home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez over well like you know like okay like dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over San Jose like um uh um like like the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it you know um well I mean so like seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just like um you know um uh like like most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The drugs like you know so well uh I mean burned hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to okay well um you know okay so hallucinate and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
