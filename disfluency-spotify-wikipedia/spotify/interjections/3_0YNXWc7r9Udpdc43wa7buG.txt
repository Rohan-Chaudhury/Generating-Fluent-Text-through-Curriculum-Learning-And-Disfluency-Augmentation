I'm Jason, I'm Rosie. I'm Paula. I'm sin and this is thoughts and confessions. Yo yo so like so yo, what's up guys? What's up? What's up? So this week has been okay um like very interesting for me. I also like I've been dealing with some issues one um like you know can say towards in terms of anger in terms of when people would say like uh um you know Darkness. And just trying to find the ways for me to be um I mean um able to kind of marry that anger that I have inside with the positivity like so okay that I also have inside. We all go through that I guess so how um uh well deep it does the rabbit hole go super deep Bro Whitey. Yeah, like it's you know um well something that like I sort of I think it started when I actually traveled to Trinidad this year. So I went through the Christmas.
