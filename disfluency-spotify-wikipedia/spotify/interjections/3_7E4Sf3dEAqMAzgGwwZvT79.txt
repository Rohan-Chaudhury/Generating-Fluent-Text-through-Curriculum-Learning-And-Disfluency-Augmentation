Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and okay like uh the topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I uh so so got an email here from a client of mine that I've been coaching well like well for is probably since late last year by eight eight nine months. I like so like guess. I've been coaching him now. Well maybe longer so he sent me this email uh I mean you know and he's got a couple of situations that he's asking me about so he basically he okay well I mean meets his All at a concert and I guess his group and her group of well uh okay friends kind of emerged at some point, and she listened this. She says that she told uh okay um him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
