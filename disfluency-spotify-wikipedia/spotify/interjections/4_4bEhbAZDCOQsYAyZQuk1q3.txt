Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard towards ascension. You know I mean I mean like. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I am joined by so uh so well terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream speakers in another okay okay so I mean episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I thought it might be nice okay like I mean okay to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I am doing fine. Um um uh you know. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the woo Kang now we like like I mean okay talked for almost two and a A half hours just about the Wu-Tang um you know like I mean because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it where you know um okay well he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours wasn't um you know so so quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer you know I mean okay well time and North American summer time do not occur at the same time. So I'm I mean I mean okay um like, let's figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm like I mean okay okay like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I can like I mean like so wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
