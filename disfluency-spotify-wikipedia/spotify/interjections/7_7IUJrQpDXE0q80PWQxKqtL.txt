Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things uh I mean uh I mean so so I mean about the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor like you know you know uh like well well to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often I mean okay you know I mean you know um okay finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do find them okay I mean okay okay I mean I mean so then on the other side of the world or is too expensive or they uh so um okay uh you know well just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 years in okay uh I mean like you know okay you know a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking a lot like so well you know well well well about how I can mentor more people how I can help more people. So I well so like okay uh so so have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be able to join um uh well uh well uh I mean me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me questions anything you um well like you know well like okay like whatever you are in the world for a fraction of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
