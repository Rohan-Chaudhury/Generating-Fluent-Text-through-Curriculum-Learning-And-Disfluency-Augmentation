I was intending to spend some time discussing how I mean to use them as narrative devices, but following some feedback and realizing have a uh lot of Basic Ground to cover I'll be focusing on the man of courses um primarily from gaming perspective. This is a longer episode than I initially planned and you'll um probably notice a slight change in Styles throughout the main section of the shug.
