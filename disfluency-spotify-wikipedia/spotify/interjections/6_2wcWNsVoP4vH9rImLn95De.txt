So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I uh so like I mean uh um have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I um well I mean well um so had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it like um so uh I mean okay can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this pattern you know you know I mean like well um of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know okay um uh like you know well better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop and um so well I mean so uh it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me so um I mean so okay okay um very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so powerful that well you know well well you know uh he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
