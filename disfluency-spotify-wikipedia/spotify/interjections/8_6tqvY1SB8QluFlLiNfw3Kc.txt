Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires okay okay uh um uh you know um I mean are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of like I mean uh well I mean you know okay uh the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due so so okay okay so so well like to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because um like uh like you know okay like like that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if okay uh okay okay like um okay I mean technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at I mean okay like I mean I mean okay like like the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that you know you know like okay okay uh um I mean is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So so well uh um okay like uh I mean the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of okay um um um uh like so you know a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
