Hope that is exactly what Paul is talking about here in 2nd Corinthians well chapter 5. We're going to start this section in verses 1 through 4 I mean today 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 beginning in verse 1 for we know that okay if the tent that is our Earthly home is destroyed. We have a building like from God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for I mean in this tent we groan longing to put on our Heavenly dwelling if indeed by so putting it on we may not be found naked for while we like are still in this tent we groan being burdened not that we would be unclothed but that we would be further.
