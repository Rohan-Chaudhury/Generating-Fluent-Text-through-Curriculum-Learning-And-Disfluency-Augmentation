Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about um the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a okay mentor to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often okay finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we well do find them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive like or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 I mean years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking uh a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can so help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. Like. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can you know ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction like of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
