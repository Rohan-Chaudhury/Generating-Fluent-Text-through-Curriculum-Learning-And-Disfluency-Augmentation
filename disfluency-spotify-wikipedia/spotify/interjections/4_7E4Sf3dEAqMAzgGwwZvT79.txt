Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic well well you know okay of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I got an well okay well well email here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for is probably since uh um I mean uh late last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been coaching him like um well um now. Well maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got a couple uh well you know I mean of situations that he's asking me about so he basically he meets his All at well okay you know okay a concert and I guess his group and her group of friends kind uh well like you know of emerged at some point, and she listened this. She says that she uh I mean so well told him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
