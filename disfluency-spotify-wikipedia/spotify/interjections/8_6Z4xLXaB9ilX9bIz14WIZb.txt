Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing um you know I mean uh okay um uh uh it in a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The men of um so okay well you know okay you know you know Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks of I mean like okay well I mean I mean well uh the Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day of traveling you know um well okay uh I mean I mean okay the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in I mean you know well okay I mean okay um okay their midst. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp um like okay um okay I mean you know uh lured by bison meat that had been hung up to dry. If it like okay you know I mean so um you know I mean decided it wanted to snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it uh I mean I mean okay so okay I mean you know unaware of the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
