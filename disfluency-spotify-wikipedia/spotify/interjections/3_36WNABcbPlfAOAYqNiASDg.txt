If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes you know so well in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened it. I you know I mean so was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you uh you know well saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of well okay I mean have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own um well well words. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad okay I mean you know angels and we want to remind you that that there is a stream of well you know okay well-being which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any um okay you know who for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing their I mean okay you know alignment with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being so you know um that is so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
