You are listening to do includes live podcast with a McMillan and Becky Ward where like we talk about doing your 20s in the 2020s. Hi guys. Thank you for joining us you know for our first ever episode of doing quarterly podcast. And this week. We are well celebrating women. I'll is international Women's Day on Sunday the 8th of March, so we thought like it'd be a good opening topic as two female podcast. Has Amy what could uh stuff have you heard in the news this week? Okay, so I know in a uh moment you're going to be talking about a really huge piece of news that was like covered in the media last week. So I thought it might be so nice for me to start with maybe a slightly smaller you story that people haven't like necessarily heard about and I was scrolling through Twitter last week and stumbled across like an article about hair salons and basically a number of salons across the UK have been boycotting gossip magazines.
