It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you like uh I mean I mean I mean I mean know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. You um um like you know okay um know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here so I mean like so um so to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So um so so I mean I mean so it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know you know so like uh you know okay was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because like uh like well so I mean we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make I mean so so so I mean I mean you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless like you know like uh like you know that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, you know you know so okay okay so but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
