It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you know, I mean you know so I mean um okay like you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. You like you know okay um uh so well know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to serve each so okay so I mean so okay well other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's like we're well okay uh so so I mean so you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know was a success like you know so so uh so uh not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because we just like um uh uh well uh um weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make you know, a like um well like uh like so lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that it's just uh uh okay like um uh okay a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
