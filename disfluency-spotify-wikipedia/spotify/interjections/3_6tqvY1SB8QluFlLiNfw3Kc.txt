Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are so so um I mean nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the metropolitan. So like you know. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the like so well tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would you know um uh make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if okay I mean um technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at the points it so okay okay is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the situation we are discussing um so so right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes I mean so uh four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
