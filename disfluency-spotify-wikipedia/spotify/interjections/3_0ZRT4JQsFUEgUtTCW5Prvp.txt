What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford in London, like okay um Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is Thursday, March well uh like 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a you know like you know little pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs uh you know okay loss in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row okay uh uh prior The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have um well okay to sort of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Uh you know like. Road that we're key games against teams that were at least on par with them Florida like like like a few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division well like so and Vancouver who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come up I mean uh okay against the team and they play three teams on this west coast swing that uh well uh are out of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string so uh you know and they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
