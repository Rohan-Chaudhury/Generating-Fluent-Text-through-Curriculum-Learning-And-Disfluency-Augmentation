Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope I mean you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this I mean episode starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of okay this podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this uh podcast. I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking I mean about random stuff, you know catch up with me sounds like a good well title. But then as I recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started like to figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know okay notice a lot of the things that we covered from the past few episode is okay about mental health growing up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a you know young adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically well growing up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So um basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the well podcast and basically having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
