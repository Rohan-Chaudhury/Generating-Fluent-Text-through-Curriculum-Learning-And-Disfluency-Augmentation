From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian Morgan's. This is you know uh well I mean uh okay um um the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today we're looking I mean okay uh I mean so uh well well at one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th century. It's so so um like I mean so okay you know a story about for men and for women who are locked inside this enormous glass dome okay I mean like okay like I mean I mean um for two years just to see what would happen. And as you'd imagine it like you know I mean you know like like like uh all went a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started to uh uh well uh like well well like get a bit uncomfortable rarely about the four to six month Mark. I think you know I mean um uh you know you know like I mean we all knew instinctively that if ever anybody opened up physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
