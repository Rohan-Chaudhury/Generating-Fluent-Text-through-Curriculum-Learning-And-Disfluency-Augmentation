Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and shay. Okay I mean. I have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk uh okay about like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the well okay Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have to well okay say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell okay well me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back home so um - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. Um okay. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just to I mean well see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when I so I mean read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram like like because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
