Hi guys, welcome to the dead by tomorrow podcast. My name is Daniel winter and well my co-host is Andrew Monroe in each episode. We're going to explore topics that are too um important to wait until your last day on Earth as we introduce each well topic. We encourage you to remember that some tomorrow will be your last so each so new day could be your final chance to really live. This week we'll be covering okay introductions for Daniel and I where the idea for the podcast came from I mean and some of our topics moving forward. Thanks for listening. Okay, Andrew, what would um you do if you were going to die tomorrow? If I was going to um die tomorrow? I would probably do something involving being shirtless for starters and hopefully something you know memorable at the same time. You know, I've got this idea in my head of that scene from that movie. I can't remember where the guy.
