They sit on this color couch of mine for um uh so um so so well so uh an hour a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might okay I mean okay you know uh well well uh you know be directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now so so okay I mean I mean okay um you know okay our work. On the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes well like I mean um so okay uh I mean so it's color but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. Um you know so I mean okay you know you know um so. It's a glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about well uh so I mean I mean I mean okay okay um color from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
