He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and like other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to I mean reinvent religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend like while listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I so highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of so the speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. Okay. So instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still you know enjoyable when it's only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I mean I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
