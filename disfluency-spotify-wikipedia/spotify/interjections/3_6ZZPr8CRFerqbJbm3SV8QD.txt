Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you well like like grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree like um uh of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. So so uh. And I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds um I mean so of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath you know well you know the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You okay um okay make me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
