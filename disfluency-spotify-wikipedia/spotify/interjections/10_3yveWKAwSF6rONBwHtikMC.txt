Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had okay well um so um so well okay well uh girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he uh you know like I mean like I mean you know uh uh well do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, it's um I mean um like okay you know I mean well um like very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl uh so well well so you know okay well uh uh duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing gcses you know so you know uh well um I mean so well I mean and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be in I mean well um I mean you know uh uh uh you know so three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need so uh uh uh uh you know well you know well I mean to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever so so you know so um like um you know you know you know is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
