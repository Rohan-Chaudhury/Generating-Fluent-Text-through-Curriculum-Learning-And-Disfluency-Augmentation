Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to like I mean I mean so well leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this so uh um you know you know on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to okay so like okay okay digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're so well you know you know like going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. Okay I mean so okay okay. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate uh um I mean well well you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. Um well okay um um. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but okay like I mean so okay they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging okay you know like um you know your view of a player but we did learn some things some players had uh okay like well okay much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
