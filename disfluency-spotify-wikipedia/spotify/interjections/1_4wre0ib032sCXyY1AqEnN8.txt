Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough okay issues or try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough like of that going on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration okay behind this podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories you know that being real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. So. Actually, it's quite the opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to like continue to grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a um reminder that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when well our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
