Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you want so I mean so like so to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that Madison Pruitt uh so uh um well with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description and I like uh uh you know okay along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be so like so I mean so 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's I mean well uh you know okay leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after um you know I mean okay um production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of well um so well so this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. Uh um um uh I mean. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have okay um you know I mean okay other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've you know so you know okay okay got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I okay you know you know okay so just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out on this channel um well like well um and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific so like I mean um like on AfterBuzz TV.
