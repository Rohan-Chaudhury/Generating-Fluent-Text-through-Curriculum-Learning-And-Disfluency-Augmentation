So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I um okay well well uh like okay uh okay I mean have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I I mean like like I mean like I mean um um um okay had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it I mean um you know okay I mean um so you know um well can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this you know okay so well you know you know you know uh uh you know pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know better well uh you know so okay so well I mean um I mean than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop you know so so well well you know so so I mean like and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me so very so okay okay um like uh okay I mean um well profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so powerful that um I mean I mean you know I mean um like you know okay I mean he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
