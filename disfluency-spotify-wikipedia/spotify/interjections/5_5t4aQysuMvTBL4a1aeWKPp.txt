From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian Morgan's. This is well um I mean like uh the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today we're looking at I mean uh um I mean uh one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th century. It's a story about uh okay so I mean um for men and for women who are locked inside this enormous glass dome for two years um okay like so uh just to see what would happen. And as you'd imagine it all went a so uh I mean so you know little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started to get a bit uncomfortable rarely um you know um um I mean about the four to six month Mark. I think we all knew instinctively that if ever um okay um like I mean anybody opened up physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
