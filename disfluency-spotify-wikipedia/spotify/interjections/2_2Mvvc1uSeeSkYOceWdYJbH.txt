But anyways, uh I mean I've been watching Love is Blind within the Pilar alert. Oh, yeah. I don't give uh um a fuck. I'm mad. Anyways, me and my girlfriend had been watching it for the um um past two days. We were up till like o'clock in the morning. I love so you know Cameron and Lauren. I'm emotionally invested in the two of them. Hey, she just she just okay so spilled her drink her water everywhere. Anyways, I'm emotionally invested in Cameron and Lauren. Although I like um do think Cameron. He gets a little bit whiny sometimes he's a little he just he's well I mean very emotional. He's a very emotional man and but but he loves her very well well much. However today we made it to the last episode. We have not seen Cameron and Lauren's wedding yet, but.
