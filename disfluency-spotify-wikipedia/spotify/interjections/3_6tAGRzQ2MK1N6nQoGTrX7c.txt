Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through um well so a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying like I mean you know down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can okay um okay also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure uh so I mean that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you have uh well like your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet well um uh Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either okay like I mean you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find like you know uh your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
