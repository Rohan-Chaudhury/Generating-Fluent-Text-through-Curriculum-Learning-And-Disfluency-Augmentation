He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other I mean uh religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to reinvent religion like you know for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while listening okay well to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I highly um uh recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the speakers in um um my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead like well of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's you know okay only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because okay um I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
