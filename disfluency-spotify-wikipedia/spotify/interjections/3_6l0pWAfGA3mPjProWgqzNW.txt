Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may like you know uh ask that is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven so okay like years old Nate nasty couple of nicknames. He had gotten Natan a sty Fergus I mean um uh Ace Qbert Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and so um so I assure you I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years but uh I mean well the reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because he has a uh um so propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four weeks at a okay like uh time or maybe even a couple days when I get my sad boy moments. Like um okay. I'm talking six months to a year. This man can disappear at times. He has um well uh a lot of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
