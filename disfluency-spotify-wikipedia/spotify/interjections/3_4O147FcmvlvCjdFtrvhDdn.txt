Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you want uh uh like to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that Madison you know you know you know Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the I mean well so description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was so uh uh certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because so I mean well Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get so um I mean this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so um I mean so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is you know so okay there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But um um okay as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Like okay like. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's so like so all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to you know so I mean Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check uh you know okay that out on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after you know so like show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
