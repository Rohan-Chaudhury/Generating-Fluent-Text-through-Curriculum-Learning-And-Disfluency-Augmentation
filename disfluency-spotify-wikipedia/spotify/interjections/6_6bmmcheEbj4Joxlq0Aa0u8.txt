At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a Southern state flooding okay like so so okay you know most of the many counties since the water was about six feet deep outside and okay well so I mean uh like inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof watching the wreckage Float you know okay well uh I mean um by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw Hat as it went um uh so you know um like downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who lost that hat is very sorry I mean uh like I mean well um now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around the corner of the house uh okay uh um okay so the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat so like I mean like so uh floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very strange. So the lad kept his you know okay so you know okay you know eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of the house and came like uh well uh well like floating back down again after a while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding well okay you know you know like I mean the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
