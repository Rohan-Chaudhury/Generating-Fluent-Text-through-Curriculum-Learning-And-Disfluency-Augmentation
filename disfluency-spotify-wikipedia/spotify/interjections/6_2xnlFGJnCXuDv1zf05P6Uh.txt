What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the um um um okay you know I mean gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid well I mean okay uh well um model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a uh okay okay uh uh well financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third row you know you know you know okay well you know podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and we're well so like uh uh so talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's well um well well you know okay like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new uh you know uh you know uh so tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then like well um you know uh well you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake well um uh okay um well pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten okay like okay um um I mean some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like okay so like you know like like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance uh like um well uh um Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort okay you know well um you know you know of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package well well um I mean uh um is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
