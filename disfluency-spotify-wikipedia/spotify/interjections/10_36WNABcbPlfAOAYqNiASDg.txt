If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show uh um you know I mean like I mean um um so uh notes in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened you know you know well uh you know uh uh uh um like it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you okay okay well so okay like well you know so like saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that uh like um um uh um like okay so like habit of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And so okay. Uh okay uh well I mean well so well you know like. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels and we so well you know um well you know like you know so okay want to remind you that that there is a stream of well-being which um you know like I mean I mean so um like like um you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever well you know well like okay like like um okay um reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that stream um you know you know uh um uh okay you know okay okay of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so you is okay I mean um well you know um like so you know uh so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
