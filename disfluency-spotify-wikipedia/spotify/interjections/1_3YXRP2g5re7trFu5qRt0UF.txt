It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that um you know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have like a conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here like to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's so like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you um know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was so enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways you know to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless you know that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
