Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week late. Well you know uh uh uh you know. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to New like like I mean well I mean so Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a lot like um you know okay I mean um of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after um you know you know you know okay well but I had so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go um um um well I mean okay get my pap. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people that okay uh so you know like okay I see in a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying uh so so like uh like in New Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here and I mean um okay you know I mean so nephews and it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my house so so uh um well uh and no one's here right now, which is kind of rare. So I'm trying okay okay uh well um uh to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
