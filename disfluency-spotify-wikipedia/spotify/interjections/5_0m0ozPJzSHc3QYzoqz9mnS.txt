The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were you know okay so okay so friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how well um like you know um we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you um okay like I mean well know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have you know uh well so you know had when we first started out this would have been way way easier and it's I mean okay like you know okay much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor so you know I mean I mean like is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you I mean I mean so uh like need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy I mean like so uh um recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it okay okay okay okay you know on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the well you know so you know uh creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you well uh uh so like know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
