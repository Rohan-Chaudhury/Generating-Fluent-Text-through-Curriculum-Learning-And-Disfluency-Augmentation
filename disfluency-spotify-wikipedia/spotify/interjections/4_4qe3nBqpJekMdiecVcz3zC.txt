Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and I mean uh um I mean the topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What okay okay you know like kind of interesting email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my I mean I mean well so work and telling me how just in a short period of time. He's in well uh well you know a situation where I guess his he's been married. And he's in the so I mean okay I mean process of getting a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He um like you know I mean found out she was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the like like like um interesting thing is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, so well um like but the interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife you know you know you know uh without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
