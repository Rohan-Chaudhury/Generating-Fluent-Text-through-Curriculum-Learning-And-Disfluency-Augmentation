Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if so okay um so you know you know well you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that Madison um um uh uh uh well well Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description well okay like uh like uh you know and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly you know um you know like um um um going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley um uh um you know so like like was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie um uh okay okay well uh you know was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so so uh well um you know you know you know she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there uh well well like um um so any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as you know um I mean you know uh uh you know of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let uh like okay uh uh uh so me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got for okay like you know you know so you know well today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just uh so um you know I mean you know you know did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out on this well you know well well so uh okay channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight so like uh I mean like okay well at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV.
