Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be well um so well I mean going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to I mean you know uh so um be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your so I mean okay so like sides. You can also do this in a seated position. If you I mean okay well um I mean are sitting you want to make sure that your back is flat up against like well like well so your chair or a wall if you have your legs crossed and if you are you know like I mean uh uh sitting in a chair have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. I mean you know well uh uh. So once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I mean um okay you know uh I want you to find your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and well like um like you know then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
