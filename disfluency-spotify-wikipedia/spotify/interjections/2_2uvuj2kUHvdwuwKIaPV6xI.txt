July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year well you know old came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez like uh over dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over I mean like San Jose the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic um well as it seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with I mean um Heroin just like most nights but right away something felt different. It was all uh like wrong. The drugs burned hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever like you know experienced before he began to hallucinate and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
