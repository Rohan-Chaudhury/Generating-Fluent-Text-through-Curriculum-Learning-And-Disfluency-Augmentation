Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I guess you know there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that I had I mean a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little bit um the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. It is difficult well to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here towards the like end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 following it okay says this and the evening of that first day of the week when you know the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus um came and stood among them and said peace be with you after he said this okay he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
