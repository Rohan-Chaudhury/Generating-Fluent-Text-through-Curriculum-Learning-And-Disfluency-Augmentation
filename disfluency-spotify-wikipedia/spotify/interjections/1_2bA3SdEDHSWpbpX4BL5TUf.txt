well, hello guys, welcome to the first episode of the haven't we thought of a okay name yet? I was want to do breakfast at Perkins given my last like name kind of lame. But but then I was told that people may think you know that breakfast at Perkins. Could have some potential copyright with you know, the actual restaurant program, like so I might do breakfast with Perkins. I don't know. Anyway, how we like doing? How's everyone doing? I figured I would start a podcast. Maybe to help kind of um supplement my thoughts that I have on other social media platforms whether it be Snapchat Facebook like Instagram. What have you first let me apologize. I just ate Indian food so and it's stuck in my throat. First off. Let me give a shout out to India star. You never been to India star.
