It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels you know like well um within a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every well um I mean well living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood well um okay you know glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is um like so I mean the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the um so okay I mean pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if well well like well the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the well okay um so bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose well uh well like into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored I mean so well um for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
