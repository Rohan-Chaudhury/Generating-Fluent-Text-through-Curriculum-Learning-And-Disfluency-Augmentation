He had like um um um uh like you know well chosen after his suffering. He presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs like I mean uh so okay okay um you know that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of 40 days and okay so uh I mean um like well well spoke about the kingdom of God on one occasion while he was eating with them he gave them this And do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for.
