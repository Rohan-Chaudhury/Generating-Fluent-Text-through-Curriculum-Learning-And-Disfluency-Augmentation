Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very well traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of I mean my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. So. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the okay small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the well lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than I mean traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a I mean great shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see uh movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
