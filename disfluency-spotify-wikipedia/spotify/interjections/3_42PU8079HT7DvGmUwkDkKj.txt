Good morning, everyone Welcome to our Friday spending time with Jesus podcast today. I wanted um uh I mean us to look at Romans chapter 1 the entire book of Romans is jam-packed with you know well uh Theology and interesting thoughts and just like amazing Epic. Ders that people quote all the so you know you know time and Romans chapter 1 is really no different and Romans 1 we're dealing with okay well I mean our sexuality. We're dealing with idolatry. We're dealing with the question of is the well so uh law of God really written on the human heart no matter where they're at. You know I mean I mean. No matter where they've grown up or what they've heard all their lives and so so well it's an incredible chapter it lists out all the ways that we can act basically in like well uh sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that.
