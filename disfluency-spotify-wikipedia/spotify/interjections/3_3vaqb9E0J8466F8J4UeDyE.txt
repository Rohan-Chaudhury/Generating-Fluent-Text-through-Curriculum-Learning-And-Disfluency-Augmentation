Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if okay uh okay you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that uh well you know Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the like okay you know description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly you know so so going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was okay okay you know announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something so I mean like weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be so okay you know the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming so you know okay this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all well you know uh have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's like I mean so all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new um so I mean to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. You know um I mean. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor uh like um after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
