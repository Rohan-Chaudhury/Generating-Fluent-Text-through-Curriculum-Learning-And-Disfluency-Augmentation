extraordinary women the podcast presenting extraordinary stories by ordinary women from Munich So uh so uh so well so I'm procedure right? I am South African and I've been living in Munich for um uh okay okay um like almost seven and a half years and I'm currently an energy therapist but okay um like like okay I mean most of my focus goes into a trauma Survivor community that I I mean uh well you know like like started just over a year ago. It was really interesting because I grew up like okay uh I mean uh uh under the time of Apartheid. And so I grew up thinking that how I lived I mean you know uh so well you know was normal. I remember hearing Nelson Mandela's name for the first time when I was 9 years old.
