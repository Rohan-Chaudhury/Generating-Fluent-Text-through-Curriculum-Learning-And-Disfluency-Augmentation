Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining well so I mean to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine to um um like determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an okay I mean I mean important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their well well uh Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control you know you know okay of what they would like and as a man this is important to uh well well your success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you well uh uh want to become a man of value so that way other men or I mean so so other people in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So you know um so here's the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a like so uh person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going okay you know uh to do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little bit to well okay so explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten um so well minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
