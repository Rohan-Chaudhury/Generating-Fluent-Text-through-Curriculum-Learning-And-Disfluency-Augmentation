It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small range well well like so um okay like well Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. You know so um you know okay I mean you know okay. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood uh well well I mean so uh like uh glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, like um okay so uh you know uh like which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows um I mean like I mean so uh okay so through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose I mean I mean uh uh like um okay so if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into like I mean you know um so well um well the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert you know okay uh okay like um um like the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble okay uh well okay um you know you know I mean and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects okay uh uh like uh I mean okay okay a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
