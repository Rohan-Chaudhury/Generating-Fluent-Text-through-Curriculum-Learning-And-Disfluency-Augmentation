It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that okay well you know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. Okay um. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just like so here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So uh so it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, like so you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it you know so was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. I mean I mean. Meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter you know um can be totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool uh well and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
