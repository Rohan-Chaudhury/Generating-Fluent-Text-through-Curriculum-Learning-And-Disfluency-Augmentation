Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on um well like okay I mean you know the John Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred so uh you know uh like you know twenty seven cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and um okay like so like um in the United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. Well like I mean well um okay. 102 cases confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we okay so like you know okay I mean haven't had any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look I mean okay so like uh well going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
