Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get like like okay I mean so well so um a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I well um well I mean uh you know I mean okay forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. So you know um you know I mean like you know I mean. I just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. You know like okay I mean um so so like. Like when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry well well you know so you know I mean okay well when I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times well um um uh uh um okay you know as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. I mean well so so so well well well. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand uh uh I mean so uh okay um you know out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to be like like uh okay like uh uh like or when it will be but it just happens after you listen well so um so uh um uh um to it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug well um okay well well uh I mean well in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach your I mean I mean so uh so uh you know so already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or little okay um okay you know uh um well okay hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
