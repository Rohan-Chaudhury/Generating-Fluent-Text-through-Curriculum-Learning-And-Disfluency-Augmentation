The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that you know uh so uh okay you know so like were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me um uh well you know like so like like how we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And well well okay like like uh okay well you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would like I mean I mean um um uh okay so have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier like you know like I mean okay so I mean okay and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is you know well I mean uh um um like well by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. You know like I mean you know uh uh well so. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording like like like uh uh so um well equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on your phone I mean so so I mean uh okay you know I mean right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the creation tools. So um like I mean like so okay I mean. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if we didn't you know so so I mean well like um I mean have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
