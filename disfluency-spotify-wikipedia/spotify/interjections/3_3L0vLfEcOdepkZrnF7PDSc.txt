Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week um well so late. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to New you know so like Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a lot of I mean um you know stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after but I had so much so okay you know shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. Smear I have um like okay errands to run I was linking with people that I see in a while. Um like like. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New Orleans and my I mean so um mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and it be loud well I mean you know like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my house and no one's here um uh um right now, which is kind of rare. So I'm trying to record before somebody try um okay you know to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
