Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining to you know uh um so well each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine to determine your okay well um uh you know fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an important topic is I mean like you know I mean you know because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny or how to actually you know I mean uh you know I mean control their fate so that way they're in control of what they like so um I mean so would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is ridiculously well well like like so important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to become a man of I mean so so I mean um value so that way other men or other people in general can lean on you. Like okay like well um. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If you don't so well well like like have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit there um well like I mean so and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very well. Okay, I mean you know uh well I mean because this video might take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen uh well like okay uh grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
