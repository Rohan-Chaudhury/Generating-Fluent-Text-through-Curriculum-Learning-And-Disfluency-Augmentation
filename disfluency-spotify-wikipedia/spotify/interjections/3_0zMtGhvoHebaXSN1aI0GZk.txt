It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a you know um you know small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living I mean so you know cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if well like like blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, so I mean um which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows like so so through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a I mean you know okay high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the uh I mean uh pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence okay uh okay of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form um so like of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues I mean um I mean until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
