So this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and man. You know okay you know. There are some nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear well okay so it. If this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. You know okay um. Going back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think I mean um uh that all of the information in part to her story all her tips the I mean uh okay way that she parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost uh so um more like valuable when you know where she came from part 1 is all about so well okay her life as a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her okay I mean well as a young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
