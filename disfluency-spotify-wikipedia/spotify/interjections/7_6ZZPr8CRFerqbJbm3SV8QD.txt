Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting like okay so I mean okay okay I mean as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of um uh well like um um uh life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And well uh well okay you know so okay I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the so uh you know well uh well you know sounds of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath uh um I mean you know I mean um okay the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You okay okay so I mean like well um make me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
