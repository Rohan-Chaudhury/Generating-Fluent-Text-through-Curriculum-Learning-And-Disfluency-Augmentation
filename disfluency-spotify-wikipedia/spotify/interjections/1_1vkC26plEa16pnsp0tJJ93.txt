Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to so leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on I mean Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest um some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to talk okay about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I know I um said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot freak so out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're / like okay fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view of a like player but we did learn some things some players had much better showing than others. Um. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
