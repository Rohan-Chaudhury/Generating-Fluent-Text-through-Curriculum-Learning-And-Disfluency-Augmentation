together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how I mean I mean you know Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets so I mean like up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God um well uh to be with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be I mean you know I mean with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter well okay well comes to him and he says to him we've been looking for you and I mean um um Jesus says while I needed to be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. Um uh um. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude like I mean I mean of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being with God the father well okay I mean in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
