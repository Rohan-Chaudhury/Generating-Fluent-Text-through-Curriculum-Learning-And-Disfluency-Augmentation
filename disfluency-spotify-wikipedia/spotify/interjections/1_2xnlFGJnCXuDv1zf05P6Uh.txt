What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the well gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid so model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a um financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third row so podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and we're so talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's like a um $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours uh for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay so five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads you know which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten uh some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like okay wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to okay upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and okay like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what I well think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
