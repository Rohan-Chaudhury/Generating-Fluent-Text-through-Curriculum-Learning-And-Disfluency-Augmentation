Hello guys and welcome to the fifth episode of The Forgotten podcast. My name uh is Kiran Krishnan. And today I'm joined with swayam and moanin and we hear well talk about something that is kind of alien to me. I am not very I'm uh very informed on this and it is Anime so guys educate me. Okay, Karen tell me uh something. Have you watched Pok√©mon? Yes here on there. Yes, you washed Beyblade. Yes, and it okay was a culture. Where back where? I when I when we grew up so we should you know just hang around and you know oracle 3 2 1 let it rip or like whatever, right? Yeah. So yeah, it was a throwback and nostalgic moment. Yes, I have uh so everyone has actually watched anime when they were kids. They just don't realize it. So you know it's like shows Pokemon Digimon and Doraemon Shin-chan Ninja Hattori. They're all enemies now that I think about it. Beyblade was The Craze back when we were in.
