We're recording this you know you know like well like okay so you know well um on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to well um so um um I mean uh um um um digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're well well uh like well well you know well um you know going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. Um uh okay uh um so I mean well uh you know. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have well you know so well I mean um so uh um uh to reiterate you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. Um well you know like like so uh so I mean you know. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just okay okay uh so uh I mean like okay um okay an example, but they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make well like okay you know I mean so uh okay um I mean you wildly swinging your view of a player but we did learn some things some uh so so like you know okay um uh um uh players had much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
