My name is Celine and I am your host okay uh you know for this podcast. I want to issue a Proviso at the beginning of the Podcast which I mean uh you know is that this is absolutely not a substitute for professional mental health and medical so uh so intervention. So, please seek out those sources of support if you need them. And so so you know I also want to mention that I will be discussing topics such as self-harm and suicidal ideation.
