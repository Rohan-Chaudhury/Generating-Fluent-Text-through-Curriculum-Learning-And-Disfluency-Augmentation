Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very like I mean traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of I mean you know my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, it you know well was so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on the table so you know next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I also uh you know realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't do much I mean I mean damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first thing I tried was like so to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral vision. They got uh I mean closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
