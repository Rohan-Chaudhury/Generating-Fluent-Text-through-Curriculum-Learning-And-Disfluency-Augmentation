He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and so um you know I mean uh like I mean other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to so okay well well um so uh reinvent religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit well like I mean you know okay so you know a friend while listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, so um like so okay so you know which I highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the well well okay I mean you know okay so speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So I mean okay okay I mean like so you know instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when you know like uh so okay you know I mean it's only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
