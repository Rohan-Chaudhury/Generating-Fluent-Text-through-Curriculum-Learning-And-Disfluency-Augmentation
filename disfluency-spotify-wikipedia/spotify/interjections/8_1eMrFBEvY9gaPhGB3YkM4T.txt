Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was like well like you know I mean um okay okay very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in you know okay okay so uh like like you know front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. So well okay well well I mean well you know. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small okay you know okay well so uh I mean I mean lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights you know you know you know like you know like I mean so here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing like so like okay I mean well so uh me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. Um well well well I mean you know uh well. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see like like so so um uh I mean I mean movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
