Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking well to you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. I mean. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money um you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your um professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many questions uh from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is our well time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So here uh we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 well years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I am but uh it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their okay families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and well can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
