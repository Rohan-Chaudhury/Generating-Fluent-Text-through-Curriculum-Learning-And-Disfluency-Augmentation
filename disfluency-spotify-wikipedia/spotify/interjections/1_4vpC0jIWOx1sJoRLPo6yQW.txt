So the time is probably going to come when I delete all these episodes uh right? I think so. I don't want to just let it sit here if I'm not so using it, but what's happening today why I'm talking to you today is because it's uh warm out. I think it's in the 50s to me. This is warm when outside well was still wearing a light down coat. Had all my stuff with me as so most New Yorkers do we're always carrying stuff. Just taking out the trash. Too warm All I mean right. Someone's actually letting me cross. I'm shocked. Thank you. Almost got killed by I mean someone before crossing the street. Thank you for being polite. So I was too hot. Um. I came downstairs light down coat scarf in my bag too hot went back up put.
