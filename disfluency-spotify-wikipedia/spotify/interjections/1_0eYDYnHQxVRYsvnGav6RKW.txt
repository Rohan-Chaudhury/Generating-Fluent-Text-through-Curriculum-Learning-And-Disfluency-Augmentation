All right, I hate doing this but we got to pay the bills and I okay don't know how you're listening to this podcast right now. Thank you for listening by you know the way, but if you haven't heard about anchor it's the easiest way to um make a podcast. I know everybody's been locked up during this quarantine and a okay few people have reached out to me and asked for advice on how to I mean get their podcast started or distribute it out there and anchors the best way like to do it. It's free. There's creation tools that allow you to record and edit okay the podcast, right? Your phone or your computer? You can have your fans leave messages. I mean. Thank you to those of you that have been doing that by the way, you know keep them come and keep harassing us and anchor will distribute the podcast for you um and can be heard on Spotify Apple podcasts and a bunch more this so like many channels that are podcast is on some of them. I never I mean even heard of so it does the work for you and you can make money from your podcast with no minimum listenership. You can just hit the ground running.
