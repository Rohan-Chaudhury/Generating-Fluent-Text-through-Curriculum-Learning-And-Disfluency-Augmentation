Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If you so you know um you know um um like follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know that well I mean well uh okay um I mean I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of well so okay well okay so well God. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking at real you know you know okay I mean like okay like life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using and speaking very um um um well like so uh specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart behind this is that so so like uh okay okay uh as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously avoid but we um like like okay um uh I mean will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. I am so um uh um uh like uh you know convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
