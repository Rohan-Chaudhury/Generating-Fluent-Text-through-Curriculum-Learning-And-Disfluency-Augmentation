Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing um so okay like uh okay um uh you know had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he you know you know you know so like you know so you know you know do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? like okay like like so you know um you know uh Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else okay so I mean I mean so I mean I mean uh you know had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially you know uh you know um uh um like so you know when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be um I mean um um okay I mean well so you know in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to um I mean like uh so um like okay like have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is I mean so well I mean so um I mean so so chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
