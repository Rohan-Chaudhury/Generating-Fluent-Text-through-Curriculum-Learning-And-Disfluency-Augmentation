I nursing students, it's Dean terpil. And this is the Enterprise podcast. Today is Friday, so March 6th 2020. I wanted to touch base with all of you because it um feels like there's been a lot going on this week, even though we've been on uh spring break. I usually only send an email with a link to the theory courses. So like if you have a friend or relative a classmate who's in the in your clinical like group, but not your theory class. Please pass this information on to them or tell well them to contact me so I can send them the link. This is important information okay that I want all of you to have. It's going to be even more important um than usual for us to be in communication for you to have good communication with I mean the nursing program over the next several weeks. You need to get in the habit uh of checking your BC email. You need to check any messages in D2L frequently things could change rapidly as things have changed rapidly over the.
