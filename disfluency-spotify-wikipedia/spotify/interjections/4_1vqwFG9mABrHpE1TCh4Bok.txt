Hello, you lovely bunch and welcome back to yes, another episode of the vitalife show so like uh you know me Tori and Me Myself and Irene. I have nobody on this podcast and well I mean um like there's a good reason for it. I also just want to say if uh um well so the sound quality sound slightly different. I do apologize. I haven't got my headphones and well well you know I mean that is because I am currently in the middle of moving so I have packed my you know I mean well okay whole life up not thinking that I needed me. Fines and I'm in the middle of um you know uh well a hotel because I also started a new job last week. And yeah, it's all um um uh I mean decided to come at once. But the reason I actually chose to do this you know like like you know podcast and do this by myself is because it's something that I want to uh okay um I mean talk to you about just from my own personal experience for once to okay like uh okay a perfectly honest, obviously with being mental health months and the last couple of episodes to kind of touching on Mental Health.
