In the year leading up to the 2020 election. We're counting down the biggest okay like um scandals in American political history. This is number 36 Carol Hubbard Junior. The former Congressman okay well so was charged with three felonies after illegally using his campaign fund and Congressional staff well I mean well for personal use 56 year old former Congressman Carol Hubbard Junior thought he was getting well uh uh ready to participate in a sting mission for the FBI the past few well like you know years on the hill had been tough for him pesky Agents from the bureau had um well well been poking around his Finance records. They were definitely looking for something no matter Hubbard you know well I mean thought he'd outrun his cooked books with a little quid pro quo. He could okay like you know play nice for a couple months and help the FBI. Investigate lobbying in Libya, then they'd see he was worth his salt.
