Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with your so you know I mean host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for tuning well so okay in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why so you know so when and how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to me, let so well I mean me at least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for um I mean uh about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. I started off so you know okay at a nursing home from there. I was able to go into a you know okay so clinic Uncle setting working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the so like okay Private Practice World, which is really where I wanted to be I was able to sit with so so so people for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were able I mean okay so to see each other for a bit more than five or ten minutes um uh okay and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes well uh uh in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've been uh I mean like here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
