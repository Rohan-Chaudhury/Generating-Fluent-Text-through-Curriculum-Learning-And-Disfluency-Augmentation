This is your everyday positivity here on Vale. Hello. I'm Kate Crocker. I hope you know you're well today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough? I had a moment um this week with my coach about accountability and I was really surprised. It's always really surprising um when you think I've got that bit sorted and I'm always really good at so that and then someone asks you a question and you go always like that. I well think I'm good at that or the time actually good at that so I um have been challenged this week and And it's hard. It's hard pushing yourself through those so challenges. It feels uncomfortable you get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and you so your instinct says right. I need to move away from this. I don't want to um go there t harv Eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets easy like when you do the hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard okay stuff. So something is really challenging you at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
