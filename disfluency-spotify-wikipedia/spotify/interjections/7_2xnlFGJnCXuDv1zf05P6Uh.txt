What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the I mean okay uh you know okay like you know gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S um um um okay uh I mean I mean and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really I mean I mean so okay you know well I mean really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on uh okay okay so okay you know um this shout out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. You know like like so so I mean so. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that okay um okay okay I mean well I mean came out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can so I mean I mean okay um well so basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 uh you know um I mean uh well uh which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more okay uh well I mean like um like for these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform um uh you know you know um so okay better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool you know um so you know um you know so thing. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla well so well you know well uh um as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features um well well um you know okay um and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love okay uh well uh so you know I mean and the track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
