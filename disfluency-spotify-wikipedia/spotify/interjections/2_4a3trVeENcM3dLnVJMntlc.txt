A single sardine cannot do much on its own accord. However, it has been told you know you know I have read that back in the day a massive School of sardines underneath like uh the Golden Gate Bridge was powerful enough. Enough a school of sardines was powerful um I mean enough together to force a large boat to stop in its tracks and push well I mean it the other way tile friends. If you want to change for better in uh um this industry, if you want higher prices, if you wish people respected you more as a tile contractor, we have got to band together and unitedly turn this ship around.
