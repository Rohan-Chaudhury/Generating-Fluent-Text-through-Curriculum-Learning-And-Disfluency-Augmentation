I am South African and I've been living in Munich for almost well you know so seven and a half years and I'm currently an energy therapist but most of my focus goes like okay like into a trauma Survivor community that I started just over a year ago.

I remember hearing Nelson Mandela's name for the first time when I was 9 years old.
