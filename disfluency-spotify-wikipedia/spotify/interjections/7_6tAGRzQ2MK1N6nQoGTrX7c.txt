Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going um you know you know you know okay um you know through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be you know okay uh you know I mean um you know laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. I mean well I mean I mean uh okay like. You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you so well okay um okay you know like want to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or I mean you know I mean okay like okay so a wall if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in um so you know I mean well uh okay a chair have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your so uh I mean I mean well you know you know knees. So once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I mean I mean like um you know so um I want you to find your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and well well uh you know um okay I mean then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
