He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and um uh like like other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to well okay um I mean reinvent religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while listening I mean like so um to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I so I mean uh so highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the speakers okay okay like so in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead of Music so um I mean like I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's only coming out I mean like so um of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
