Greetings, this is Douglas. Gimple senior portfolio specialist at Diamond Hill Capital Management. And uh this is understanding Edge. It's been a pretty crazy week and a half in uh the markets. We reached out last week with three podcasts covering domestic International uh equities as well as fixed income, but given how things ended the week. I you know thought it would be beneficial to get our chief investment officer for fixed income bills okay aux-in. To discuss what he saw over the last week and a half thoughts on like the FED Palace comments from Friday and where we're headed and what we're okay looking to do in this type of volatile environment. Hope you enjoy this. Thank you um very much and enjoy Film the last seven trading sessions stocks as measured by you know the S&P 500 are down close to 13 percent while high-yield as measured by the ice BofA high-yield index.
