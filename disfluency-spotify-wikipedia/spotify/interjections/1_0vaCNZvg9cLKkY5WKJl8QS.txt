Hey everybody. Welcome to Mom Hood, it's Wednesday. We're so glad that you're here. Okay. I hope you guys are having a beautiful week. We are stoked because today well is part 2 of the October Gonzalez interview and we have been absolutely okay dying to release this one. So this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood well and man. There are some nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys I mean to hear it. If this is the first one that you're tapping on I do so recommend. Going back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But okay I do think that all of the information in part to her story all her uh tips the way that she parents it's all like so much more interesting and well almost more like valuable when you know where she came from part 1 is all you know about her life as a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic okay her as a young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
