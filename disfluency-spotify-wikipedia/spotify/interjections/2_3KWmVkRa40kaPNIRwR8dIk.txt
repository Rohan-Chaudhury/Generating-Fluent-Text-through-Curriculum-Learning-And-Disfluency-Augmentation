Hi, welcome to you were taught that in school episode 1 taxes, everyone always so I mean writes after they get out of school about how they couldn't do their like I mean taxes and how they wish school and taught them to do their taxes. And like okay why didn't somebody teach them do their taxes what you were taught that in school. It's I mean you know called basic math in first grade or 2nd grade. They taught you how to add and I mean um subtract numbers. That's how you do taxes. You line them up in a column you add some I mean so together, you subtract some the Part about that is you were taught how to okay you know follow directions. There's directions at the top of the paper. You were supposed okay like to read them. You read those directions and you follow them. So you were taught like uh that in school that was in elementary school the fact that you can't follow directions so you know and do simple math doesn't mean that you weren't taught that in school. It just uh so means that you can't do simple math or follow directions. This has been you we're taught that in school episode 1. See you next week.
