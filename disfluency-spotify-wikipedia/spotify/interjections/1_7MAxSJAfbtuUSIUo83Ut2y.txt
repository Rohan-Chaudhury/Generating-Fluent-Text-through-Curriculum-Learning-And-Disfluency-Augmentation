As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and uh a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was I mean a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the roof. We um had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably a fire you know hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number one problem and really so it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there were Current objects of pleasure. Uh. I guess you could say I'm not too sure what is safe for the so radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but also objects to practice safe sex okay like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth like State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of um pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
