So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And uh uh like um yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach um okay you know like because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard like so okay uh it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into so well um okay this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know um so well you know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop uh uh uh uh and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me um like I mean you know so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so so well um like powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
