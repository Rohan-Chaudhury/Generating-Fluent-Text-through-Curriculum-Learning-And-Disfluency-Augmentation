Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or uh well well so try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going uh so um you know on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast okay I mean um like is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being real like I mean you know um being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the okay you know uh um opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to grow okay um so okay through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder so okay you know uh that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when I mean okay well um our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
