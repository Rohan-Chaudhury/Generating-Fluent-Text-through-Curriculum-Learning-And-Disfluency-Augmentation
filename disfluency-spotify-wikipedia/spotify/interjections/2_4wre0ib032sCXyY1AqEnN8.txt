Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or try to okay um create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going on in the I mean okay world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast is to speak to um so and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being real being vulnerable and being okay so true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the opposite. We believe that true like like strength is revealed through our ability to continue to grow through our struggle and we well so want this podcast to serve as a reminder that in our Darkest Hours when um I mean we can't see the way out when our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
