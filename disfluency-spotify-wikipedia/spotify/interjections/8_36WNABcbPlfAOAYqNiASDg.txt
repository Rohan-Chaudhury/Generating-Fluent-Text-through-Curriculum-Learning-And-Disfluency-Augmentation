If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes okay I mean um you know um um um um in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened it. You know well like you know well well so uh. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you saying I mean I mean you know so okay okay I mean so all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that I mean um uh you know like okay like like habit of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And so uh you know I mean okay um okay I mean um okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels and we want well uh well so I mean um okay so to remind you that that there is a stream of well-being which you are allowing or I mean I mean okay so like like you know so not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason are standing okay so okay well uh uh you know you know in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that stream of well-being I mean okay uh you know um I mean like um because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so you is so so uh okay uh so well okay so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
