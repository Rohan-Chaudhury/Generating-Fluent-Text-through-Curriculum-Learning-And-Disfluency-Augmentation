Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly weekly podcast okay so well uh like and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as so far you know so like you know uh and want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made a mistake uh so you know okay I mean on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she put out and um I mean like well you know about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it that I you know um um like you know said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but You know so okay you know you know like my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
