Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. Okay uh I mean like um um. If you follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will um you know okay um well um know that I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the you know you know like um well so word of God. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will so okay so so well well be looking at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll I mean like well so like okay be using and speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart you know so okay I mean I mean uh behind this is that as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously so I mean um like um okay avoid but we will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. Like okay so I mean well like. I am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word I mean um I mean so uh so of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
