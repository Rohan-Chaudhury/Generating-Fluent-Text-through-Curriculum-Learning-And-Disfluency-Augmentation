Usually I wait to reflect on my guest and work on the introduction for Saturday well mornings. There's no sleeping in my house because we have a puppy and he likes like to get up really early. But today's a little bit different. I keep thinking about uh our guest. Mrs. Whitman's story. I know her story is going to resonate with so many um of you out there. I want you to listen. This one all the way okay through. If you don't know. Mrs. Whitman, you're going to know her pretty well at um the end of this half hour episode this half hour goes by fast. Now. I uh know this sounds like a Shameless plug but it isn't please share the episode like people need to hear her story. They need to hear about her I mean resiliency. They need to hear about how she weather's so many different storms that have uh taken place in her life. Thanks for listening. Please let me know what you think write a review.
