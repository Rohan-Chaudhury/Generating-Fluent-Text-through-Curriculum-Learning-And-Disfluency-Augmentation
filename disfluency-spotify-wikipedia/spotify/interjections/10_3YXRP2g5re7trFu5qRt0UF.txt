So okay so okay okay I mean so so okay uh. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to you know you know uh okay I mean okay you know well well like serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's like uh you know um like I mean uh um okay you know okay we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know was I mean well so you know okay um you know like uh I mean a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because we so okay like uh okay well you know um so like just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make so you know you know uh uh well um um uh um you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that it's okay I mean like you know so I mean well well uh like just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
