Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you I mean I mean so I mean know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire life. That uh so um you know there's something wrong with this world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you crazy.
