Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing okay uh well um I mean had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is I mean uh so you know well he do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you well I mean I mean uh I mean do? Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels okay you know you know I mean I mean bought everything else had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you uh so like okay you know have to learn especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where like uh you know uh um I meant to be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So uh you know you know okay okay I do need to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting like like so uh well up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
