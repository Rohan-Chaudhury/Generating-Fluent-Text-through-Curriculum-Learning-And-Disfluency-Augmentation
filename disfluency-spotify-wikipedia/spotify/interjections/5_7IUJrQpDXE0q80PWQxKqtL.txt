Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about the mentorship okay like okay like okay group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor like well like uh you know to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often okay well like I mean like finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we um like you know you know so do find them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive or okay well well you know uh they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 okay so okay okay I mean years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking I mean well like so um a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help more so you know you know like well people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be able uh I mean okay you know I mean to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me questions like I mean like well okay anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction of the cost that so like so you know I mean this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
