It was just a lot I mean okay um uh you know of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after but um uh you know okay like I had so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get um um um okay so my pap. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people so like well well um that I see in a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying like um you know um like in New Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here and so uh okay like um nephews and it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my so I mean I mean like okay house and no one's here right now, which is kind of rare. So I'm trying so okay I mean so like to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
