Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing I mean you know you know like okay I mean like I mean had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he do I mean uh okay well uh I mean I mean well you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, I mean uh well um uh well um uh it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl um like um well you know you know so you know duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing um like so well okay I mean so I mean gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be in I mean I mean okay I mean um so uh well three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have like uh um uh so uh you know I mean ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is um um I mean okay uh um I mean like chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
