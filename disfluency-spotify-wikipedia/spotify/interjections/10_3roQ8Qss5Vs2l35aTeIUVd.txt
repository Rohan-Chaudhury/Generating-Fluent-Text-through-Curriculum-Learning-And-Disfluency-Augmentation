Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things uh you know okay okay uh so I mean I mean you know I mean well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that you know so like okay you know I mean I mean you know I mean I mean the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us so um so I mean like okay so um well you know in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a so so well like I mean okay um so um like couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and so uh I mean I mean okay you know I mean okay you know you know dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting like okay you know so you know like uh like uh I mean that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed okay I mean okay okay like well uh I mean like I mean to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on um you know um um you know uh well well like okay the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll so um like uh um you know like um okay you know tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
