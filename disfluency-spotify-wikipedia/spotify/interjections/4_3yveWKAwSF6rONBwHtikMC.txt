Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had um well you know you know girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he so okay I mean you know do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? well like um well Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had well like uh uh girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially I mean well okay um when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be um like uh like in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do so well you know so need to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with um um um um whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
