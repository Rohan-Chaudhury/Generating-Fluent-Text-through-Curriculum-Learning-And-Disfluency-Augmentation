Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard towards like okay um okay like Ascension. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I am joined by uh um you know I mean like terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream speakers like like like so like in another episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I thought it might so like I mean uh uh be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I am doing so you know uh well well fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the woo Kang like uh okay uh like now we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about the uh okay so I mean uh Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it where um uh uh um I mean he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours wasn't quite um okay like like so enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer time okay I mean you know like okay and North American summer time do not occur at the same time. So I'm like, let's like um like well uh figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm like I mean um so like okay 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I can wake up um well like I mean I mean at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
