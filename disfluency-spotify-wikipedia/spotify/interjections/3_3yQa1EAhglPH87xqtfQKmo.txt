Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the like well um topic of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This so you know uh is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the um um uh reality is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not um I mean uh always going to feel like things are going to work out in your favor. Um well well. You're not always going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday so okay um is going to be really great and you're going to be full of well um so passion and feel inspired. And other days it's going to feel uh like uh hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially um okay well if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling okay um okay you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you you know well so want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for um well um you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
