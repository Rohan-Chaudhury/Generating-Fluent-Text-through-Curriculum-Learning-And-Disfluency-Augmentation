Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about the well well I mean like mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor uh you know okay so to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too so well uh like often finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we so like uh uh do find them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive well you know I mean like or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over well you know you know um 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've like um like well been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help uh um okay you know more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be okay well I mean um able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask um well um you know me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction um okay I mean like of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
