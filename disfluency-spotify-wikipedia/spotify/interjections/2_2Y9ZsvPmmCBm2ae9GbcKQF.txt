Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope okay uh you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode starts. I so you know just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this podcast is well I mean called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought you I mean okay know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know catch up so uh with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded the past few um you know episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme of this you know uh podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the things that well well we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and things okay so we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So with that said the I mean uh new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I finally figure well uh out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up is I mean well going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them share you know so what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
