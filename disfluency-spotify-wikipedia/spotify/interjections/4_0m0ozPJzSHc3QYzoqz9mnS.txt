The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were um uh I mean well friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how um you know well I mean we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you uh uh I mean so know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have you know you know okay you know had when we first started out this would have been way way easier and uh so um like it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is well you know I mean like by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you so you know uh well everything you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or I mean okay I mean I mean any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and well okay well um edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all I mean uh well I mean the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you um so okay so know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
