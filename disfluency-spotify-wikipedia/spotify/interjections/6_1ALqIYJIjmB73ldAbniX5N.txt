This is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's okay you know you know I mean you know uh begin in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen. It's you know well uh like like I mean called a mind all those who promise to pray for Hope is the theological I mean you know so okay okay I mean virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness um okay so well um I mean placing all our trust in Christ promises and relying not on our own you know you know well I mean I mean well strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit, So you know uh I mean you know well uh with hope we strive for Holiness we strive to become a saint as something like well like um uh uh which is possible but not yet guaranteed. And there are three conditions needed for the okay so well you know um I mean virtue of Hope first and active pursuit of God Holiness in heaven second, the realization that the attainment of Holiness in heaven is possible.
