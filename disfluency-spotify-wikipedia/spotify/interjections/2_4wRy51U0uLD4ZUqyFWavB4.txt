Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I am too but I'm trying well um to pretend I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this podcast episode set so like up because my microphone I feel like it's only really good for one person and okay uh that I feel like our audio is always a little off and you guys I mean well have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it we're probably going to have like like to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome to yeah, we said it with so um me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time tuning in. This is a mother-daughter uh um podcast where we answer your life advice questions that you emailed to me and Miss I mean uh thing at gmail.com. And I would say it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
