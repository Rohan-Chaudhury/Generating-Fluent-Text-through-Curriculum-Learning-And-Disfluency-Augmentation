Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I have just uh I mean so well so so you know well you know some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk about like so well I mean uh well uh I mean okay uh life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica uh so I mean like okay you know um like like Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have to say well I mean you know well well uh I mean okay so anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell me if um um you know well well uh um I mean like you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back home so you know I mean so um you know so well I mean - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. Uh so uh so well I mean um well okay. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just to see if like so okay like uh uh you know um um people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when I read I mean um like uh uh um okay okay well this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram because uh uh um uh well I mean I mean well well I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
