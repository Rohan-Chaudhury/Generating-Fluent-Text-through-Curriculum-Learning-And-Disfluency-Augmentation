Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out okay uh well okay you know I mean if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I okay well like so I mean so reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link so uh I mean so okay um in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie so I mean I mean you know so well was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley okay I mean um I mean I mean you know was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was uh okay so I mean so um filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so um okay okay uh well I mean she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any well um I mean you know you know so other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right you know you know you know like you know okay now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know uh um um um so um your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News uh um so I mean you know um Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive uh um uh so like I mean on her earlier today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you um you know I mean well I mean so check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV.
