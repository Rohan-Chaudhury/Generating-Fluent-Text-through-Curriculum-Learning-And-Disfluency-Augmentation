Welcome back to emerge today's guest probably needs no introduction. For those of you who okay okay have been following the podcast for some time as speaking with Robert Keegan Robert or Bob you know um Keegan. It has a long history of working in the field of adult development. So so. And if you're not familiar with Bob's work, you will be after listening to okay uh this show. We do a kind of Action to his work an overview of so like the 5 stage model that he created and that has been studied empirically for like well the last 40 years. And the reason why I wanted to talk to Bob Keegan isn't uh uh just because you know, he's kind of a huge inspiration for me but also because I mean um I wanted to have his voice in the mix at the very beginning of this.
