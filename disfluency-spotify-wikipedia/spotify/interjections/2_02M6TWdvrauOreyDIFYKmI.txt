Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly weekly podcast uh I mean and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as so far um um and want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made a I mean you know mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the like well meme she put out and about be kind and I notice when I listen um like back to it that I said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a you know well big difference, but You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it I mean okay right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
