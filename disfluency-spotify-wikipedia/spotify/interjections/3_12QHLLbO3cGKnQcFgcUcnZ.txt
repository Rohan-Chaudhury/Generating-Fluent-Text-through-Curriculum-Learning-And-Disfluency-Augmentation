Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If you um well you know follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know that I um okay well post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of God. And that well well like is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking at real life well you know I mean scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using and speaking very specific I mean okay um scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart behind this is that as we um so um go through tests and trials which we can't obviously avoid but we will our mindset um um well that we would go through it will be different. I am so convinced and I you know I mean well have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
