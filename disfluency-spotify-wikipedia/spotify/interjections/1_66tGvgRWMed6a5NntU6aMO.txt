I believe unfortunately Christian the co-founder of this podcast is not able to join okay this week because he is on spring break. He's living it up in like Spain. What up Christian are you doing? But this week we have three very special guests like from Lehigh University. Number one, Matt Fisher my roommate what up, what up, dude like and Nicole and Martina the first female guest on the not so serious podcast, they're all very nervous.
