Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to like so leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on Monday so you know morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest I mean like some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to talk about you know like today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I know I said you know well this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot freak out about you know you know one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most like you know of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're / so okay like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view like so of a player but we did learn some things some players had well okay much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
