This is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's begin in well okay okay well um well you know the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen. It's uh well like I mean so well I mean called a mind all those who promise to pray for Hope is the theological virtue I mean I mean so like uh I mean so by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness uh um I mean um so um uh placing all our trust in Christ promises and relying not on our own strength, but you know you know so okay you know okay like on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit, So with hope we strive for like uh like uh uh okay you know Holiness we strive to become a saint as something which is possible but not yet um um I mean I mean um uh I mean guaranteed. And there are three conditions needed for the virtue of Hope first and active so you know well like like um like pursuit of God Holiness in heaven second, the realization that the attainment of Holiness in heaven is possible.
