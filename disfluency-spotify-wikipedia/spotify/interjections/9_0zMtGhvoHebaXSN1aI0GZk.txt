It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within well so okay uh uh um well um um a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed okay okay um you know you know um like okay okay by every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy like um um so um uh uh um okay if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact you know uh um uh well okay okay like okay on osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood you know you know um okay okay you know uh um uh flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood like okay well well um uh so well well glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the you know you know well okay okay you know like you know okay hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert um uh uh okay I mean you know um so so the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble and uh like okay uh well like okay you know so can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a so okay you know um so like I mean um well normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
