But guess what happened in those 10 years Cam Newton start I mean so listening to me and middle school and high school. Then he went to Auburn and like um told the coach to come get me. Then he went to the pros and so you know told the coach. I got to speak after all these kids in the hood well so who didn't have fathers. I became their father on Instagram.
