Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope you you know uh like I mean okay guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode starts. So um well uh I mean. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this podcast so um well well so is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought you know uh you know so um you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know so well you know okay okay catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded uh I mean well uh I mean the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the you know you know okay like so theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the uh well um so okay things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing like so like well uh up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. Uh I mean uh like I mean. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. Like you know like okay okay. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So I mean so like um uh basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically um um you know okay well having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
