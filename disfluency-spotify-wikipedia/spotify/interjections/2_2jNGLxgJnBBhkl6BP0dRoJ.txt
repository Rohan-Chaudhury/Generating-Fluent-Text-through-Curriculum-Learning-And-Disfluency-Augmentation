Hello everyone today. I'd like to share a simple podcast about effective okay well execution of strategy. So their focus is all about execution of strategy. Okay, many people come uh well up with great ideas. Great strategies great initiatives and every year they spent countless hours like so countless efforts of prepare. During creating recreating the till business plan or even set of okay uh strategic plans and sometimes they also hire very expensive Consultants to do so, but the problem I mean okay is sometimes most of the effort goes to waste why because they don't really put extra effort to make sure that they do have a systematic approach to follow up follow through.
