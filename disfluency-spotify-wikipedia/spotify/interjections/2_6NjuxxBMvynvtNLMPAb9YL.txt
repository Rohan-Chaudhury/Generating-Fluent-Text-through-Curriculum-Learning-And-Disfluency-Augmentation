Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release you know well for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget um like the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened okay well to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm like okay in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm you know I mean training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times uh um as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all so like the work out. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics well you know or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't um I mean know what that's going to be or when it will be but it just um well happens after you listen to it for a while and then when you actually well well then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come well you know together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that you know you know your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
