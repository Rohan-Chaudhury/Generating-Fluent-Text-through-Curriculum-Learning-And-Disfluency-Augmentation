Hey guys, welcome to the ladder talk. This is John. It's been a while so since we had episode with just me and Gerard So today we're going to have a you know discussion about the ethics of flipping. Now the way we're defining flipping for well the conversation today is just the selling of any shaving related item that's significantly marked uh up from the original price. We hope you enjoy the conversation and now onto the I mean episode. Hot cake flipping okay, if you can sell a Wolfman for $2,000 all the power to you. I don't know how to respond because.
