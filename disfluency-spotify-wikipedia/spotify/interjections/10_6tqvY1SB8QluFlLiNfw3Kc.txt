Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the okay okay so I mean okay uh you know you know like I mean fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place uh I mean you know um uh okay I mean you know um okay of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first um well like you know so um okay you know uh um place due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker you know uh okay so you know uh so like okay I mean because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if technically um um um I mean so um I mean okay I mean uh they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at the points uh I mean well you know so um uh I mean uh you know it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the you know okay so uh I mean I mean uh like like uh situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So uh well well uh um uh I mean like you know well the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of okay uh well you know I mean like you know like like um a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
