The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay well okay uh I mean uh emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading shockingly racist well well okay like um DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully but both fans of uh uh like I mean uh the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation okay I mean so um you know fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake and eat um um like well okay it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying how I mean well you know so uh the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the show taking okay so you know I mean you know no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners well uh you know well like are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The show is specifically I mean I mean so like I mean designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You can't guarantee an engagement okay well uh so uh or a happily ever after but every single season there will be multiple villains. Another uh uh okay I mean you know user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
