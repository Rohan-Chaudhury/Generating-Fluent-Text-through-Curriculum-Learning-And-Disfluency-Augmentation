Hello and welcome to be on the borderline. This is the podcast dedicated to I mean uh exploring in a realistic and hopeful way what it's like to live with borderline like okay personality disorder and other mental health problems. My name is Celine and I am your okay so host for this podcast. I want to issue a Proviso at the beginning of the Podcast well I mean which is that this is absolutely not a substitute for professional mental health and like like medical intervention. So, please seek out those sources of support if you need them. And okay um I also want to mention that I will be discussing topics such as self-harm and suicidal ideation.
