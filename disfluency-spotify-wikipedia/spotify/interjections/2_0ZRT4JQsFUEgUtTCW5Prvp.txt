What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford in you know you know London, Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is Thursday, like um March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little pregame combo so so for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs loss in San uh um Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row prior The I mean you know Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to sort okay so of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that well so we're key games against teams that were at least on par with them Florida um so a few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the um so Atlantic division and Vancouver who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western well so Conference. They come up against the team and they play three teams on this uh I mean west coast swing that are out of it that are basically, you know, playing out okay I mean the string and they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
