together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how I mean okay well so Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he uh okay like you know gets up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God okay okay well well to be with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to like like like okay be with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter um okay I mean well comes to him and he says to him we've been looking for you um um like um and Jesus says while I needed to be with the father but also need um you know um you know to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. You know I mean so like. It is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being um like well so with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
