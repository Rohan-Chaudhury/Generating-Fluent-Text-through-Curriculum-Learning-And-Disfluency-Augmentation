The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that um uh uh so okay I mean um I mean well were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me um well so okay um I mean okay like you know how we do it how we get it out there how we record it. Um uh okay well like well um like um. And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would okay I mean you know okay uh I mean uh I mean like have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier so so um well okay well I mean okay you know and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by um um well uh you know I mean okay I mean um far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. So um so I mean like I mean okay well uh. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment so I mean okay like uh I mean like um like or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on you know well so you know well uh like like you know your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the creation well uh I mean you know uh okay so like uh tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if I mean uh well uh I mean I mean I mean you know so we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
