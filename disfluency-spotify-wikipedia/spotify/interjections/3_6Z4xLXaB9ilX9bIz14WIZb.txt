Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing uh um like it in a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The I mean so well men of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks um you know uh of the Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day of so um so traveling the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in um well uh their midst. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp well um you know lured by bison meat that had been hung up to dry. If it decided um so um it wanted to snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware I mean well well of the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
