You are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. Um well. I'm going to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's so uh see here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard so well to believe that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of that I mean uh kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. She's since okay so moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a while, uh like but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent the last I mean I mean several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I met her like so and she has spent all these years doing that. So she's going to share some um like of her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have um you know to apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I need to do before so you know I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
