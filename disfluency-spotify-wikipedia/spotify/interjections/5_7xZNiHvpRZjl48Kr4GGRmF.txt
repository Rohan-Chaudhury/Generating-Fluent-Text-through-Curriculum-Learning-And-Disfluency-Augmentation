Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I so like I mean you know um have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we so like so um like talk about like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica you know uh so well you know Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have I mean uh so I mean you know to say anything in case you haven't read but we well uh okay okay like totally recommend it Shea tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer like well you know so um after reading Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under uh you know uh so like a rock right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow um uh okay so you know him just to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I uh so uh like okay went down when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. You know I mean like uh well. I went to his Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
