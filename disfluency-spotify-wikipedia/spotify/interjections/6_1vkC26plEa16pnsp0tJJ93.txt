Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to okay um uh um so um leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this like okay uh uh okay um on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest okay like okay well you know um some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're so you know uh so so like going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. Okay well uh I mean so okay. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate okay okay like well so you know you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly so you know well uh um so talented athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but you know so I mean um well uh they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your uh um well well uh well view of a player but we did learn some things some players had okay you know okay uh well I mean much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
