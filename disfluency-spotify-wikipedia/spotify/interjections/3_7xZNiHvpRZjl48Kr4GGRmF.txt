Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I like well um have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk about okay okay okay like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the okay so uh Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have so um I mean to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea you know I mean like tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after okay um okay reading Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a like I mean like rock right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him you know so um just to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went so well okay down when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his well like I mean Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
