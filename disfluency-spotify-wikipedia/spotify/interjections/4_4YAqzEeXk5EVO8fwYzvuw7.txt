Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with your um um like well host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for tuning in in today's uh well well I mean episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why when and how uh you know well I mean of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to me, let me at so well well I mean least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about 5 years you know like I mean you know now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a nursing home from well so you know I mean there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting working at New York um you know I mean I mean Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice World, which is I mean you know uh um really where I wanted to be I was able to sit with people okay okay uh well for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and uh well um you know we were able to see each other for a bit more than five or ten you know I mean okay okay minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple well um okay like minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've um so okay well been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
