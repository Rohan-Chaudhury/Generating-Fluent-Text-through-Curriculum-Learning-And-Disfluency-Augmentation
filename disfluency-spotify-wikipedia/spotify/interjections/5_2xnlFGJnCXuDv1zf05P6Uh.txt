What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the you know well well so I mean gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and uh you know so okay okay plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really so uh uh okay I mean excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on um uh like you know you know this shout out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this okay like you know I mean you know episode. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that um okay you know I mean I mean came out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get okay I mean uh I mean um these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already uh um um like I mean cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these like so um you know you know new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on I mean well um well okay the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And like I mean okay um you know I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of you know well I mean um so this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features like like I mean okay um and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love um um okay like so and the track package is one example, but what I think is an like I mean like so well even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
