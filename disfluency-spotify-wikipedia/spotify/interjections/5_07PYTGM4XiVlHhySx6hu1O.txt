Hey everybody and holler Mullins. I so well you know um well am here. This is our season 2 midseason recap episode. We're going to go back so uh okay like I mean to the beginning and pick up some of our favorite bits. I thought this was well you know um I mean um a good stopping point after episode 9 it kind of I felt like there was uh I mean I mean so uh some closure and it certainly feels like the last half of the Season could have been its own.
