Yes. Hi. I am calling this number because I saw it on a bathroom wall. Um. See if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is going to hell okay and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have Adam Breeze of Raven like I with us but before we hop into that, I just wanted to um go over I sold myself short on the last episode about my romantic capabilities. Uh. I think I came up on the last. Episode saying that I don't remember what I uh got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards out, but I personally think okay I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got him a heart-shaped cheesecake like covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got him Star Wars socks uh that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
