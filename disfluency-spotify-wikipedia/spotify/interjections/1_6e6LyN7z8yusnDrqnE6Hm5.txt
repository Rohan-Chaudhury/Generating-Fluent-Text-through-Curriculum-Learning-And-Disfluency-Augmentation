Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 13 of the more, you know podcast. This well is no l am speaking. And today. I'm going to talk about giving up well Perfection or this idea of perfection for progress. And for peace. I think I mean I think that it's it's where we find peace when we accept that. We are imperfect like you know Just it's The Human Condition. I want you to know that every single person you know on planet Earth is not getting it. All right, they may look like they're getting uh it right because there's maybe one facet of their life that they're really focused on uh and really paying a lot of attention to but I'm gonna guarantee like seriously, uh I'm gonna guarantee that there's other parts of their lives that are sacrificing because of it, right I look at life now is.
