Hey guys, what's up? And welcome back to the art of cooking babka I mean last week. I went to Munich and it was a great weekend. I spend the well weekend there to do a keynote talk also was a part of a you know panel and yeah had a good time in general so good to be back right um now and let's start off with a brand new podcast. This time I've invited Matt angleman I mean and he says it's not the first time that he's in this podcast. It's actually the well second I guess he is the I think he's the vice president of Atlantic Records. But yeah, I'm not running 100% sure, but I think he is.
