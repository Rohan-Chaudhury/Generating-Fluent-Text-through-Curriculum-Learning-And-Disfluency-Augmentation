You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and I mean uh you know so uh so everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to I mean like so you know well um work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an I mean like so um um you know hour a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might you know okay like like so well be directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our well okay well I mean you know well work. On the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's I mean I mean like uh so uh color but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's like I mean like you know you know well a glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about um okay well uh well uh color from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
