Hello and welcome back into the hard foul. I'm your host Pearson Fowler with like uh me as always from Gamecock central.com the bad luck charm in South Carolina Gamecocks this entire like okay weekend Colin Taylor Colin. I hate that you have to wear that albatross around um like your neck, but you had a busy weekend. He did a lot of travel. It's much well you know appreciated Gamecock fans everywhere appreciate your vigilance your dedication to traveling and I sound like I'm being um like sarcastic because it's not a clock. In the morning, but I'm being serious because so like Friday you were in Colombia. You covered the baseball game and then Saturday morning you know so you woke up and drove to Tuscaloosa. Watch the basketball game. And then you said like okay you stayed overnight in Hoover or Birmingham somewhere thereabouts and then drove I mean like to Clemson, South Carolina first thing Sunday morning to cover the baseball game then okay you know came back to Colombia. And the now you are back here in downtown Columbia at nine o'clock on Monday morning again admirable seriously everybody appreciates.
