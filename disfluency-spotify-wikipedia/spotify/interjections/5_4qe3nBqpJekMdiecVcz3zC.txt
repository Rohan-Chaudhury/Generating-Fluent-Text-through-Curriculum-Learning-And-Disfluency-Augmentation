Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic um I mean so okay uh of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind of interesting email I mean so um I mean you know here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and telling me you know like um like like how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation where I okay well uh you know uh guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting a divorce with I mean okay like so you know his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she was having well you know so well um an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing is he's I mean um I mean like I mean completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the interesting thing is well I mean um you know so he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife without any kind of attachments well you know you know you know okay or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
