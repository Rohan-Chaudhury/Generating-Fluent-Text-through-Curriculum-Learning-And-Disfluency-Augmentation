I always have a cebit my house. I'm pouring and now you know I always try to put together something as I mentioned the other day. I'd only well time I ever write anything down is Is there something going to shop so a super work for husbands or also for Purim believe it or not? Because they always write so a five or six or seven page Arturo whatever couple whatever did I like the so liver because important you drink, you know know, you know, you can't remember what well you're saying.
