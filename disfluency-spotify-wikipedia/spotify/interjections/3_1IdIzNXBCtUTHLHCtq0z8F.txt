Hey and welcome back. Hello, everybody. Hello? Hello? Hi Ryan. Hi Curtis. How are you? like I mean I mean I'm good. How are you? I'm so good. So so good. It's been it's been a uh uh um pretty eventful like week, I guess since we last recorded. Yeah, and we recorded so well like this coming episode. This guests really really early. We did we did. This is you know well so actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this little Snippets recorded after like I mean so your episode. Halftime, so we actually did have our guests on a little so um well bit earlier this week. Yeah, when he was here because of the way that you know okay okay you know, this Gus could make it around but you know, we're recording the uh uh you know intro after we record the actual episode. Typically. We like to record the intro this this you know well well snippet part without the guest even being around. Yeah. So it just the way it works. I mean uh well. So usually we recorded before the guest shows up this last step the set so well I mean this guess we didn't have time to yeah. But anyways, how was how was your week bit how how things been for you?.
