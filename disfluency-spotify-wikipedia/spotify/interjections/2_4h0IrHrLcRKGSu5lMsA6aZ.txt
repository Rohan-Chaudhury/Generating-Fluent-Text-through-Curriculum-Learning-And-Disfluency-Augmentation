extraordinary women the podcast presenting extraordinary stories by ordinary women from Munich So I'm procedure um okay right? I am South African and I've been living in Munich for almost uh you know seven and a half years and I'm currently an energy therapist but most of my focus um okay goes into a trauma Survivor community that I started just over a year ago. You know like. It was really interesting because I grew up under the time of Apartheid. And so well well I grew up thinking that how I lived was normal. I remember hearing Nelson Mandela's name for the first time when I was 9 years old.
