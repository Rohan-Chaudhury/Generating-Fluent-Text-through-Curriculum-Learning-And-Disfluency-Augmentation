Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I am too but I'm like like like trying to pretend I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this podcast episode so okay I mean set up because my microphone I feel like it's only really good for one uh I mean you know person and that I feel like our audio is always a little off and you guys like like you know have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it we're probably going to have um okay so to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome to yeah, we said it okay uh uh with me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time tuning in. This well like okay is a mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice questions that you emailed like I mean uh to me and Miss thing at gmail.com. And I would say it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
