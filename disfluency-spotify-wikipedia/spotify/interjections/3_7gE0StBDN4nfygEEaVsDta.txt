Hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised a you know so I mean bear and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. We are going to uh um um take you on a journey blank to the Future and before you and ask where okay so like we are going. You don't need green arrows and that's a good thing because okay so I mean you're not going to get them here at least not in this episode kind like well uh of a topsy-turvy week that saw several Blast from the Past tear up the usual um you know you know FPL narratives and cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s film references and of I mean well you know course I'm talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace which Drew assisted one. Okay you know you know. I believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he could be considered a um okay like precursor to America's Alonso. And of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before we get into this any.
