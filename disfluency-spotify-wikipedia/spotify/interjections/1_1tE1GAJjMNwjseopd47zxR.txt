Hello and welcome to be on the borderline. This is the podcast dedicated you know to exploring in a realistic and hopeful way what it's like to live with borderline personality you know disorder and other mental health problems. My name is Celine and I am your host for this okay podcast. I want to issue a Proviso at the beginning of the Podcast which is well that this is absolutely not a substitute for professional mental health and medical intervention. So, okay please seek out those sources of support if you need them. And I also want to mention that I will be discussing topics such as self-harm and suicidal ideation.
