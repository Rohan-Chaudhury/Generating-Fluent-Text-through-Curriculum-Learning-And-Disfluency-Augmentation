Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm your like um I mean host Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock central.com Kyle and Taylor here so uh um to talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite impressive 12-point home victory over the well you know so Mississippi State Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and you know um I mean they did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they you know so uh got up big early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that lead going uh okay so into halftime and then by the second half things kind of evened out in South like you know you know Carolina, they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 and most of okay well so the time they were up by like six or something like that but it I mean so well felt comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but a I mean okay uh lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and as much as you know I mean so we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
