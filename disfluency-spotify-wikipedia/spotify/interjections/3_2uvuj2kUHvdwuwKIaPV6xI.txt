July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year old came uh well well home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez over dinner. He glanced you know like okay out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over San Jose the largest city in uh okay well Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it seemed after dinner. He you know so so went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just like most nights but right away so okay like something felt different. It was all wrong. The drugs burned hot through his veins like okay I mean unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to hallucinate and eventually passed out into uh you know um a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
