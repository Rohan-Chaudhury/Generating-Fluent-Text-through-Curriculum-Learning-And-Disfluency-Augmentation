We're not in the new I mean studio yet because we had a little bit of a hangout if you so watch the Vlog that we posted at by the time you listen to this a few weeks like ago we found Mice in our basement. So we had to put our like project on hold for a few while we get rid of that. But in the like meantime now, we're sitting in our living room.
