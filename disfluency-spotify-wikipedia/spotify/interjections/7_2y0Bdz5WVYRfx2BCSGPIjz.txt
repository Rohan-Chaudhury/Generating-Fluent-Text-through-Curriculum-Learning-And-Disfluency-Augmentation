together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus after okay like um you know you know okay you know healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets like I mean um you know so I mean I mean up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to so um so you know you know uh like be with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with I mean you know well well um so so the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him uh you know okay I mean okay um well and he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I okay um well um well so okay needed to be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely like okay okay I mean so you know I mean interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude of Jesus in picking well okay um well so you know uh the day. He begins it by being with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
