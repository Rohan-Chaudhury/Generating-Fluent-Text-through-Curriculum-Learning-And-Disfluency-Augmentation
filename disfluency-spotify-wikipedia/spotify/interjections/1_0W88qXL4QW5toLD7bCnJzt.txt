Hey dedicated listener to The Machinist therapy hotline, as you can imagine when we are recording our uh podcast. We have hours of audio that we have to sift through more often than uh not the level of conversation is at such a high intellectual point that we're uh not sure if it really can get into the podcast. We thought we might share like one of them with you now, but remember if you want to be involved, don't so forget. You send us a DM. Send us your questions and we'll go from there. I mean. We hope you enjoyed today's episode. Thanks. I did I did the whole sort uh of winning the Florida when the Clear Water went down. I did like did Miami like and then sort of come back round again and went into they had one well of those what's it called the like the Everglades stole fan boat thingies, whatever. Yeah, and.
