And also the way that the I mean you know well like I mean I mean World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with so so okay um um okay may do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea of well okay you know um um okay ableism and how the world is set up for people who okay well well I mean I mean uh are able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very I mean you know well okay you know you know specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting so um okay like okay I mean conversation. I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review And subscribe. Bye.
