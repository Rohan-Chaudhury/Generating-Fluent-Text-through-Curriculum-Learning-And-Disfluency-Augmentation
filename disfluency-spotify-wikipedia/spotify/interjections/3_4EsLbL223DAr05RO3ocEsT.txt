His first child was about to be born as he uh like you know rushed past the Windows. He heard the crack of thunder and a deluge of rain so like I mean spattering against the glass. He stopped in his tracks the weather reminding him of a prophecy. Okay so well. He'd heard years before if you do. Do this evil thing you shall have an I mean like so evil son your nation shall become prey to Terrors and tears rivers of blood will so like like flow. The heads of the mighty will fall your cities will be devoured by Flames. He shook well you know like his head. He couldn't think about those words now his sin had already been committed now, so okay um he must be beside his wife in greet his child in the midst of the Wind and Rain.
