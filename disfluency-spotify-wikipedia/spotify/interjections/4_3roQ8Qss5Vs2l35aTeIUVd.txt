Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things okay well well like well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me you know uh um so that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of okay okay I mean you know us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a well uh well um couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance like like well okay on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's okay I mean well um it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to well you know okay I mean but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but okay like I mean you know when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
