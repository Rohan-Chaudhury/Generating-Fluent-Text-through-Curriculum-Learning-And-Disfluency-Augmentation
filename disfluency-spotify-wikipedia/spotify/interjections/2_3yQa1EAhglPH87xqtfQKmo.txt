Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic um you know of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This is something uh like that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is like like you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel like well okay things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel like well well you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're going okay well to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's well um going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just I mean like a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your okay well life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business well okay you want to build or that career you want to have is just like okay unrealistic for you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
