Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the well uh so you know so topic of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in you know I mean like well well life. This is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the so I mean uh you know so reality is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going well I mean like so okay to feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not so okay so like I mean always going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to um well um so like be really great and you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And I mean okay um okay uh other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and okay okay like uh you know you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear um like well well like and your life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that you know okay I mean uh like business you want to build or that career you want to have is just you know you know so okay so unrealistic for you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
