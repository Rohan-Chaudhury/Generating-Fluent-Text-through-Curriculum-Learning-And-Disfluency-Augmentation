Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week late. Like like you know okay um um uh um. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to okay okay I mean well I mean I mean like uh New Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a um I mean uh um I mean uh um um lot of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after but okay okay well uh well okay well uh I had so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get uh um like like well um I mean okay my pap. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people that I like like so um like I mean I mean um see in a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying like like well I mean you know so well okay in New Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here so you know okay so well um I mean I mean and nephews and it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in well I mean like you know uh so I mean like my house and no one's here right now, which is kind of rare. So I'm um I mean uh well so uh you know uh trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
