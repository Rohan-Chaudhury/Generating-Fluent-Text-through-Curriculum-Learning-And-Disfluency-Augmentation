Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai time major like I mean Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross rental yields in um okay Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking about Parnell given that which well well is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably not likely an investor suburb or uh you know a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a couple of weeks ago. I okay okay got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks in New Zealand and um okay they said can you comment on an article that we're writing for our uh like website where they were showing by the latest core logic data that the the median well well gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom you know you know apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
