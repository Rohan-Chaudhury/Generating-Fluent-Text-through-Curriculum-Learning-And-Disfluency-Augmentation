So today's reading is from Matthew so you know so like well well like so chapter 5 verse 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You so I mean I mean you know you know you know okay uh have learned how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your um I mean um you know well well so like enemy.
