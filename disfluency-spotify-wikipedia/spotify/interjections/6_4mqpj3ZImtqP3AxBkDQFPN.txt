Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a like uh uh well well like regular Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some shit you know I mean so well you know okay on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of which is um like you know um well okay the fact that I have literally not had a job for the past. Really you know okay I mean well okay so long time and like my adult life probably aside from like a gig you know well well like I mean uh here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my bank well like so I mean so like account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for a I mean well uh I mean um so few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
