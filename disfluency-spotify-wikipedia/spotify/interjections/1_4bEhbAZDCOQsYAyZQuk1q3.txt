Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard well towards Ascension. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I am well joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about okay the dream speakers in another episode of tomes of magic. But before we like do, I thought it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry well how you doing. I am doing fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to like talk about the woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A okay half hours just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where well they take it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two well hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that like Australian summer time and North American summer time do not occur at the same time. So. So I'm like, let's figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm well like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I um can wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
