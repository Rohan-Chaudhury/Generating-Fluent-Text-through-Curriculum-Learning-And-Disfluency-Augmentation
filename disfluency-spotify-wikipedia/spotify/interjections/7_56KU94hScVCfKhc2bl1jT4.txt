Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really like you know you know you know you know you know like appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible like so okay well okay um like in this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is um so like I mean uh uh okay something we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to uh okay uh uh so I mean um talk about it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite I mean uh you know uh so okay I mean unlike everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to I mean so uh uh um well you know 9, which is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his um you know I mean I mean well uh so brother John and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There I mean I mean uh um um uh you know in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
