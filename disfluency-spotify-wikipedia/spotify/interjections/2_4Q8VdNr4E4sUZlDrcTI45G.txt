Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. So okay. I guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday okay uh that that I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed um so it out a little bit the day up. But for the most part very okay um few things surprise me. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples well uh must. Have felt here towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John um so starting in verse 19 following it says this and the evening of that first okay you know day of the week when the disciples were together with the doors locked um well for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace you know okay be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
