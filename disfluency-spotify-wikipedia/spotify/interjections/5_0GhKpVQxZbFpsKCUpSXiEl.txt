This is your everyday positivity here on Vale. Hello. I'm Kate Crocker. I hope you're well okay so like I mean I mean today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough? I had a moment this week okay you know you know you know well with my coach about accountability and I was really surprised. It's always really surprising when okay okay uh uh um you think I've got that bit sorted and I'm always really good at that and okay you know so like so then someone asks you a question and you go always like that. I think I'm good I mean like um um so at that or the time actually good at that so I have been challenged okay uh um I mean so this week and And it's hard. It's hard pushing yourself through those challenges. It feels like I mean okay like you know uncomfortable you get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and you your instinct says I mean you know like well um right. I need to move away from this. I don't want to go there t um you know you know okay like harv Eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets easy when you do the so you know okay you know um hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard stuff. So something is really so okay I mean well I mean challenging you at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
