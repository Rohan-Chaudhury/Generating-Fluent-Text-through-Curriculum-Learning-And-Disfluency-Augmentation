Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or try uh okay like so I mean to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going on in I mean you know I mean you know so the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast okay well well so I mean is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that well okay you know you know like being real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's well um you know okay I mean quite the opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to well um I mean okay so grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder well I mean um um uh that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when our backs okay so like you know uh are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
