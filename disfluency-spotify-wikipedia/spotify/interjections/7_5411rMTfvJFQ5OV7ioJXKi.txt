Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on the John well so so well so okay I mean Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty seven cases well uh like okay uh well like worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the United States. We have well well I mean uh you know well you know now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 cases confirmed with six deaths well so you know well okay okay like all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we haven't had any deaths I mean okay I mean okay well so okay in California. And so there might be something specific look going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
