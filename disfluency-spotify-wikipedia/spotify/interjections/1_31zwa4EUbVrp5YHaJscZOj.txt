And you know anyway, obviously you can imagine the feedback was was was mixed and one individual um this Rob he owns a gym. I believe it's called CrossFit rise again. I apologize Rob like if I'm fucking that up. You know, he shot me a DM and you uh just like bro. I don't I don't agree. I think this argument is pointless. I you know don't get it. You should strive to do both like and he just didn't you know agree with it which was but he reached out to me and show me okay a DM and I do what I typically do when I hit him with an well audio message and explain my position and you know next thing, you know, we're back uh and forth with a few audio messages and the guy, you know, we're we went from adversarial to you know, I probably go get a beer the.
