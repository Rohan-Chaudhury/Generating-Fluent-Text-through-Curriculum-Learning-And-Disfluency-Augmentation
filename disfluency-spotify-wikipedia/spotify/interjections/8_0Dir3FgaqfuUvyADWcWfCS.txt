Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So I mean well so um I mean um like you know for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old um well well I mean I mean well okay well school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one of my um you know um um so you know so um mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she saw in um like I mean you know well like so so the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was about okay well I mean I mean you know so you know you know nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. But I okay like um like okay okay I mean you know turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
