Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking to you you know uh you know I mean um well I mean about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology and health well um you know well like I mean well because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money well you know uh uh I mean well like you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life like uh so so um um you know your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so okay um so uh like well uh many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is you know so um well um well uh our time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So uh um I mean um okay um um here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked well like um well well you know like about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I am but it's a little um okay um okay you know um um frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their families. I promise I am well I mean like you know so uh uh genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
