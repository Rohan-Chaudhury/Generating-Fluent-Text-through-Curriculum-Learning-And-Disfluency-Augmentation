Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing it uh I mean well like in a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The men of Lewis okay I mean you know well and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks of the Missouri I mean so like okay River. It was a welcome respite after a long day of traveling the sleeping men well you know I mean okay were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in their midst. Under the so like you know okay cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured by bison meat that had been okay well I mean um hung up to dry. If it decided it wanted to snack on some humans. You know so so okay. There would be no stopping it unaware of the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
