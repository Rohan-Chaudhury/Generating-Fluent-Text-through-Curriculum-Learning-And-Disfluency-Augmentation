July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year well like like uh I mean old came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez over well like I mean you know so dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over San uh so well well um Jose the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it okay okay well so like seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just like so well I mean okay you know most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The drugs burned well well like um um hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to hallucinate and you know you know well okay uh eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
