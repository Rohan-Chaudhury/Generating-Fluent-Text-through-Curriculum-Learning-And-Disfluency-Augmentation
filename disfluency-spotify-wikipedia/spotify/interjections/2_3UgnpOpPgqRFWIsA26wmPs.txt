Hey guys, it's Jeff Hammer your Law of Attraction coach with the dominating Edge today. Uh you know. We'll speak about jumping on board. So stick around welcome back. Back everyone in like I mean 2008. I had the amazing opportunity to take a train up the California coast from um you know Los Angeles to San Jose. Now I've been on a train before. But this was so okay special. It was a Peace Train. The train itself was actually made up of privately owned railroad.
