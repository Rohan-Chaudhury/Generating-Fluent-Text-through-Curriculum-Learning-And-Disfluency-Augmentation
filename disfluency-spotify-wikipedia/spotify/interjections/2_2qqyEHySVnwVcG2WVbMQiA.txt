He has smelt a long story short may not going to be in touch for a so you know while and I made not for sample cups of coffee on the lisburn road and so like we thought that the ideas and the conversation we were having may help you know uh a few older. So this is all very much part in those thoughts into I mean I mean action. And if we can help at least one other person as a byproduct um like of our conversations recording and Publishing it then we think this is a very like you know valuable form to do. So, so first of all, we're just going to basically introduce well well ourselves so you can get to know us that more about who you actually listened so uh to and then down the line move very much want to delve into some of okay uh those deeper questions that may help others. So just by where personal introduction my name is Asha Monaghan. I'm from a gallon which is about 10 minutes from the organ.
