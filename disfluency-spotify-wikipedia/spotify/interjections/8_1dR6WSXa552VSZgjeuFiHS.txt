Uh like like okay uh so you know I mean. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how uh okay um um well you know um um much money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your um I mean like you know you know okay well so personal life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I uh well I mean well okay like you know uh get so many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some vip. I mean well like well like like okay okay.

I have been in you know okay uh uh uh um um like a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal okay um you know um like I mean you know well about it than I am but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married I mean uh like well well you know well um and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
