Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were uh I mean uh you know I mean um doing it in a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The men I mean you know you know I mean okay um of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the um like like um you know well banks of the Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day okay you know I mean okay like so of traveling the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was um you know okay well so so in their midst. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp uh you know you know okay so okay lured by bison meat that had been hung up to dry. If it decided it so okay you know I mean okay okay wanted to snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware of the I mean well I mean uh okay I mean looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
