You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're like okay like just here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking uh well um apart. So it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask well I mean um that question, you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I okay you know well don't think it was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying well I mean okay each other. Meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can I mean so well be totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah um well um blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
