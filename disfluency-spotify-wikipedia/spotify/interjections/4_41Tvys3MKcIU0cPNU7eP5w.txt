Yo, yo, yo, what's up everyone? I guess I'll kick off this podcast addressing so uh okay well probably the biggest talk in sports right now. Tom Brady greatest of all I mean I mean like so time Now if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell um uh I mean like you that he's staying put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You know uh I mean so. You staying put it just doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody okay I mean I mean like that has been in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all uh you know you know I mean with one team just doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense like um well well to me. So it doesn't make sense to me for this man the go out um uh like you know and play for another team at 43 years old after spending his so so you know like entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just doesn't make sense for.
