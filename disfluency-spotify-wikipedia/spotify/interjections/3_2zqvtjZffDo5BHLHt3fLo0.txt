Hope in Jesus. Hope that is exactly what Paul is talking about here in 2nd I mean okay okay Corinthians chapter 5. We're going to start this section in verses 1 through 4 so like uh today 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 beginning in verse 1 for we know that if like so well the tent that is our Earthly home is destroyed. We have a building from uh like uh God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this um uh you know tent we groan longing to put on our Heavenly dwelling if indeed by putting it on okay like I mean we may not be found naked for while we are still in this tent okay I mean well we groan being burdened not that we would be unclothed but that we would be further.
