Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If like um you follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know you know I mean that I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of god. Okay you know. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking at real life you know you know scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using and speaking very specific you know like scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart behind this is that as okay so we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously avoid but we will our uh well mindset that we would go through it will be different. I am so convinced and you know so I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
