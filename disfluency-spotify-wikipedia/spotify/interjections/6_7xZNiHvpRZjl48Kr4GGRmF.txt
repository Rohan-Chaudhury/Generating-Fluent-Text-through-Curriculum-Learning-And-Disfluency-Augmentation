Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and like uh uh um like I mean Shay. I have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk about so you know like you know so um like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica uh um okay uh uh like Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have well um I mean like so well to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea like okay um I mean okay you know tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after so well you know I mean like I mean reading Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a um so like um um well rock right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just um okay so okay so I mean to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when well well you know okay okay okay I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his like so so okay like like Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
