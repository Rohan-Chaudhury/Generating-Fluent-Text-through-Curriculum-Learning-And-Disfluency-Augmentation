Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had okay I mean uh girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he so so you know do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you I mean so like do? Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else okay um okay had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when so so so doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be um uh so in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need so um okay to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
