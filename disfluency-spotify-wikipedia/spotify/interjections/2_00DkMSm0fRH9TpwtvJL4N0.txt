A lot of things are up on this episode of Siesta like you know Key up and down up and down literally honestly, okay. So who so many like like things happened on this episode that we need to unravel, but this episode opened I mean so up with ish and Madison, which was interesting. It was interesting seeing is back in like so town. He's back for a little bit unfortunately has to go out so you know to Canada for another few months. I'm about to see him in the episode.
