Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing uh so well well uh it in a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The men of okay okay okay I mean um Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks like you know okay uh uh of the Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day of so I mean you know like I mean traveling the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in uh okay I mean um uh their midst. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured by bison so I mean like like you know meat that had been hung up to dry. If it decided it wanted to so you know um you know I mean snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware of the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
