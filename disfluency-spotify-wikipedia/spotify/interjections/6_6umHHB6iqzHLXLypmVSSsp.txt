Hello friends, thank you for listening in today the theme of this first episode in so um so you know I mean uh a series is one that I consider really foundational as you know, my goal okay uh um uh like well with pondering purple is to help missionaries kids and the people who love them to better understand okay um um um like well the complexities that drive us the gifts and the challenges the joys and the um uh uh you know so okay frustrations of growing up in a multicultural Ministry focused and complicated environment. Ain't there um I mean I mean I mean I mean uh was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that came from growing up uh uh I mean like um so between worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and the hard then I went uh so I mean um um well to a school for missionaries kids in Germany when I was in ninth grade, so uh like well so like and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite been able to so so so I mean so okay put a finger on we're not just in me my friends at Black Forest Academy like I mean okay like uh you know exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
