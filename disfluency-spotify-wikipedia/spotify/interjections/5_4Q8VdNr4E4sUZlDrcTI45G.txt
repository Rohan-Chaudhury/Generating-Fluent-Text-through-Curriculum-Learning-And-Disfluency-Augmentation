Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. Uh you know um um uh. I guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that I had like so you know um I mean a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little bit uh um so I mean um the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. It um well um okay uh is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here towards um you know like I mean I mean the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse like like so uh um 19 following it says this and the evening of that first day of the week you know uh well well okay when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the jews. Like okay you know you know okay. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you after he uh um uh you know uh said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
