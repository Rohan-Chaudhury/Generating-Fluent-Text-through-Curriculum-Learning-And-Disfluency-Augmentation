Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get like um like like um a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I um um um um well forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I like um you know uh well just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like um I mean so well well when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry um you know you know so uh when I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many so you know so like so times as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was like um well uh you know broken all the work out. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will I mean okay like okay like pop up or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and I mean like I mean uh um you don't know what that's going to be or when it will be so uh uh I mean you know but it just happens after you listen to it for a while and then when you uh like so well so actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two I mean uh so um um things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So those little like uh uh like um moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
