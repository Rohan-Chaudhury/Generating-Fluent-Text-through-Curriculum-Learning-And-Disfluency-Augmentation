So I go into the NFL after so uh you know like so like the demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was uh okay okay you know like like the one with Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl well okay like okay like so and the AFC Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This I mean like uh uh uh okay was the game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you play so well you know like I mean you know that demo. That was your first experience.
