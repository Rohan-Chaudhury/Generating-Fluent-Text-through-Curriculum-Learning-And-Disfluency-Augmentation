Are you going to love this one? I put out so much content that um I mean um um if you listen to my stuff for free every single day if you listen to okay well okay well one of my pieces of content, there's over 10 years worth of content. There's over so um uh um tick like you can listen to me once a day for 10 straight years and not have um uh I mean like to pay nothing. But guess what happened in those 10 years Cam Newton start so um okay um listening to me and middle school and high school. Then he went to Auburn okay okay I mean so and told the coach to come get me. Then he went to the pros and like okay uh well told the coach. I got to speak after all these kids in the hood who so you know um I mean didn't have fathers. I became their father on Instagram. So when they went um so like so to the NBA they Daddy with him when I went to the NFL. They uh okay I mean well took their daddy with them when they became preachers and start a church when they uh you know well I mean became CEOs or execs at companies when they look for a trainer it wasn't that I was.
