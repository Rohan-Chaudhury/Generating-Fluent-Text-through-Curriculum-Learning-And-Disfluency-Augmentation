Is arranged marriage a scary well proposition last year three of my friends had terrible experiences involving arranged marriage in the um first experience. The two parties are engaged and right before the wedding the girl told um him that she loves somebody else in the second experience as a wedding date approached uh the girl ran away with her boyfriend in the third experience the two well parties got married, but within a month my friend found out that she well was still in touch with her ex-boyfriend and probably had an affair and asked he filed for you know divorce right away.
