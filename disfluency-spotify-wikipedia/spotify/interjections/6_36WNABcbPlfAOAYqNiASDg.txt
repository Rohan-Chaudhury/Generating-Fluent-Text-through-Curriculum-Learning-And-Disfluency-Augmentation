If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes like um so you know I mean well in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened it. I was you know well um so like so reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you saying all well well well well I mean okay is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that habit um like uh I mean well okay of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And like well well uh um um so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels and well you know I mean so well well we want to remind you that that there is a stream of well-being uh well well okay um um which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever you know so well you know um um reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that well okay you know well okay you know stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so so okay you know um you know uh you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
