I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this podcast um okay well is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I like well okay thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, I mean uh like you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as so like like I recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what you know uh well the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the so I mean like things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up uh so well and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So you know uh so with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. Uh um so. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically well I mean like growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having okay well like them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
