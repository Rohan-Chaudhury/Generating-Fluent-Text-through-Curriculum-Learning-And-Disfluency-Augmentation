Has um well so Amy what could stuff have you heard in the news this week? Okay, so well like okay I know in a moment you're going to be talking about a really huge well you know like piece of news that was covered in the media last week. So I thought it might uh you know like be nice for me to start with maybe a slightly smaller you story that okay so well people haven't necessarily heard about and I was scrolling through Twitter last week and stumbled so well like across an article about hair salons and basically a number of salons across the UK have been boycotting gossip magazines.
