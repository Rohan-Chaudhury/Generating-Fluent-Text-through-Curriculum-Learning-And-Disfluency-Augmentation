All right, I hate doing this but we got to pay the bills and I don't know how you're listening to this podcast right now. Thank you for listening by the way, but if you haven't heard about anchor it's the easiest way to make a podcast. I know everybody's been locked up during this quarantine and a few people have reached out to me and asked for advice on how to get their podcast started or distribute it out there and anchors the best way to do it. It's free. There's creation tools that allow you to record and edit the podcast, right? Your phone or your computer? You can have your fans leave messages. Thank you to those of you that have been doing that by the way, keep them come and keep harassing us and anchor will distribute the podcast for you and can be heard on Spotify Apple podcasts and a bunch more this so many channels that are podcast is on some of them. I never even heard of so it does the work for you and you can make money from your podcast with no minimum listenership. You can you can you can you can you can just hit the ground running.
