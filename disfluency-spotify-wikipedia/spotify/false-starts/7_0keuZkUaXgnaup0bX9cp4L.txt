Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but act but act but act but act but act but act but act but it's basically the idea of ableism and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting conversation. I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
