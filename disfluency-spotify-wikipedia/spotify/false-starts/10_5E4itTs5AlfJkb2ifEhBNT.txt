Oh, hey guys. Hello surprise back. We got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got we got a little we just missed you guys. So we just got a letter so for you here, we wanted to talk about a few things that we've been stumbling upon over the last few days since the finale and couple things we want to talk about before the reunions show just in case that It gets wild and we don't want to you know, take up too much time in the podcast after that. So we're yeah, the internet is swirling with post interviews and insights into the show. And I think now that they can be open and doing you know, you definitely see certain couples out there on the interview circuit and making appearances. And so we just want to talk about what we found out since the show and how we feel about it going into reunions and second seasons and spin-off and really we're looking for.
