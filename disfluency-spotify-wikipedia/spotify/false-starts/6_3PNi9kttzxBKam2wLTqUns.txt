We can we can we can we can we can we can we can Glimpse the world Anew through each other's unique perspectives. And there and there and there and there and there and there and there is no possibility of certainty you can have a yes they did to do to live and to act but certainty the things most of us believe 40 years ago. However certain we were about them. We don't we're not certain about exactly the same things today. The world changed language is not capable of absolute Clarity. It's.
