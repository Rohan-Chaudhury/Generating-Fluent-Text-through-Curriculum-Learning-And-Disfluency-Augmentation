Welcome to the lair a podcast. This podcast is in conjunction with the layer Aid conference which is happening for the third year on Saturday, June 6th, 2020 in Providence, Rhode Island. The layer a conference is the first one to solely focus on social engineering and open source intelligence or osint gathering social engineers and osint investigators always seemed to have a great story. Re and you can hear many of those stories through their presentations at the conference, but not every story can fill a whole presentation and not all storytellers can get to the conference which brings us here. This podcast will only be stories told by the investigators themselves. No interviews. No slides no slides no slides no slides no slides no slides no slides no slides no slides just stories some might be a short as five minutes some may even go for 45 minutes.
