Acts 3 one day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer at 3:00 in the afternoon. Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the Temple Gate called Beautiful where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts when he saw Peter and John about to enter he asked them for money Peter looks That him as did John then Peter said look at us. So the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the man gave them his attention expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said silver or gold I do not have.
