All right. Chloe Sutton. Welcome to the podcast. How you doing? I'm great. How are you doing? Brett very well. Appreciate you coming on you've got an amazing story and I love for you to share it with a lot of people. Yeah, thank you. I'm so excited that you're doing this. I think I think I think I think I think it's somewhat long overdue and you know, I love listening so far and I can't wait to continue to follow along in the future. Yeah. I mean I've told you many times we have such great conversations and we talk in depth about how you got to where you are and what drives you and what motivates you and all those sorts of things. I think I think I think I think I think is so important to share and I've had great conversations with a lot of really good coaches. And athletes in the past few weeks just working on this and I think we can all.
