It's like we blinked all of a sudden the 2020 season is upon us. We're just we're just days away from opening weekend. How is your off season first and foremost Scott. Do you do you feel kind of refreshed ready to go? Just blacked out and then woke up and it was like we're about to kick off and I was like, oh good good thing I woke up in time. Then sort of like a Sleepy Hollow thing God. I set my alarm. Yeah, and I think the remnant or like the remedy was like a rowdies preseason game or something. I showed up and I was like, whoa, we're like it's like what's happening? This is this is happening there soon as they beat Montreal. I was just like yeah, we're back in the swing of things.
