Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other and other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
