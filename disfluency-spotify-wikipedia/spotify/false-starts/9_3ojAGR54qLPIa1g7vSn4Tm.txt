My name is Adam. I am your host. Thank you to everybody who listened to the last episode and welcome to anybody who is a new listener here. So on this episode, I'm going to be doing something a little bit different I am going so I'm trying to put together this like algorithm. And so I just wanted to kind of film and put together. Kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of making it I guess is the best way to put it I mean so I've been looking into like I've talked about in the past I talked about in the last episode that I really am a big fan of the Bowman Chrome rookie cards. So not the Bowman Prospect cards the ones with the RC logo. So I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I was putting together some statistics with the PSA Pop reports and then the pricing of those specific cards, so Here's basically what I got, so like I was looking at like players basically I use trout as a baseline, but I think something that's when I originally made this.
