This is the second ever podcast I've ever made. So I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I hope this isn't too horrible and still trying to find my feet. So I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I hope you are bear with the bad editing in places.

Anyway, let's get on with the show in this show. I cover recent news and questions that I've been asked by the community. I then spend the rest of the show focus on a conversation about maniples the basic building blocks of the game. I was intending to spend some time discussing how to use them as narrative devices, but following some feedback and realizing have a lot of Basic Ground to cover I'll be focusing on the man of courses primarily from gaming perspective. This is a longer episode than I initially planned and you'll probably notice a slight change in Styles throughout the main section of the shug. This week work was a lot busier than I was expecting and much for my normal recording time was taken by.
