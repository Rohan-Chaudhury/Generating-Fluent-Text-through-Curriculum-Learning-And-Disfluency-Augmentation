Hello and welcome to Fitness unfiltered episode 64. So this so this so this so this so this is our first in a couple of weeks due to some scary scheduling issues. For those of you that did notice they be a large percentage of you that didn't notice but we did promise that it would be worth the wait. So before we get into it is only right to acknowledge that I'm also joined by Emma and Mike as always so M. How are you I'm fine. Excellent and Mike, how are you? I am also fine. Okay, so statements of I'm fine pretty much make sure the world goes around I think so. We are actually joined by another and we are honored and excited to be joined by Doctor David. Robert Grimes who is a physicist cancer researcher award-winning science writer and author of a best-seller, which I'm not just saying this because he's they're here. I did actually say it to Mike off air as well. It is one of my favorite reads of 2019. And the irrational type which we all are irrational apes are times I think so.
