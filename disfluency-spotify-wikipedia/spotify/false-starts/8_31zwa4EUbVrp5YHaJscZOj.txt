And anyway, obviously you can imagine the feedback was was was mixed and one individual this Rob he owns a gym. I believe it's called CrossFit rise again. I apologize Rob if I'm fucking that up. You know, he shot me a DM and you just like bro. I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't agree. I think this argument is pointless. I don't get it. You should you should you should you should you should you should you should you should you should strive to do both like and he just didn't agree with it which was but he reached out to me and show me a DM and I do what I typically do when I hit him with an audio message and explain my position and you know next thing, you know, we're back and forth with a few audio messages and the guy, you know, we're we went from adversarial to you know, I probably go get a beer the.
