But just but just but just it's weird being sick and trying to recoup its weird. But I'm headed. I'm headed the right way. I'm headed the right direction. I think so, but yeah, thanks for asking. I'm glad you're on. On the mend we did a couple patreon exclusive shows over the weekend or Friday night and you were sounding a little rough. But at but at but at least you know, you stuck it out for our wonderful patrons absolutely over there, which I know they appreciate so for this episode or actually before I get started with the episode make sure you're following us on our Instagram at Marvel Studios news. I'm doing a lot of things over there doing daily MCU trivia, some of you are doing very very well. Good job, good job, good job, but also we gave I put up a post on their a week or so ago offering an opportunity.
