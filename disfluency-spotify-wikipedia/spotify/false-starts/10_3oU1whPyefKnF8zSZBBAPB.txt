Just got to get up and tell the devil who you are. You gotta tell that devil who you are today. I woke up and I told the devil who I am in Christ. I am complete in him who is the head of all principality and power. I am alive in Christ. I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am free from the law of sin and death. I am far from oppression and the enemy cannot come near me. I am born of God and the evil one cannot touch me. I Am Without Blame before him in love. Love I love I love I love I love I love I love I love I love I love I love I am in right standing with the father. I have the mind of Christ. I have the peace of God that surpasses all understanding greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. I have received the power of the Holy Spirit. I have put up the old and put on the new I have been given and it's been given to me. I have no lack for my God shall supply all my needs. According to according to according to according to according to according to according to according to according to according to according to his riches. I have been called out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light of the Gospel.
