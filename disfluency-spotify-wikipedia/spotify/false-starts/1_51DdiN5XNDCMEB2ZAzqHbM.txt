Hello everyone. Welcome back to another episode of easy natural English with Liam. How are you? All doing today? I've had a good day. Well so far. Yeah, it's yeah, it's been a good day. I'm recording this from Hawaii. But actually I'm going to schedule this episode. So I'll record it and then I'll save it to come out later because I will be traveling back to Japan. So yeah, so yeah, if you were listening before then you'll remember that that I was in vacation in Hawaii while I still am when I'm recording this and yet going back to Japan. So this one will you'll be listening to this while I'll be probably be on an airplane or perhaps I'll be in Osaka because I'm going to spend a few days in all.
