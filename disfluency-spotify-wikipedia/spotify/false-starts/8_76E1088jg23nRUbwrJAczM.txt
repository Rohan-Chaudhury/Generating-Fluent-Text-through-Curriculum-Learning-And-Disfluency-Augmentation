Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine to determine your fate. And the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the reason why I feel that this is such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to become a man of value so that way other men or other people in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
