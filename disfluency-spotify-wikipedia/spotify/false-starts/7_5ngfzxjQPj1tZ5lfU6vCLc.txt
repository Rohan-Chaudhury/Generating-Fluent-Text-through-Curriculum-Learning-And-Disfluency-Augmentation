Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt you felt you felt you felt you felt you felt you felt you felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with this world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you crazy.
