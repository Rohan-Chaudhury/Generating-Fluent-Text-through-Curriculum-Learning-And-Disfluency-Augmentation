Happy birthday, the weed tube. You're two years old. And I love you. This is fun to speculate a podcast where we speculate about wild and crazy ideas. And now and now and now and now and now and now and now and now here's your host Aaron Richard. Hi everybody hi everybody hi everybody hi everybody hi everybody hi everybody hi everybody hi everybody Welcome to a brand new episode of fun to speculate. I'm your host Aaron Richard and sitting next to me is producer Vlad. Hi guys. I'm back. Well, yes you were sick last for the last episode. That's right. Yeah, because in the grand scheme of things we recorded it's actually been a while since we like sat here to do and episode 2 because we recorded so many episodes in like a three-day time span and we had a nice little break in between and now we have to catch up and record one like every week or schedule another week of insanity. That's okay though. I love this show. I love this show. I want this show. I hope everyone in the world listens to that's a little bit extreme, but, you know, I hope a lot of people enjoy it. I hope we keep the topics coming in good thought-provoking ways, and I just hope we always keep it entertaining for you. So, thank you.
