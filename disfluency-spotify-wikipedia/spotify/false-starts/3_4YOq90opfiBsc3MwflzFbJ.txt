Hello everyone and welcome to frog and the dragon. This is the first episode of podcasts devoted to cube in this season. We want to show you guys the basics of the format and gradually over time build you up to your own Cube. Each episode will be focusing on a different aspect of cube design and hopefully like say in a couple weeks time. You'll have your very own Cube. Ooh, I'm John by Rupert freaking.
