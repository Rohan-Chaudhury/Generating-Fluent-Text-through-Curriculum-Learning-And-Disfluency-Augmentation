It doesn't make me afraid I did not injure myself. So there is no need to worry or I don't need to worry that there's damage. And anyway, and anyway, and anyway, and anyway, and anyway, and anyway, and anyway, and anyway, and anyway, and anyway, this is just what I'm feeling and I know it'll pass at some point and movement really seems to make all the difference which I think is so cool. Hello, everybody today. We are joined by Jenna and she's one of my clients and she's actually turned into a quite a dear friend of mine during our time together. And so today we are going to be having a conversation about her journey that led up to her and I working together where she's at. Now what she likes about our time together things that you can't stand also perhaps we'll see where it goes. But the goal of today is to highlight her journey in the hopes of connecting.
