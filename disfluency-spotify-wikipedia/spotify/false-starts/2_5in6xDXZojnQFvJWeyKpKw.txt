I'm the I'm the I'm the owner and operator of dialed Health, which is strength training for cyclists. Now today. Our topic is all about why circuit workouts are optimal for cyclists. This topic was sent in by an underscore Austin in do thank you so much for this idea because he noticed that most of my Programs and pretty much all the workouts. I put out our mixed in some form of a circuit. So you want to know why that is. Is it is it is it something that really is better for cyclists. Is it just my style? What is that? So we're going to break down the science and we're also going to break down some reality because you know, all the science in the world. Sometimes can't sometimes can't sometimes can't get around real life factors. I think I think I think so, we'll talk about both and then really why I choose to do them and why I do believe that it is optimal for cyclists. As always we're going to start with a life update lots of cool stuff happening this last weekend.
