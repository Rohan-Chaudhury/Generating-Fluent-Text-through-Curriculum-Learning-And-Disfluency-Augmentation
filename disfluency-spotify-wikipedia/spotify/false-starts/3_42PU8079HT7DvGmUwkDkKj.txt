Good morning, everyone Welcome to our Friday spending time with Jesus podcast today. I wanted I wanted I wanted I wanted us to look at Romans chapter 1 the entire book of Romans is jam-packed with Theology and interesting thoughts and just like amazing Epic.

We're dealing we're dealing we're dealing we're dealing with the question of is the law of God really written on the human heart no matter where they're at. No matter no matter no matter no matter where they've grown up or what they've heard all their lives and it's an incredible chapter it lists out all the ways that we can act basically in sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that.
