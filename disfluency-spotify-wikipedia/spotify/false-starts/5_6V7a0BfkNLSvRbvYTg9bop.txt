We're going we're going we're going we're going we're going we're going to explore topics that are too important to wait until your last day on Earth as we introduce each topic. We encourage you to remember that some tomorrow will be your last so each new day could be your final chance to really live. This week we'll be covering introductions for Daniel and I where the idea for the podcast came from and some of our topics moving forward. Thanks for listening. Okay, Andrew, what would you do if you were going to die tomorrow? If I was going to die tomorrow? I would probably do something involving being shirtless for starters and hopefully something memorable at the same time. You know, I've got this idea in my head of that scene from that movie. I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't remember where the guy.
