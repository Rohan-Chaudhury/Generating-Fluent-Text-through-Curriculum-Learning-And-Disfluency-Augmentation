Greetings, this is Douglas. Gimple senior portfolio specialist at Diamond Hill Capital Management. And this is understanding Edge. It's been it's been it's been it's been a pretty crazy week and a half in the markets. We reached out last week with three podcasts covering domestic International equities as well as fixed income, but given how things ended the week. I thought it would be beneficial to get our chief investment officer for fixed income bills aux-in. To discuss what he saw over the last week and a half thoughts on the FED Palace comments from Friday and where we're headed and what we're looking to do in this type of volatile environment. Hope you enjoy this. Thank you very much and enjoy Film the last seven trading sessions stocks as measured by the S&P 500 are down close to 13 percent while high-yield as measured by the ice BofA high-yield index.
