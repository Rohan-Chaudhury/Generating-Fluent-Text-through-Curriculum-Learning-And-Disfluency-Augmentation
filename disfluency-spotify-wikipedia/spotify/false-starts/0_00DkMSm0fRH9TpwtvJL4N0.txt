I'm Maria Menounos and you're tuned in to AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of TV Todd. Now look the buzz. So excited season 3 episode 9. This episode was insane you guys I'm your host DJ. Unfortunately Ally couldn't be with us tonight, but we'll see her back next week and I'm here with my lovely co-host a b'nai Chatman. Oh my goodness. A lot of things are up on this episode of Siesta Key up and down up and down literally honestly, okay. So who so many things happened on this episode that we need to unravel, but this episode opened up with ish and Madison, which was interesting. It was interesting seeing is back in town. He's back for a little bit unfortunately has to go out to Canada for another few months. I'm about to see him in the episode. I'm glad to see that Madison got her little ish fixed.
