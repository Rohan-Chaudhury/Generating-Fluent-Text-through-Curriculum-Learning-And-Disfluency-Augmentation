Hello guys. This is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is dr. William Cairo Bowl starting the first broadcast that I'm going to be doing regularly once a week to cover the basic science of the coronavirus and to review and sort of restore some of the sanity to the conversation about this this illness in sort of the electronic discourse that goes About it to try to just seal fact from fiction. There's a lot of Buzz right now in the media. I believe that there's been a very severe, you know response already like last week in the stock market and Wall Street, and I decided to do this podcast because I realized that.
