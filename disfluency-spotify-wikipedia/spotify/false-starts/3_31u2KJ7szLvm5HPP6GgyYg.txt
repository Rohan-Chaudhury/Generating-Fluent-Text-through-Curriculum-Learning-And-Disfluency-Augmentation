My name's Emma tuba and you're listening to the network marketing manager audio experience. Welcome, welcome welcome. It is the first of the month today and which I really really loved doing a training doing a live doing a podcast on the first of the month because I think it's a whole new opportunity. Thank the Lord you are here. There are so many people that didn't see out last month and you've got to be grateful that you are here you are present you are able to make some changes this month if you weren't happy with last month and you can make a difference and I want you to see that as something Really really really serious and really something to be so grateful for because sometimes we just take things for granted. We stumble stumble along in life not making any changes hoping things were different. Sometimes I sometimes I sometimes I sometimes I speak to people and they.
