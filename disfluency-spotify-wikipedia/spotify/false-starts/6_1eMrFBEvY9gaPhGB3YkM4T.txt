Make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't it didn't it didn't it didn't it didn't it didn't it didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
