Hi, everyone, what's happened? And I'm here with Johnny. Bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has bargain has all she on top and Blake all good. So today we are recording the first episode of the podcast that we've been talking about recording for at least two or three months. He has smelt a long story short may not going to be in touch for a while and I made not for sample cups of coffee on the lisburn road and we thought that the ideas and the conversation we were having may help a few older. So this is all very much part in those thoughts into action. And if we can help at least one other person as a byproduct of our conversations recording and Publishing it then we think this is a very valuable form to do. So, so first of all, we're just going to basically introduce ourselves so you can get to know us that more about who you actually listened to and then down the line move very much want to delve into some of those deeper questions that may help others. So just so just so just so just so just so just so just so just so just so just so just by where personal introduction my name is Asha Monaghan. I'm from a gallon which is about 10 minutes from the organ.
