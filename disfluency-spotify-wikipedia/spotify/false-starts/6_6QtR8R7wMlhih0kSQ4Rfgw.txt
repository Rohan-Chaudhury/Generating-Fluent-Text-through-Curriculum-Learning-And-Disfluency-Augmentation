There are more than 95,000 cases and over 3,000 debt and the virus has spread fast outside of China with more than 70 countries now affected and we're starting to feel it here in the US just this week the World Health Organization put out an estimate of how deadly this virus is with headlines saying that it's killing Three point four percent of the people who get it worldwide. So just how worried should you be the start we call that well, why don't you introduce yourself? Sure. So my name is Cecilia Beaux. I'm.
