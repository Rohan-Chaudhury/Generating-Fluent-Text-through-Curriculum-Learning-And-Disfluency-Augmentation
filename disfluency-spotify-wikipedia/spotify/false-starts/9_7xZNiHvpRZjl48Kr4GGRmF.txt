Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk about like life. So last so last so last so last so last so last so last so last so last so last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question my question my question my question my question my question my question my question my question my question is no spoilers. We don't have to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't follow him just to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
