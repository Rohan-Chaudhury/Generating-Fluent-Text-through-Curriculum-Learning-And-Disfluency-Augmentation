Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you guys so much for tuning in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why when and how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to me, let me at least help you understand who I am. I've been I've been I've been I've been I've been I've been I've been I've been I've been I've been an RD for about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a nursing home from there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice World, which is really where I wanted to be I was able to sit with people for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were able to see each other for a bit more than five or ten minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
