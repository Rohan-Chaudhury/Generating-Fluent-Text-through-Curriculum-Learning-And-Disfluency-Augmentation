But first of all, I'd like to introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a board certified Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see I see I see I see I see I see I see I see you about 40 50 patients a day and the office I'll still go to the hospital and usually have a census. It's been 5 to 15 patients, including ICU and critical heal patients. So literally so literally so literally so literally so literally so literally so literally so literally my patients have been very worried about the core virus and to be honest who is not been worried about this. Okay? And therefore I've had multiple questions regarding, you know, what what what they can do to protect.
