Gonna log online gun line. What's going on? Y'all? It's your host Danny Lopez for the on the gun line podcast and you're listening to the midweek memo for March for 2020. I'm dropping the kind of league. Y'all check it out. I fucked up this morning. I don't have enough time to do it our at night last night and this morning. Well, I got a shift change so I don't have enough time to do it in the morning. Like I used to kind of ran out of time. So now I'm doing it on my motherfucking lunch break. How to light my cigarette up anyway, let's go ahead and get down to this business on the midweek memo today.
