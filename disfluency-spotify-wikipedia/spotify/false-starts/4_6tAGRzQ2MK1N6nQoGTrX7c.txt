Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today and today and today and today and today we're going to be going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
