Just got just got just got just got off the back of doing some live training to Bluestone College. I did four locations in one hit which is the power of the internet and amazing technological breakthrough where you can be in four places at one time. So very very exciting stuff and that's kind of inspired. Is this is this is this is this little podcast that I'm putting together for you today? But before we get into that, I want to give a shout out so over the last couple of weeks. I've been running a little bit of a giveaway. So for so for so for so for anyone that leaves a review on iTunes and sends me over a screenshot. I will enter them into a draw to win a little little gift from me.
