Hey everybody. Welcome to welcome to welcome to welcome to welcome to Mom Hood, it's Wednesday. We're so glad that you're here. I hope you guys are having a beautiful week. We are we are we are we are we are stoked because today is part 2 of the October Gonzalez interview and we have been absolutely dying to release this one. So this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and man. There are some nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear it. If this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think that all of the information in part to her story all her tips the way that she parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost more like valuable when you know where she came from part 1 is all about her life as a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her as a young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
