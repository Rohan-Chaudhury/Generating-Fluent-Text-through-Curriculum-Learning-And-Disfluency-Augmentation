Hi and welcome to the well-read man podcast where we talk about why reading and friendship matter for women and how to make space in our lives for it. I'm Marcy Stockman and author speaker and founder of well-read mom. My passion is to help women read more and read well and also to encourage us to make time for leisure friendship and literature to view our booklets or join a group near you visit while red knob.com. Hello, this is Janelle and Nicole co-directors of well-read Mom. Thank you thank you thank you so much for joining us on today's podcast. We're excited to delve into some of the frequently asked questions that are members and leaders asked so we'll get started right away. The first question that came from our members this year and some of our leaders was can you help me understand the membership terms meaning when women join? Well, where'd mom we asked them to agree to a certain way of doing things?.
