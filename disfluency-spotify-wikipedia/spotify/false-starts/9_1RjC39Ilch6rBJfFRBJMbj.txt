What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, everybody Anton craley here from e-commerce lifestyle.com and welcome back to the podcast. So a big question that I get either via email or over on our YouTube channel is from people that are just getting started with their online store and they want to know what they actually have to get done prior to launch. So kind of the technicality is right and this is outside of how to pick a niche how to get suppliers how to get traffic all that stuff. You can learn more about on my free training over at Dropship webinar.com. I'll post a link to that in the the description by the way Dropship webinar.com, but once you know all that stuff and you kind of understand how to build the business then the question is, well, what do you actually have to get done before you make that website on Shopify before you contact your first supplier before you get your first sale? So I want to cover a business checklist in this podcast go over a couple different options you have and then let you know what I do and what I recommend so with that being said, let's go ahead and get into today's episode. Okay. So the first thing we should talk about.
