Hey everybody, welcome back to the project Prima podcast. I have with me today the lovely Kathleen child's and I'm so excited to introduce you to her. She is a fantastic lifestyle coach and she knows a ton about nutrition and I wanted to bring her in today because I am getting so many questions about ways to optimize fueling to lose way to be your best self and frankly. I don't feel qualified to talk to about that but I do think that Kathleen has a wealth of knowledge. So hi so hi Kathleen, do you want to introduce yourself? Hi everyone. Sure Joy. Thanks for thanks for having me on today. I am Kathleen child. I am a mom of two boys ages 8 and 6 and my husband Tom and I live in Boston. We love living in the city. It's a fun life. I.
