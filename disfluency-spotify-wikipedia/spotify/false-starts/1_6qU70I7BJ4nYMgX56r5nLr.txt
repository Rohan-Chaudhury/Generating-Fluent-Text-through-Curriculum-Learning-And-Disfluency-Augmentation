Good morning, and welcome to the Australian Market briefing podcast for series eighty fifth of March 20 20 yesterday. We got the GDP data for the December quarter, which means it is basically the status quo before the bush fires and coronavirus hit we saw the annual economic growth head risen 22.2% up from 1.8% This means that GDP was up by 0.5% in December quarter, this was larger than the 0.4% that economists were expecting. This does this does show that the RBA is reading at the economy was at a gentle turning points towards the end of last year was correct. However, it looks like that gentle turning points has turned into an S turn due to the fires and the coronavirus this data will be used as a baseline to determine how much stimulus.
