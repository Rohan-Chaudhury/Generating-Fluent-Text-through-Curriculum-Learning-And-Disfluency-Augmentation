All right, and thank you for joining in on a session of coffee with down today. I've got the lovely trainer cheer as my special guest for the session of the copy that thank you for coming today. Let's talk let's talk let's talk about the coffee first and then then let's do a little talk about you and finance and where we are. So I've taken here. Thank you for being brave enough on a Friday and I've got you a an espresso martini with a difference. So we're in this little cafe actually not. Okay, there's a bit of a bar called Holly house in Melbourne self American flavor to it. So it's I don't think I've ever come across a martini. Espresso Martini, but with a bit of cookie in there.
