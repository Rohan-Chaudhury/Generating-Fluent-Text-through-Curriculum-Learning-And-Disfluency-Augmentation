We're going to start this section in verses 1 through 4 today 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 beginning in verse 1 for we know that if the tent that is our Earthly home is destroyed. We have a building from God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this tent we groan longing to put on our Heavenly dwelling if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked for while we are still in this tent we groan being burdened not that we would be unclothed but that we would be further.
