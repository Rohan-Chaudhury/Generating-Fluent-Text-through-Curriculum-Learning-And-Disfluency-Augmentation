So the podcast is really rolling now and enough so that we have our first sponsor. Our first sponsor ever of the blacktop bantered podcast is stencil plus. So I use stencil plus with my business. They made they made they made a handicap logo for me amongst other custom logos and different things for me as well. They have the lowest price guaranteed guaranteed. They have free shipping on all orders over $50. You can have a free company logo stencil made free and they have lots of cool Social Media stuff going on there always interacting there's thousands of stencils to choose from and they can create anything if they don't have it already. So if you have something very custom you want made they will work with you and they listen to their customers needs of what they want what they need to work with. So the other thing that is I'm super hyped about is that listeners of this podcast.
