This is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's begin in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen was called a mind all those we promise to pray for. I think the most exhilarating truth is that before the world was created God already had you and I in mind each with our own particular place in the grand plan of history that no other person can or ever will take we were designed for this role and only we can fulfill it and if we don't no one will Father favor and his spiritual conferences rights. No two no two no two no two no two no two no two no two no two of us are alike. God saw a specialty in US eternally, it was this specialty which he loved it is this specialty which decides our place and our work and his creation.
