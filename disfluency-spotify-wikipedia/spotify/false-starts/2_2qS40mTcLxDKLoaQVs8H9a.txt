Welcome back to reading the Psalms. I'm Dan I'm Dan I'm Dan and I'm going to read Psalm 16 today. This is another Psalm of David. Preserve Me O God for in the do I put my trust I have said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord. I have no good be on thee as for the saints that are in the earth. They are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight their sorrows shall be multiplied that exchange the Lord for another God their drink offerings of blood. I will I will I will not offer nor take their names upon my lips. The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup Dow maintains my lat the Lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places. Yea, I yea, I yea, I have a goodly Heritage. I Will Bless The Lord who has given me counsel. Yay. My reins instruct me in the night Seasons. I have set the lord.
