I'm just Hello weirdos and queer queens and everything in between what boom you're listening to the podcast hot queer mass. And I am your host Lucy Sykes. Thank you for tuning in again for another week of Mayhem craziness insanity fuckery. If this if this if this if this if this if this is your first time listening to the podcast shame on you start from the fucking beginning. You'll be lost. What if you don't like to listen to rules or obey them you can continue to listen to it, but you should pour yourself a drink because I like to say fuck a lot and every time I say fuck you should drink or smoke or whatever.
