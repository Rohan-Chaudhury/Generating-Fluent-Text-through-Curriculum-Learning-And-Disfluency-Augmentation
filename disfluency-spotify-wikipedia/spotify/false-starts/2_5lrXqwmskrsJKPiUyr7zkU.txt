Principal Callahan, principal Callahan, principal Callahan, I've got principal Velazquez online for put her through Cal. How are you? Not so bad value self never better, but you can make me even happier. Well, I told you we can't keep doing that. It's a conflict of interest. Oh get oh get oh get your mind out of the gutter Callahan. I have interns who do that now. Anyway, I saw reports this morning that chili Doug Davis is looking into the foreign exchange program that she is that she is but it's gonna take a pretty hefty. Package for me to send her to Barcelona if that's what you're after. You know why they call her chili dog. Don't you tell me cow ate 50 of them in one Lunch Period or freshman year right down the gullet and not 20 minutes later scored a 96 on our biology midterm. Just shy just shy just shy of an A+. Look point is the kids a stud a Phenom. I'm not about to give her up for a pack of pens in a book Let's Not Be Hasty. We think chili dog will be a great fit in the halls of our school and coming to Barcelona will be an enriching experience for both her and us now you want to hear my offer what tell me about.
