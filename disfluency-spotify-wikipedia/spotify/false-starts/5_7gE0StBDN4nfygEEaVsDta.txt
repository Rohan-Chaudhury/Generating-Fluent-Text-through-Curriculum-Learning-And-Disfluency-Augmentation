Hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised a bear and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. We are going to take you on a journey blank to the Future and before you and ask where we are going. You don't need green arrows and that's a good thing because you're not going to get them here at least not in this episode kind of a topsy-turvy week that saw several Blast from the Past tear up the usual FPL narratives and cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s film 80s film 80s film 80s film 80s film 80s film references and of course I'm talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace which Drew assisted one. I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he could be considered a precursor to America's Alonso. And of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before we get into this any.
