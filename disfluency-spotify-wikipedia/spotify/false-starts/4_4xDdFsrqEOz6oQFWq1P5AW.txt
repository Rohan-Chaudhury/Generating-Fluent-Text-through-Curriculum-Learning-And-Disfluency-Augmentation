But also quarter extremity movement violations, we're going to dive specifically today into the importance of it and where to look in a handful of different movements. So Fern first question I have for you is when were you first introduced to the concept? out of out of out of out of out of quarter extremity the book definition of it at the level 1 course, however physically introduced to it probably day one is an athlete like as a little kid. They just they just they just they just they just don't teach it that way but when you teach any type of throwing mechanics, typically the first thing you teaching most kids to do is probably jumping or throwing something right. So throwing a football or baseball as a child and and learning how to do that. That's.
