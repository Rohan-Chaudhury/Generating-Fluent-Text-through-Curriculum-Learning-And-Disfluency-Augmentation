Hello and welcome to patch and this is a podcast. That's about OverWatch. I'm always amazed with much League hosting skills, huh? I'm always I'm always amazed with your hosting skills. I mean, I wasn't really listening to you. I was tuning you out. I've already I've already listened to you enough the last two days, but welcome. We have a lot of stuff to go over today. Not really because we just watch the same teams play for the last five weeks, but we got hero pools now. Yeah. Thanks both of you on the ends. The fuck the fuck do I was listening back to the companion stream and you were like, oh, it's not that bad right on this pan. So now you're actually targeting me during the podcast when I saw you live say I did not that bad. But what I'm doing is I'm trying to dig into your own insecurities about picking Rhino. I'm so happy about it. Yeah hiring happy with my selections about you. You were the worst I couldn't think of to like, I woke up this morning. I thought about it. I was like all I play is hitscan Heroes.
