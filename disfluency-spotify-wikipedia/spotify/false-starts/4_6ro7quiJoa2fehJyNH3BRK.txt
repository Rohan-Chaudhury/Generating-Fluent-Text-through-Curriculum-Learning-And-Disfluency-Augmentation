Usually I wait to reflect on my guest and work on the introduction for Saturday mornings. There's no there's no there's no there's no there's no sleeping in my house because we have a puppy and he likes to get up really early. But today's but today's but today's but today's but today's a little bit different. I keep I keep I keep I keep I keep thinking about our guest. Mrs. Whitman's story. I know her story is going to resonate with so many of you out there. I want you to listen. This one all the way through. If you don't know. Mrs. Whitman, you're going to know her pretty well at the end of this half hour episode this half hour goes by fast. Now. I know this sounds like a Shameless plug but it isn't please share the episode people need to hear her story. They need to hear about her resiliency. They need to hear about how she weather's so many different storms that have taken place in her life. Thanks for listening. Please let me know what you think write a review.
