So I go into the NFL after the demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one with Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and the AFC Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This was this was this was the game that you could play. So yeah, so yeah, so yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you play that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty yeah, pretty yeah, pretty much why you chose to be a broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a Broncos fan because well quite frankly because I have a horse and I went and I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
