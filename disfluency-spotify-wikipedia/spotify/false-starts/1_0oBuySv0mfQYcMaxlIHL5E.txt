All right, Frank Bush welcome to the podcast. How you how you doing, my friend? Brett I'm doing great. Thank you very much for having me. Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time. It's been a little while since we've chatted. So what have you been up to since your retirement from USA swimming? But Patty and I my wife decided probably when I had a year left in Colorado Springs at my position that we would move back to Tucson. And so and so after I retired from the position at USA swimming, we came back rented a home. We're currently.
