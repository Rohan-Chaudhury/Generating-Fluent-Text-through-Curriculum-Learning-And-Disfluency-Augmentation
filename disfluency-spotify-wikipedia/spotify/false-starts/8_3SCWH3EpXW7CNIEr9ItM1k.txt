The Tuesday first race of the day of the meeting is a supreme novices hurdle grade one. We've got shishkin at five to two Astro and phalange 72 Abracadabra 601 change warehouses noise and then we've got my pick a last 25 to 1 Nick ends and seconds during the race with Jeremiah McGraw confirmed to be riding him on the day.
