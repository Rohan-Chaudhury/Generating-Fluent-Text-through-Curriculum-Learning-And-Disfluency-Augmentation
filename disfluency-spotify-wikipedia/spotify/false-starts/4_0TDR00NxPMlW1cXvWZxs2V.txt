And then we're going to do a little bit of challenging our view on luck. So I hope you guys are doing well. Hopefully it's turning to Springtime where you are just moments before coming into my garage to record this for y'all. I was out in the sun just baking in it. Just loving it. Feels so good and it's actually kind of a little bit about what I'm going to talk about today. So I'm getting out in front of myself, but it's crazy how son feels the best right after the winter time. Right? Like right when you've endured like those freezing cold days freezing cold snow ice hail winds you're out doing those runs. They're just miserable and you just can't wait to get home and get warm and then when it burst turns to.
