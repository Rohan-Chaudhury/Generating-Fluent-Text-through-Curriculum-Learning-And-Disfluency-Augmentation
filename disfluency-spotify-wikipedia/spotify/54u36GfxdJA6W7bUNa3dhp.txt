Welcome ladies welcome. So I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat texting and FaceTime. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I do a lot of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some of you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few minutes and then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk about first uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age of 25 and that and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it for real. It's pushing it. I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
