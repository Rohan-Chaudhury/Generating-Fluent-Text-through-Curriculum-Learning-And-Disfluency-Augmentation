Now Sports now Sports now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui yui yui you is the uh you know fires are so nasty. They are now tied with with with the Washington Capitals in first place of you know so the Metropolitan. Well, Well, Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to you know so so so the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it is it it it is it the tiebreaker because um uh that would make the most sense, but of of of course not listen, I don't care if technically well okay they're not in in in first. All I care about is when you look at um okay the points it it it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the I I I mean um situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. Happy happy. So the Flyers so I mean beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on on on a second half of a back-to-back back like I mean in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
