And also the way that the okay like World perhaps disables us more more more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with uh okay may do which might might might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the I mean okay okay okay idea of ableism and how the world is set up for people who who who are uh uh able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in in in a very so uh specific way.
