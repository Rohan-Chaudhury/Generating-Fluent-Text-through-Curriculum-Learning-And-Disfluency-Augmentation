As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and a a half. So. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was a a little I mean odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through through the roof. We like had just about over a hundred people in one room, which which was probably a I mean fire hazard looking back at it but us us being students not our number one problem and really you know it was just just bingo. So anybody so anybody could win and there were Current objects of pleasure. Pleasure. Well. I guess you could say I'm not too sure what is safe for for the radio. So I'm uh going to kind of curve that but also objects to to practice safe sex like our ad okay reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a like thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
