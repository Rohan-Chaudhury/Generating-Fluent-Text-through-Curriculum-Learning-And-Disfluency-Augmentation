But before but before but before we do, I thought thought thought it might be uh like nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. Doing doing. I am I am I am doing okay I mean fine. I was on the the the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the woo Kang I mean I mean now we we we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about the Wu-Tang Wu-Tang Wu-Tang I mean um because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take take take it where he I mean well takes 18 pages of material and talks about about about that for two hours wasn't quite enough but so so the key mistake I made made made was I forgot that Australian summer time and North uh I mean American summer summer summer time do not occur at the same time. So I'm like, let's I I I mean you know figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm I'm I'm like 9:00 p.m. So you know.
