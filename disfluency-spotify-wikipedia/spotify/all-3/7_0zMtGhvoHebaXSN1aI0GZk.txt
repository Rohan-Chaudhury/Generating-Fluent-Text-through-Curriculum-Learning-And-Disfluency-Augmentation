It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a I I I I I I I I mean well um I mean like uh well small range Lucas is important important important important important important important important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by well I mean like like I I I I I I I I mean like I mean every living cell. If there is not enough glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy well okay uh I mean okay you know well well well well well well well well if blood glucose levels are too high. This can this can this can this this this this this this this this can this can this can this can this can have a negative impact on uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh I mean so okay uh so okay osmosis, which is the movement of of of of of of of of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients I mean okay well well you know like like like like like like like like uh as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a a a a a a a a high so like okay so like um um concentration. Enough blood glucose if the the the the the the the the concentration of blood glucose is too high the so you know you know I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean so like okay pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle tissues detect you know you know um like um like like the presence of insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a like okay I mean well you you you you you you you you know like uh form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Later later later later later later later. Use this well uh well well I mean I mean well process continues until until until until until until until until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the if the if the the the the the the the the if the if the if the if the if the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
