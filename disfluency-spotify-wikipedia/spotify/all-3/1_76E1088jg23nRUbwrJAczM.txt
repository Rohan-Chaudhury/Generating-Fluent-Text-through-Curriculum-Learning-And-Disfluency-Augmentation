Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining okay okay to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more more like masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is is um such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to to actually um control their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that that way they're in control um of what they would like and as a man man this is important to your success. This well this well is ridiculously important to to your happiness. And not only that if you want to become I mean a a man of value so that way other men or other people in so general can lean lean on you. You're going you're going to have to learn this. So here's the the I mean deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a a person um who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not not going to you know do very well. Okay, because okay, because this video might take take me a little bit to okay explain so grab a pen grab a paper. Paper. If you if you can't take well five to ten minutes to to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
