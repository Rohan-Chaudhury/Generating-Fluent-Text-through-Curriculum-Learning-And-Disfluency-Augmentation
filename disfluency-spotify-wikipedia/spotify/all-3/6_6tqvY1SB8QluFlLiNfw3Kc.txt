Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires like like like like like like like um you know I mean um okay are so nasty. They are now tied tied tied tied tied tied tied with the Washington Capitals in first uh like uh uh you know like place place place place place place place of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean okay well uh well I mean place due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that that that that that that that head-to-head. Is it is it is it is it is it is it is it it it it it it it the tiebreaker uh like like um well well because that would make the most sense, sense, sense, sense, sense, sense, sense, but of course not listen, I don't care uh I mean okay like you you you you you you you know like if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you you you you you you you look well well okay so well like at the points it is tied. This very very very very very very very moment and just the fact that that um okay like like um I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh I mean so uh like so. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four four four four four four four to one on a second so I mean um uh I mean you know half half half half half half half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
