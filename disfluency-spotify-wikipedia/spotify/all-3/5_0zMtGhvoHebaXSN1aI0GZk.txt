It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small small small small small small well okay okay well so range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy energy energy energy energy energy needed by every living like you know um you know you know cell. If If If If If If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy um um I mean well well well well well well well if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, which well I mean so uh okay is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration gradients as blood flows through um you know like I mean I mean the the the the the the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose well well well well well well um I mean well okay if the concentration of blood glucose is too high high high high high high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin I mean well like like you know into the the the the the the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these I mean mean mean mean mean mean like so I mean so convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of of of of of of glucose that is insoluble and can I mean like well um okay be stored stored stored stored stored stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal uh so you you you you you you know uh um blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
