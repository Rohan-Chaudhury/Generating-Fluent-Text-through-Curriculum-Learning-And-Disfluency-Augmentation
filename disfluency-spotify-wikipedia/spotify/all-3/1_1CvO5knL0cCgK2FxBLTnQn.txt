Hello and welcome to vlogger History season 2 episode 2 My name is I mean mean Ann Foster. And this is a feminist women's history comedy podcast. I don't know know you know why I made there be so many words in explaining what it it is, but like I think I've explained it properly in every episode so far. Far. So in season one, we I mean were looking at women who who made made history by quote unquote misbehaving which is I mean sort of like also also not Don't quote misbehaving because several of them did murder well people this season we're we're looking at women leaders and how men complained and were freaked out about it and how it's not so different from nowadays when.
