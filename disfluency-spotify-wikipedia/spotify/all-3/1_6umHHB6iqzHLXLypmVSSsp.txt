Ain't I mean there was a time when I I wasn't aware of the differences that came well from growing up between worlds worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and like the hard hard then I went to a school for missionaries kids in Germany like when I I was in ninth grade, and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences.

That's where that's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
