It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within within within within within a small like um well well range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The The The The The energy needed by every living cell. Um um okay I mean. If there if if if if if there if there if there if there is not enough glucose an organism organism organism organism organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose so um like like levels are too high. High high high high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is the uh okay okay okay okay okay uh okay movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through through through through through the pancreas. I mean I mean so um. The body can detect if there there there there there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if you know uh like I mean the concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin uh so so uh uh uh uh uh into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert convert convert convert convert the you know you know well okay excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form form form form form of glucose that is insoluble and like okay so I mean can be be be be be stored for later. Use this use this use this use this use this process continues until until until until until the pancreas detects a normal like so I mean um blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
