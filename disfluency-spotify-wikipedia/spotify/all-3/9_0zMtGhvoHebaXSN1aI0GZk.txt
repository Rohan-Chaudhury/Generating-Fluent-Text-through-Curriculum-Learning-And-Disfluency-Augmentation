It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a like like like like like like like like like like I mean so uh so uh I mean you know so small range range range range range range range range range range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living like like like like like like like like like like so uh uh okay um I mean well uh cell. If there is not enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood okay like you know okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay well I mean like I mean glucose levels are too high. This can can can can can can can can can can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is like okay you know uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh like so uh uh uh the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration gradients as blood flows through the like you know I mean okay I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean um okay um you know pancreas. The body can detect if there is a a a a a a a a a a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if okay so I mean uh well like like well okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin I mean I mean so well um you know so uh um into the the the the the the the the the the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the um um um um um um um um um um okay I mean um um uh um well uh excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a a a a a a a a a a form of glucose that is insoluble and can well okay I mean okay um you know know know know know know know know know know well so I mean be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a a a a a a a a a a normal um so um um you know so uh so okay blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
