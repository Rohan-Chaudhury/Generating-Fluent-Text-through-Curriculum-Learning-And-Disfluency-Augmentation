Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard towards towards uh Ascension. So you so you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson Simpson and I am um joined by terrie Robinson. And today and today we we are going to talk about the dream speakers in um another episode of of tomes of magic. But before we do, I thought it might be uh uh nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I am am doing okay fine. I was I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about about the woo Kang now uh we talked for almost two and a A half hours hours just about the Wu-Tang because B so ches discussion of the Hem Caso back back where they take it where he takes well 18 pages of material and talks about about that for two hours wasn't quite enough I mean but the key mistake I made made was I forgot that Australian summer time and so North American summer time do do not occur at the same time. So I'm like, let's well figure figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm like you know 9:00 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I like can wake wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
