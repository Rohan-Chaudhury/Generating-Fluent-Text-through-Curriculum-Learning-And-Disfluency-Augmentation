We know that we need the wisdom wisdom of a mentor to so help us focus on what matters and and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding that well person. We trust and whose experienced experienced is impossible. And then if we do find them then well on the other side side of the world or is too expensive or they just don't have well the time. I've I've been I've been mentoring people now for over 30 years in a one-on-one well basis and and at the start of this year. I've been thinking a lot about uh how I I can mentor more people how I can help more people. So okay so okay okay I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be able able to join you know me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You You can ask me questions anything you like you know whatever you are in in the world for a fraction of the cost that um this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation.
