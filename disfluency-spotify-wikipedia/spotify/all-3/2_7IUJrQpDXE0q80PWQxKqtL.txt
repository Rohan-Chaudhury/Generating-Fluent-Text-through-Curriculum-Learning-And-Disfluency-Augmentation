Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about about about I mean like the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the the the wisdom of a mentor uh um to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly costly costly mistakes yet, too often like okay finding that person. We trust and and and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we okay so do find them then on on on the other side of the world or is too expensive or so so they just just just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 years you you you know like in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been um um um um thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help help help more uh well people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship mentorship mentorship group here. You'll be okay like able to join me live for monthly monthly monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask so uh me questions anything you like like like whatever you are in the world for a fraction like uh of the cost cost cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
