Welcome ladies welcome. So I so I want to talk a little bit about about Snapchat texting and well FaceTime. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I I do a lot okay of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them them some of you know you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a a few minutes and you know then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I I want to talk about first um uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over over the age of 25 and so that and that's pushing it 25 is just just pushing it for real. It's pushing it. Okay. I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
