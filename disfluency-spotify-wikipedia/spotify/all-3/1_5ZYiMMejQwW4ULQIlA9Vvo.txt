Welcome to the hottest take my name is Chris Ryan. I am joined by like Jason Jason concepci√≥n Juliet Littman and David Shoemaker and David you have before. I I mean mean know that we fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country needs needs like is a king. Oh my oh my God now listen. Listen, I'm not saying saying we need a uh monarch with absolute power. I'm not saying we need to go go to some like Royal like Dutch like diagnostic system. But look at England right right now how much better would okay our political discourse be if we would just elect elect the king for every like a I mean decade every 10 years. Donald Donald Trump gets to be king. But we have like a like a boring-ass boring-ass technocrat. Who's They're as prime minister is actually making the decision, I mean right? right So he's have a guy who's a guy or a gal whose job I I mean is to go to NASCAR races and give speeches and set off.
