They are now tied tied tied tied tied tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the you know I mean you you you you you you know um okay Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first first first first first first place well like well you know well due to the tiebreak, which is crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker um you know um like like like like like like well because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I um um um um um um um okay um um don't care if technically they're not in first. All I care care care care care care about is when you so like I mean okay I mean look look look look look look at the points it is tied. This very this very this very this very this this this this this this very this very moment and just the fact that um well so I mean um um um um um um that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me me me me me me so you know so I mean well well happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes four to one on a second uh like like okay well half of a a a a a a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
