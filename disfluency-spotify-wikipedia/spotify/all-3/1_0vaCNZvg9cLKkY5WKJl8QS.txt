Hey everybody. Welcome to Mom Hood, it's Wednesday. We're so we're so glad glad that you're here. You know. I hope you guys are having a beautiful week. Week. We are we are stoked because today um is part 2 of the October Gonzalez Gonzalez interview and we have been absolutely uh dying to release this one. So this this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and I mean man. There are there there are some nuggets up in here. I can't I can't wait for you guys you you know to hear it. If this is the first one that you're tapping tapping on I so do recommend. Going back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely absolutely imperative. But I I mean do think that all of the information in part part to her story all her uh tips the way that she parents it's all all like so much more interesting and almost I mean more like valuable when you you know where she came from part 1 is like all about her life as as a young girl how she was parented her family uh story Dynamic her as a young young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
