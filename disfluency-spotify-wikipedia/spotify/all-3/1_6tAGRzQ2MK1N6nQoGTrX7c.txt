Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be I I mean going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation well well is to be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened so out arms arms at your sides. You can also do this in a seated position. If If well you are sitting you want to make sure that your back uh is flat flat up against your chair or a wall if you have your you know legs legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet um Flat on the ground ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once so once you find either um you're you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find find your okay navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
