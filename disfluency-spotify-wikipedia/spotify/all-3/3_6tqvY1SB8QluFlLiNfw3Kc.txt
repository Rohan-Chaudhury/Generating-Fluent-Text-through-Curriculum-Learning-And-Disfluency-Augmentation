Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are uh uh uh uh okay you know so nasty. They are they are they are they are now now now now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place well I mean I mean of of of of the Metropolitan. Well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically I understand the Caps Caps Caps Caps are still in first place okay uh uh due to the tiebreak, which is is is is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the well you know uh tiebreaker because that that that that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't okay well okay care if if if if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look I I I I mean you know you know at the points it is tied. This very moment and and and and just the fact that that is well I mean okay the situation we are are are are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the like so so so so so Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back back back back okay well you know in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
