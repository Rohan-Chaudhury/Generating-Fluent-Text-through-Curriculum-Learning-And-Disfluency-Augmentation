What a what a what a what a paper change welcome to another episode episode episode episode today. We're going to talk like well uh about the gross margin impact of a successful successful successful successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and so I mean um plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a a a a you know well so financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the the the the third uh well uh row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. Episode episode episode. We were just recording um so uh and we're talking about this new track package package package package that came out for the model 3. Okay I mean uh. It's like it's it's it's it's like it's like it's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically basically basically basically get these really cool looking uh like you know new tire. Hours for hours for hours hours hours hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then so so so so so okay you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and and and and these brake um well I mean pads which are geared to make it it it it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. I mean you know know know know you know. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like like like like wow, there's so okay I mean so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of of of of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all like okay okay of these fancy new features features features features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like so okay so Tesla nerds nerds nerds nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what I so I I I I mean well think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
