Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I I was very okay traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism organism right in uh front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading reading the rules again. Well. And again, it was so dark in here that I I had to use the small lamp um on the table next to me. They really really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, well I also realized I had broken broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. So. It didn't do much damage. This is is going to be a great shift. The uh first thing I tried was to to walk out but I could see movement in well my peripheral vision. They They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
