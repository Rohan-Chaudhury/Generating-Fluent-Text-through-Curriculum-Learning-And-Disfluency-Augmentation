And in this episode, I'll just just be introducing waking youth. How um did I come up with this idea? And what what waking youth is all about so um over the summer I was listening to a a lot of podcasts and I was well thinking that I really wanted to work and and focus on my creativity and when I like started the semester I am Third-year communication student student in Spain. I was also looking for well an initiative and I was feeling very stressed stressed and very anxious and I realized that you know a lot of my friends were were also feeling like this because uh we're obviously we're very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and.
