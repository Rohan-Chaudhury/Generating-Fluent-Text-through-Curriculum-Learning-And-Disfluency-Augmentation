It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a so so so so so so so so like I mean well well small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living uh uh okay uh well I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean cell. If there if there if there if there if there if there if there there there there there there there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if like I mean so so so so so so so you know well like blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative negative negative negative negative negative negative impact on osmosis, which well well uh so uh you know is the movement of of of of of of of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through so okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay um you know well the pancreas. The body the body the body the body the the the the the the the body the body the body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood blood blood blood blood blood blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood so I mean uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay I mean I mean glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high high high high high high high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin uh well um well I mean um into the bloodstream the the the the the the the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert um uh um um um um um um um um uh okay the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of of of of of of of glucose that is like so you know I mean uh I mean insoluble and and and and and and and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects so so uh uh uh uh uh uh uh well like uh a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
