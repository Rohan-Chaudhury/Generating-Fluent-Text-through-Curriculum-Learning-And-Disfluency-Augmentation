And yes, and and and and yes, and yes, and yes, I well um you know have a coach coaches coaches coaches coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I I mean mean mean mean um like had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how how how how hard you know uh um it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself myself myself myself to fall into this I mean uh well pattern of just beating myself up in in in in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know uh um well better than than than than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop uh you know know know know you know and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to to to to me okay okay um so very profound and the shift that it has created since since since since then has been so powerful that um you know I mean he just knew that that that that I had to share it with you. So that's so that's so that's so that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
