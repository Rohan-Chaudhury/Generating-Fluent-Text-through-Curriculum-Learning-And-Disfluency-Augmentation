This is your everyday positivity here on Vale. Hello. I'm Kate Crocker. I hope you're you're so well today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough? I had a moment moment this like week with my coach about accountability and I was really surprised. It's always always really surprising um when you think I've got that bit sorted and I'm always always really good at that uh and then someone asks you a question and you you go always like that. I uh think I'm good at that or the the time actually good at that well so I have been challenged this week and and And it's hard. It's hard pushing yourself through well those challenges. It feels uncomfortable you you get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and you I mean your instinct says says right. I need to move away from this. I don't want to um um go there t harv Eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets easy when when um you do the hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard stuff. So So uh something is really challenging you at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
