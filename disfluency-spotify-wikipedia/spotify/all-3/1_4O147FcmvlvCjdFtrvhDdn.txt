Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if if you um want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported reported that okay Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew crew Link in the like description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was like certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley um was announced as next season's leading woman. Woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was so filming something weeks after production wrapped, wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has um to be the winner winner of this season, right? Is there is there any other reason Maddie Maddie would you know have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as but as as of right now I see no other explanation well unless y'all have other other theories. Let me let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. Below. So. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new new so to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So well well check that out on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after after show live so tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
