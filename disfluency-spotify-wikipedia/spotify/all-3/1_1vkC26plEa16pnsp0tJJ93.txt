Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to to like leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this this on you know Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a a couple days to um digest some of the performances from the skill position players players and that's what we're like going to talk about today the offense of risers and and fallers from the combine. Okay. And I know I said this on last week's show show but I have okay to reiterate you cannot freak out about one data point from the the combine. These are you know Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most of of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, you know but they're / like like fractions of a second. So that so that shouldn't make you wildly um swinging your your view of a player but we did learn some things some players had much much I mean better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
