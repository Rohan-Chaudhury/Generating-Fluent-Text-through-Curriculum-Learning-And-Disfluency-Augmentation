What's up, everybody Anton craley here from e-commerce lifestyle.com and welcome back to the the podcast. So uh a big question that I get either via email or over over on our YouTube channel I mean is from people that are just getting started started with their online store and they want like to know what they actually actually have to get done prior to launch. So kind of the okay technicality is right right and this is outside of how to pick a niche how to well get suppliers suppliers how to get traffic all that stuff. You can learn more about on uh my my free training over at Dropship webinar.com. I'll post a link to that uh in in the the description by the way Dropship webinar.com, but once you know all that that so stuff and you kind of understand how to build the business then the question question you know is, well, what do you actually have to get done before you you make I mean that website on Shopify before you contact your first supplier before you you get your first so sale? So I want to cover a business checklist in in this podcast go over uh a couple different options you have and then let you you know what I do like and what I recommend so with that being said, let's let's go ahead and get into today's episode. Okay. So the first thing we should talk about.
