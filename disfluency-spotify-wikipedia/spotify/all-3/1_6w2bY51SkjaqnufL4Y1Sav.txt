See if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're you're listening to Brandy is going to okay hell and today is going to be extremely extremely exciting. I have Adam Breeze of Raven you know I with us but but before we hop into that, I just wanted to go uh over I sold myself short on on the last episode about my romantic capabilities. Okay. I think I think I came up on on the last. Episode saying episode saying that I don't remember what I so got. Got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards out, but you know know I personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got um him a a heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got I I mean him Star Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
