Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be your uh uh host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and and to renew the you know title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And And the memory verse is taken I mean from John 7 verse 37. And it says on on the last and greatest day of well the festival Jesus stood and said in in a loud voice let anyone who is thirsty I mean come to me and drink drink when we view the invitation to come to Jesus Through you know the lens lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
