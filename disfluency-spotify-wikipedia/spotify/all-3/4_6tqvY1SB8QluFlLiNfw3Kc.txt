Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the uh you know know know know know okay uh fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals Capitals Capitals Capitals Capitals in first place of like um you know I mean the metropolitan. Metropolitan Metropolitan Metropolitan Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place you know um um um um um I mean um due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it it it it it the tiebreaker because okay uh I mean so that would make the most sense, but but but but but of course not listen, I don't care if I mean uh uh um technically technically technically technically technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at the well well well well well uh uh okay points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that that that that that is uh okay so so the situation we are discussing right now is is is is is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers okay so so well beat the Carolina Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a like okay you know uh back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
