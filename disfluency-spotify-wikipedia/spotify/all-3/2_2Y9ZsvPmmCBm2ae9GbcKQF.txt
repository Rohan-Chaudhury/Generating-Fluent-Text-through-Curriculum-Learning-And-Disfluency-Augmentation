Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you you you guys. Hope you guys well um are all having a lovely lovely week so far far far now before this episode starts. I I mean well just want to give a quick quick quick announcement. So the so the so the title of this podcast okay you know is is is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought thought thought I thought I thought uh I mean you know, what like catching up with friends. Friends friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know uh okay catch up with me sounds sounds sounds like a good title. But then but then but then as I recorded uh like the the the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme theme theme of well okay this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the the the things that I mean so we covered from the past few episode is about mental mental mental health growing up and things we well uh deal with as a teenager or as as as a young adult. So with that said the so you know new title of the podcast podcast podcast will be basically growing up. I finally figure out well so what the theme of of of this podcast should be. So basically growing up is going to I mean uh be be be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them share what they they they think um so is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
