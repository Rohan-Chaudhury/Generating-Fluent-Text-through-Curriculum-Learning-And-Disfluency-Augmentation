And so so so so so so so um okay uh yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking talking talking talking talking talking to my coach um like you know I mean um because I had been feeling really really really really really really stuck in some feelings about parenting and okay so like uh well how hard it can can can can can can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself um um um um um um um um um um to fall into this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. Unhelpful unhelpful unhelpful unhelpful unhelpful. Like I mean well like okay. A way, which I know better than to do do do do do do but I just kind of I mean I mean okay I mean so got caught caught caught caught caught caught in a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my um I mean um um um um um um I mean so coach said something to me so very profound and the shift that that that that that that it has I mean like like I mean like created since then has been so so so so so so powerful that he just knew that I I mean so so okay I mean had had had had had had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
