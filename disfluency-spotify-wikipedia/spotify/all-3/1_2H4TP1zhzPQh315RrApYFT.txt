It's hard to to like believe that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All um um of that kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when we we um get together. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't haven't chatted so in a while, but it was really great to record this episode. Episode. She has spent um the last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty pretty into it whenever like I met her and she has spent all these years doing that. That. So you so you know she's going to share some of her knowledge knowledge of herbs and we had a really uh good discussion. I have to apologize that I I have not figured out yet, which I need uh to do before I do do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
