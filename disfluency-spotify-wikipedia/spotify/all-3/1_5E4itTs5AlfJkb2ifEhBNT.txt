Oh, hey guys. Hello surprise back. We got a little we just missed um um you guys. So we just got a letter so for you here, we wanted to to I mean talk about a few things that we've been stumbling upon over the last last few days uh since the finale and couple things we want to talk about about before the reunions show just you know in case that It gets wild and we we don't want to you know, take up so too much time in the podcast after after that. So we're yeah, the internet is okay swirling with post interviews and insights into the the show. And I think now that I mean they can be open and and doing you know, you definitely see certain couples out there on you know the the interview circuit and making appearances. And so we just want to talk about what like we we found out since the show and how we feel about it going into reunions and second seasons and spin-off and really we're looking for.
