Okay story time. I was driving to visit visit a friend while well listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light Light by shamash, which I so highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew blew out one of the like speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from from getting it you know replaced. So instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff stuff that is still enjoyable um when it's only coming out of one of of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm okay not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
