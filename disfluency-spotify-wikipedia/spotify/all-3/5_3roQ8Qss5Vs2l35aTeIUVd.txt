You're supposed to sit well you know well um I mean on on on on on on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on like like like like like like I mean well okay so it and dance on it.

So when you you you you you you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but I mean I I I I I I mean so so you know they just can't help themselves, but do a little little little little little little Skipper.
