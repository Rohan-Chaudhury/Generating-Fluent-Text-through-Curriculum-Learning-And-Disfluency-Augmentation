Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast podcast like with your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much much for well tuning in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what what like why when and how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen listen to me, let okay me at least help you understand who I am. I've I've been an well RD for about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. Places. I started off uh at a nursing home from there. I was able able to go into a clinic Uncle like setting working at New York Presbyterian Hospital Hospital finally I made it to the Private so Practice World, which is really where I I wanted to be I was able to sit with like people for longer longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and um we were were able to see each other for a bit more than five or ten minutes like like and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes minutes well in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because because they've um been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
