Gossips to her boyfriend about Caroline Calloway, and for some some um reason he listens. I'm Shay I'm Ryan. And and and and today we are are shifting a little um bit. We are we are going to obviously still be talking talking about Caroline, but we're going to you know shift a little bit into some Taylor Lorenz snark and for that we have a special guest today.
