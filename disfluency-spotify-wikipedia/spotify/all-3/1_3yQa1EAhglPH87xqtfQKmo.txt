Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter newsletter and the topic of like today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my my purpose in life. This is so something that I think pretty much every man struggles struggles with because the reality is I mean you're not going to stay positive positive all the time. You're not always going I mean to feel like things are going to to work out in your favor. You're not you're not um always going to feel like you're you're doing the right thing someday is going to um be really great and you're going to to be full of passion and feel inspired. Okay. And other days it's going to feel hopeless and and like things aren't working out and I mean you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if if you got people chirping in I mean your ear and your life telling you what a a stupid idea that you've embarked okay on or that business you want to build build or that career you want to have you know is just unrealistic for you. So I've I've got an email here from a guy I mean who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
