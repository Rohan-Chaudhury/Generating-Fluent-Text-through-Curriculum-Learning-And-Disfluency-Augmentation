That's right. I'm back with another episode of med school radio and we're looking at at at at at at at at at at at so um you know you know uh um um uh okay I mean some more educational objectives. Objectives objectives objectives objectives objectives objectives objectives objectives objectives objectives. Let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get get get get get get get get get get get let's get let's get let's get right to it starting with fragile X syndrome. What What What What What What What What What What What I mean I mean okay like so um well so okay you know is this this this this this this this this this this this caused by this is caused by an increased number of cgg trinucleotide um so um um um um um um um um um um um I mean well um like you know you know well repeats on the fragile x. X X X X X X X X X X. Mental retardation Gene and that is fmr1 on the long um okay okay you you you you you you you you you you you know like like I mean you know um well arm of the X chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome and this leads to hyper methylation and inactivation of fmr1. So well so well so so so so so so so so so so so well so well so well so well so well so well so well so well so well well well well well well well well well well well well okay okay um okay uh you know so um remember these cgg trinucleotide repeats fragile X mental retardation fmr1 gene on the long arm. Leading to hypermethylation and.
