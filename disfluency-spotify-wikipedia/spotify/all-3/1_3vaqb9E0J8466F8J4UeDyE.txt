I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew crew Link okay in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated speculated that uh Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead dead like because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get get this like straight.
