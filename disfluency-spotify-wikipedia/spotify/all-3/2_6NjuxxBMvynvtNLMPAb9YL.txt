Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a a a release like like for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Les Les Mills. I forget well well the choreography and I don't even think about it being being being a workout. I just listened to you know so the songs and I have them on on on the whole time. Like when I'm in the you know okay shower when I'm making making making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I just try like okay okay okay and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not even well okay okay okay thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just filled music music music and what okay you know happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand stand stand out all these musical landmarks will I mean you know come up and you you you don't know what that's going to be or when it will be but so okay okay okay it just happens after you listen to it for a while and then when you okay okay okay okay actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two okay well well well things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So those those those well uh little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
