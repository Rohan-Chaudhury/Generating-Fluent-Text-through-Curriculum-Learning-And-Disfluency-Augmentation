Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly you know know weekly podcast and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing subscribing as so okay far and want to touch another thing that I did last last week. I made you know a mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about about the meme she put out okay and about be kind and I notice when I I listen back to it that like I said be nice. It's not a big big mistake. It's not a big difference, but um You know my OCD kicked in in and I kind of wanted to set it right to like talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
