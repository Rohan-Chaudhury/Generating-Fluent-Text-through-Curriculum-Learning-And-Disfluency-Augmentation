Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release release release release um you know so for me, it's all about the music and I forget forget forget forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography so you know well and I don't don't don't don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to the okay you know so so so so songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower when when when when you know uh well I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training training training training gym, I just try so okay like and listen to the music as many times times times times as possible, but I'm not even thinking you know well okay about the the the the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just it's just it's just it's just filled filled filled filled music and I mean so okay what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks um well so will come up and you you you you don't know what that's going to be or when it uh okay you you you you know will be but it just happens after you listen to it for a while and and and and um okay so then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the the the the choreography when so uh so those two things come together and you teach teach teach teach your already naturally in the you know like um music. So those little moments that that that that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
