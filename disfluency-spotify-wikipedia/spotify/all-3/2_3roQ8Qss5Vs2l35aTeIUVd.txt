Couch couch. There's you know so six of us in this household and this couch is is is falling apart. You're supposed um uh to sit on a couch not walk on on on it not run on it I mean so now jump on it and dance on on on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. I mean um. It's for it's it's it's for it's for sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because because because they know well like they're not supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but but but do a well I mean little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when you you you catch them, I have a tendency um um to overdo it. I'll tell tell tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
