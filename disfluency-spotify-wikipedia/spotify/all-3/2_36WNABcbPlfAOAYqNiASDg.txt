If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show show show notes in okay uh a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and and and I opened it. I you know uh was reading it through and it said if if if anyone ever comes to you saying well uh all is well. They're from Satan Satan Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that habit of well um of of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And so okay. Okay okay. So what so what so what um like I'm getting at is are there good good good angels and bad angels and we want um uh to remind you that that that that there is a stream of well-being which you are allowing um like or not. Not not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason are standing um you you you know in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that that that stream of well-being okay uh because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that that that is so you is so um I mean painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
