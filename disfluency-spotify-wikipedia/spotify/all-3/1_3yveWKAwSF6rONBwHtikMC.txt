Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today and today I'm I'm interviewing uh had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is is like he do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you you do? uh Yes, uh Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the the a-levels bought everything else had like girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. Skill. That you have to learn especially so when doing gcses and a-levels. So I so I I have some days where I meant to you know be in three meetings at at once which can be quite challenging. So I so I do need uh to have ways ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
