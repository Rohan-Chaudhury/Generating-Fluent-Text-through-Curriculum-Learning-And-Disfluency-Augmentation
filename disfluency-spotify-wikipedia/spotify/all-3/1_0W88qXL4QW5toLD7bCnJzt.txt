Hey dedicated listener to The Machinist therapy hotline, as you can imagine when we we so are recording our podcast. We have we have hours of audio that we we have to sift through more so often than not the level of conversation is at such such a high intellectual point uh that we're not sure if it really can get into into the podcast. We thought like we might share one of them with you now, but but remember if you want to well be involved, don't forget. You send us a a DM. Send us your questions and we'll so go from there. We hope you enjoyed enjoyed today's episode. Thanks. I did I did um the whole sort of winning the the Florida when the Clear Water went down.
