I like well uh these episodes because we don't really go through the the the chronological career of the competitor well like or the coach that we interview in in in this case. We interviewed. And since it was so uh the second time we had had had him on we'd already covered his career. And so I mean you know I got got got to talk about a lot of things on this show and I had so so so so I'd get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on a lot of of of different so like things and we kind of went through a couple topics one was was was his little brother Greg like I mean just want his fifth State title High School in in in New York.
