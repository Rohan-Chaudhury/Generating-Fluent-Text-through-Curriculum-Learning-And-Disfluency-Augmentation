But for the most part very very very very few things I mean um so surprise me. It is it is it is it it it it is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt like I mean I I I I mean here towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 19 19 19 okay uh so following it says this and the evening of that first first first first day of the week like you know you know when the disciples were together together together together with the doors locked for fear of the jews.
