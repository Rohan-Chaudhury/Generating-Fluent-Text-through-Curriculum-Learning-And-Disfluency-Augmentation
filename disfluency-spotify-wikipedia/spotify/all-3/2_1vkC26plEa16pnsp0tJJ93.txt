Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your I'm your I'm your host Justin Justin Justin Boon to well uh leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL NFL NFL combine is over. We're recording this on um well Monday morning. So at this this this point we've at least had a couple days you know well to digest some some some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what so well we're going going going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. You know I mean. Mean mean. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate like like like okay you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly Incredibly Incredibly talented um uh athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just it's it's it's just it's just an example, but they're okay I mean / like fractions of of of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view of a so so so well player but we did learn some things some players had much better showing well well well you know than others. So I so I so I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
