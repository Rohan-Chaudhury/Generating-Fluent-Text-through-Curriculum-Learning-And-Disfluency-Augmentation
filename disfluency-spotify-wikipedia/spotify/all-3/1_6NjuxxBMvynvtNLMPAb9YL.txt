Salute up, salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a a release like for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I um forget forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened listened like to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm okay okay in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm uh uh training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times times as um possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work work so out. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or or like lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and and you don't okay know what that's going to be or when it will be but but it just happens after you know you listen to it for a while and and then when you actually then go right let's okay plug in and learn the the choreography when those two things come together and you you know teach your already naturally naturally in the music. So those so those little moments that your son um or little hit movement movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
