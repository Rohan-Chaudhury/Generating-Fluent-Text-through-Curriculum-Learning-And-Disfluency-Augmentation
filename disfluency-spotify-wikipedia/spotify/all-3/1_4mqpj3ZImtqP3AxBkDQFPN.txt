Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like not not like a like regular Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. Listening. I have I have had um some shit on my mind per usual that I wanted wanted to share of one uh of which is the fact that I have literally not not had a job for so the past. Really long time and like my adult life probably probably aside from like I mean a gig here and a gig there to to the disappointment of my mother well and my bank account. I have not consistently been been working and I think well that's for a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
