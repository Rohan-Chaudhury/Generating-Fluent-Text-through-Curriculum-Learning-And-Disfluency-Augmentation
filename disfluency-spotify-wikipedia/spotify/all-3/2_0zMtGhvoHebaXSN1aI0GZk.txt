It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within within within a like okay small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy energy energy needed by like um every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an an an organism cannot produce um okay enough energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This can can can this can this can have a negative impact you know you know on osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients you know know know um as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a a a high concentration. Uh so. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high high high the pancreas releases like you know the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and and and muscle tissues detect the presence of you know okay insulin these convert the excess glucose glucose glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that uh uh is insoluble and can be stored stored stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a uh okay normal normal normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
