Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree and and I became so good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at at Cal State Long Beach okay Bree was actually taken the course because she was was preparing to apply to occupational um therapy school. She has recently been admitted and we we are so proud of her Bree uh also has a background in kinesiology, which which is what she studied for her uh undergraduate major and when she was still still studying that she also played basketball NCAA Division I mean II at Cal State East East Bay. So this so this woman has a lot of knowledge about I mean not not only how to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. We're going to dive you you know into some of the ways in which she's faced some really tough situations and and she's uh had to pull out that inner strength to keep going in in the face of some situations okay where she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
