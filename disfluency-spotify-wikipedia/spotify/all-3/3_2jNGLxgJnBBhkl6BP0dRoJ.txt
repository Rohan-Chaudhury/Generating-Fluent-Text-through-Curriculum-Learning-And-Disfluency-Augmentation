Hello everyone today. I'd like I'd like I'd like I'd like to share a a a a simple podcast about effective execution of strategy. You know like okay. So their focus is is is is all about execution of strategy. Okay, many people come up with like okay so great great great great ideas. Great strategies great initiatives and every year they spent countless hours okay you you you you know so countless efforts of prepare. During creating recreating the till business plan or or or or even set of well okay uh strategic plans and sometimes they also also also also hire very expensive Consultants to do so, so so I mean but the problem is is is is sometimes most of the effort goes to waste why because like um well they don't really really really really put extra effort to make sure that they do have a systematic approach to follow up follow through.
