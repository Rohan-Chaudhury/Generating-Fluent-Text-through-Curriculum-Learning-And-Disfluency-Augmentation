Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or or try well to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of of that going well on in the world today. As a as a matter of of fact, the inspiration behind this I mean podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular regular folks through personal stories that being real I mean being vulnerable and being true to to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the opposite. Like. We believe that true strength is is revealed through our ability to continue to grow I mean through our struggle struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder that in uh our Darkest Hours Hours when we can't see the way out when our backs okay are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
