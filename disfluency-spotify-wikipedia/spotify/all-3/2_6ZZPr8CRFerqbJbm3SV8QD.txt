Moans and moans and moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with moaning moaning moaning with moaning with you within you grunting as we breathe. So well. Screams Screams Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You come okay you you you know and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and and and um I mean you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds sounds sounds of making love um well my breath is a fucking that you're you're you're not forget. Your breath the Breath of so so Life kissing my lips. You're You're You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher than um like like like the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
