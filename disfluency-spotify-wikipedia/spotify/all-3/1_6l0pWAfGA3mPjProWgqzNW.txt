Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may ask ask okay that is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven like like years old Nate nasty couple of nicknames. He had he had gotten Natan a sty sty Fergus like Ace Qbert Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of of nicknames and I assure okay you I'm going to tell you those stories from all all over. The years but the like reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is is because he has a uh propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four four weeks at a time okay or maybe even a couple days when I get my my sad boy moments. I'm talking six like months to a year. This man can disappear at times. Times. He has a lot of um stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
