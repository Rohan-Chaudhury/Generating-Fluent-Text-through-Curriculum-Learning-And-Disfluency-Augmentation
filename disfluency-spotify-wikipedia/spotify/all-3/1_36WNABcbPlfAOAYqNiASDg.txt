If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes notes I mean in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and and I opened it. I so was reading it through and it said if anyone anyone ever comes to you saying uh all is well. They're from they're from Satan and I'm I'm thought thinking you kind of have that uh habit of of of telling us all all is well and your own words. And so so okay. So what I'm getting at at is are there good angels and bad angels um and we want to remind you that that that there is a stream of so well-being which you are allowing or not. Not. And what we've noticed about any who for okay whatever reason are standing in a a place where they are not allowing their alignment with so that stream of well-being well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that um is so you is is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
