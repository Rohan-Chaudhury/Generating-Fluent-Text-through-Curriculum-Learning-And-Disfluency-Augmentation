That's right. I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back back back back back back back back back back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back with another episode of med school radio radio radio radio radio radio radio radio radio radio and we're looking at some you know you know like like I mean you you you you you you you you you you know okay um so more educational objectives. Let's get right to it starting with with with with with with with with with with fragile X syndrome. What is um so well like uh um okay like I I I I I I I I I I mean this caused by this is caused by an increased number of cgg trinucleotide repeats repeats repeats repeats repeats repeats repeats repeats repeats repeats on I mean okay um so you know okay um I mean like the the the the the the the the the the fragile X. Mental retardation Gene and that is fmr1 on the long arm I I I I I I I I I I mean uh uh like uh um okay okay uh of the X chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome chromosome and this leads to hyper methylation and inactivation of fmr1. So okay so okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so okay you know so um I mean uh you know well. So remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember these cgg trinucleotide repeats fragile X mental retardation fmr1 gene on the long arm. Leading to hypermethylation and.
