together growing together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the the gospel how Jesus you know after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in in the following day he gets like up and he goes to the mountain to to pray to be with God to be with the I mean father in prayer. Prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the father well in prayer, prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him and he says to to like him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I needed to be with I I mean the father but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely absolutely interesting that I like would like us to unpack. It is it is the attitude attitude of Jesus in picking the uh day. He begins it by being with God the father father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
