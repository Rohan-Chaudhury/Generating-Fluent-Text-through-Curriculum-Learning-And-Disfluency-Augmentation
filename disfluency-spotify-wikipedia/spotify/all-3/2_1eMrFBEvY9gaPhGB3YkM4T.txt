Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very very very I mean okay traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up up up organism right in front of uh I mean my eyes. I just sat in my my my booth we reading the rules again. And I mean okay again, it was so so so dark in here that I had to use the small um um lamp on on on the table next to me. They really they really they really need to fix the lights lights lights here. I mean like. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first first first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It okay you know didn't do much much much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first the first the first so so so I mean thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement movement movement in like uh my peripheral vision. They got they got they got closer as as as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
