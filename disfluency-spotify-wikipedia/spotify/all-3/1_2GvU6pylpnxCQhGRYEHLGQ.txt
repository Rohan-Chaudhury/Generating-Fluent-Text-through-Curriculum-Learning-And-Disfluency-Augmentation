Welcome to the March 3rd 2020 edition of coronavirus questions answered with dr. Brian mcdonough. McDonough. Here's uh here's uh where we are at this very moment. We know we know know that in the United States I mean the death toll has climbed to 9 9 in addition. We know that those cases uh are based in Washington state at at a nursing home in Seattle. Most have occurred. The um number of infections in the United United States overall have climbed past a hundred. They're okay scattered across 15. It's with with it's with 27 cases in Washington state alone. As I mentioned that I mean states states getting hit very hard, but it's not the only one the nursing home outbreak like like apparently seated the first case in North Carolina and Wake County resident who had had um visited the Washington State nursing home tested positive but is in isolation at home and doing well. So, where are we now what's going on?.
