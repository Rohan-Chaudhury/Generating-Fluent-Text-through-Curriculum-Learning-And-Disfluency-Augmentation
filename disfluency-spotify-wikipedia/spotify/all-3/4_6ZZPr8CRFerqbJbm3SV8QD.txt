Moans and groans the the the the the sounds of making um well um you know love my breath is a a a a a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath of Life you know so so so so so you know um kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high high high high high higher than like well like so the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down down down down down by rain. Then you then you then you then you then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
