Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If If you I mean follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you you then you will know that I post so regular devotionals in the mornings to to encourage us with the word of God. And you and you know that is basically the the whole heart of this podcast will be looking at real you know life scenarios and situations, situations, but the End of that, we'll be using and like speaking very specific scriptures scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart behind this well is that as as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously avoid but we I mean mean will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. I am I mean mean so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
