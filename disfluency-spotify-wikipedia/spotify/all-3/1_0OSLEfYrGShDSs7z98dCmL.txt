Hello, so hello, so turns out that people do actually want to listen to to what I uh have to say, which is pretty shocking because my own boyfriend doesn't doesn't listen to so what I ever say, so there's a surprise but I'm glad that that everyone I mean is on board and I'm excited for this little journey this this little educational I mean Journey that we are going to go on together. I've done done a little eye. Like so organizing and like note books and stationery and stuff and lists. Lists. So I've so I've done list of how so I want it to pan out out whether or not it pans out like that is another okay story because I can can be a little bit impulsive. So we so we shall see but I well well want you to shut your eyes everyone that's listening. Please unless you're driving. If If um if um you're driving, please do not show your eyes, but shut your eyes and remember the last time that you ate.
