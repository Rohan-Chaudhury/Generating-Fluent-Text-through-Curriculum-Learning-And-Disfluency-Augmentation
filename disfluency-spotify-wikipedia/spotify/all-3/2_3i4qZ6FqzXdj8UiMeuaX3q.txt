Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm your host host host well I mean Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock central.com Kyle and Taylor here here here to uh so talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite impressive 12-point 12-point 12-point home victory over the Mississippi State uh well Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the again, the the the again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and they did did did like you know and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for south. South South. Carolina they got up big early well I mean and then they squandered almost every single ounce ounce ounce of that lead going into halftime and like you know then by the second half half half things kind of evened out in South Carolina, they you know so didn't Coast because you you you know, they only won by 12 and most of the um like time they were up up up by like six or something like that but it I mean so felt comfortable comfortable comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but you know I I I mean a lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and as much as as as we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
