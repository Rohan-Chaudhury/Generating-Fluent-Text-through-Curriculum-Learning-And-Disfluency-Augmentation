together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how okay okay okay okay Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day okay okay okay um he gets up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be be be with I mean well God to be with the father in prayer. And when you had had had gone up like um to be with the father in prayer, he went there to to to pray and Simon I mean okay Peter comes to him and he says to to to him we've been looking for you okay so and Jesus says while I needed to be be be with the father but also need to like so go somewhere else. They something absolutely absolutely absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. Uh you know. It is is is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by uh like being with with with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
