Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the the the the topic like well I mean of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and and and and closure. What kind what kind what kind what kind of interesting okay you know know know know um email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and telling so so so so um okay me how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation situation situation situation where um you know uh I guess his he's been married. And he's in the process process process process of getting a I mean you know I mean divorce with his wife and apparently apparently apparently apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she well um I mean was having having having having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing is uh uh uh uh like you know he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with with with with the divorce, but you know uh so the interesting thing is he's hanging out out out out having fun and hooking up with his so you know so wife without any kind of of of of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
