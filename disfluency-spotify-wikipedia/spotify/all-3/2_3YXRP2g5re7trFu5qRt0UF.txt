You so well know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because because because we're just here to so so serve each other to get this money and then we we we walking apart. So uh I mean it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success success success when you ask that question, you so I mean know was a success not enough enough enough to sustain it. I don't think uh I mean it was enough because we just just just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each I mean well other.
