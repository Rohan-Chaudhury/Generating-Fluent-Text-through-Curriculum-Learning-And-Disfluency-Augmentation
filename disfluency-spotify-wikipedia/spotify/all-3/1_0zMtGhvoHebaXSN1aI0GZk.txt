It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within within a um small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed needed by every living okay cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose levels uh are too high. This can can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is so the movement of water between between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through okay the pancreas. The body body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood so glucose if the concentration concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone I mean insulin into the the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these okay okay convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that that so is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the the so pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
