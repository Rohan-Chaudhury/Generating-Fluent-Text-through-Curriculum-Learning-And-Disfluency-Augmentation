At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a Southern Southern okay state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about about six feet deep you know outside and inside their house one family spent its time time sitting on the porch roof okay watching the wreckage Float by the young son son happened to notice a nice Straw Hat as it so went downstream. My he thought I'll I'll bet that person who lost that hat well is very sorry now after the Hat Hat had floated out of sight. Around uh the corner of the house the boy kept on on watching the river suddenly much you know to his surprise. Here comes the the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very you know strange. So the the so the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner so so of the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came came it came well back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
