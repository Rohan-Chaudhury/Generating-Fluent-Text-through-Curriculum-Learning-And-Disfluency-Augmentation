It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels I I I I I I I I I mean well well well well like like you know within a small range Lucas is important important important important important important important important important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by like okay like okay um like um um um um um um um um um like every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot well well well well well well well well well I mean uh um I mean you know so okay produce enough energy if blood glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose levels are too high. This can this can this can this can this can can can can can can can can can this can this can this can this can have I mean okay you know know know know know know know know know I mean um okay like um a negative impact on osmosis, which is is is is is is is is is the movement of water between cells by like well like um um um um um um um um um um um um I mean affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. The body body body body body body body body body can detect if there is so well like uh uh so I mean like like like like like like like like like a high concentration. Enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood enough blood enough blood enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too too too too too too too too too high well um you know well you know well like well the pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle like okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so uh well okay like tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the the the the the the the the the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen uh uh so okay uh um okay um as a a a a a a a a a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this you you you you you you you you you know um well you know like you know um like process continues until until until until until until until until until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
