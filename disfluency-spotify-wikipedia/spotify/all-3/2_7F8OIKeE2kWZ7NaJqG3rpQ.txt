He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and and and other okay I mean religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and and and order to reinvent like I mean religion for myself. Okay story time. I was was was driving to visit a friend while um um listening to to the excellent excellent excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I uh I mean highly recommend for for for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the so uh speakers speakers speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So uh like instead instead instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's you you you know so only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so so so podcasts because I'm not so well the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
