I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of of um this podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this this um podcast. I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about about random stuff, you know you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. Title. But then as I like recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I I started to figure out what like the theme of this podcast should be. Be. So if you know notice a lot of so the things that we covered from from the past few episode is about mental health uh growing up and things we we deal with as a teenager or as a young well adult. So with that said the new new title of the podcast will be basically I mean growing up. I finally finally I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should um be. So So basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto I mean the podcast and and basically having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
