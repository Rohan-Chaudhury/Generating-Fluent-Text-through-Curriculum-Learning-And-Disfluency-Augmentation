Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so so so tune out if uh like you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season season season couple weeks ago. I reported so I mean that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming filming filming something with a production crew Link in I mean uh the description and I I I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was like you you you know certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Claire Claire Crawley okay okay was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this this this straight. Maddie like I mean was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's she's she's not the Bachelorette so she has like okay to be the winner of this season, season, season, right? Is there is there is there any other reason Maddie you know so would would would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see see see okay okay no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your you you you know well thoughts down in the comments below.
