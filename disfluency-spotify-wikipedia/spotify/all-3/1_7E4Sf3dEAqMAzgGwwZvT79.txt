Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic topic um of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I got got an email like here from a client of mine that I've been coaching coaching for is probably so since late last year by eight eight nine months. Months. I guess. I've been coaching him so now. Well maybe well maybe longer so so he sent me this email and he's got a um couple of situations that that he's asking me about so he basically he meets his All uh at a concert and and I guess his group and her group of friends kind of okay emerged at some some point, and she listened this. She says she says that she told him to to uh text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
