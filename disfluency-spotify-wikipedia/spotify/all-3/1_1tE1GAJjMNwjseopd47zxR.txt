Hello and welcome to be on the borderline. This is the podcast dedicated to to exploring you know in a realistic and hopeful way what it's like to live live with borderline personality well disorder and other mental health problems. My name is Celine Celine and I am uh your host for this podcast. I want to issue a Proviso Proviso at the beginning you know of the Podcast which is that this is absolutely absolutely not a substitute for professional mental well health and medical intervention. So, please please seek out those sources of support if you um need them. And I also want to mention that I will be discussing topics such as self-harm and suicidal ideation.
