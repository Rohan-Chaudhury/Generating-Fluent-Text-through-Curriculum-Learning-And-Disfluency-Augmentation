Hey y'all. Welcome to welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a I'm I'm a fucking week okay late. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last last week I came to okay New Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. Grind. It was it was just a lot of like stuff going on and and I could have recorded like the days after but I had well so much much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. Uh. Uh. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people that I see in in um a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in uh uh New Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews nephews well and it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my uh uh house and no one's here right now, which is kind of rare. So I'm like like trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
