It's been it's uh been a pretty eventful like week, I guess since we last last recorded. Yeah, and okay we recorded this coming episode. This guests really really early. We We did we did. This is like actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, process, but this little Snippets recorded after you know your episode. Halftime, so we actually did have have our guests on a little bit earlier uh this week. Yeah, when he was was here because of the way that you know, this uh Gus could make it around around but you know, we're recording the intro after we record well the actual actual episode. Typically. We like to record the intro this this snippet part without the the um guest even being around. Yeah. So it just the way it works. So So usually we I mean recorded before the guest shows up this last step the set set this guess we like didn't have time to yeah. But anyways, how was how was your week bit how how things been for you?.
