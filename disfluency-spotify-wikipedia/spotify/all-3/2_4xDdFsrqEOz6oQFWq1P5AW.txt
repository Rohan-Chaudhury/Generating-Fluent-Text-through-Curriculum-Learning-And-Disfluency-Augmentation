But also quarter um I mean extremity movement violations, we're going to dive specifically specifically specifically today into the importance of I mean you know it and where to look in in in a handful of different movements. So Fern so Fern so Fern first question question question so um I have for you is when were you first introduced to the the the concept? out of quarter you know you know extremity the book definition of of of it at the level 1 course, however physically introduced to it you know um um um probably day one is an athlete like as a little kid. They just don't don't don't teach okay I mean it that way but when you teach any type of throwing throwing throwing mechanics, typically the first thing so uh you teaching most kids to do is probably probably probably jumping or throwing something right. So throwing so throwing so throwing a football or baseball as a child and and learning how to do that. That's.
