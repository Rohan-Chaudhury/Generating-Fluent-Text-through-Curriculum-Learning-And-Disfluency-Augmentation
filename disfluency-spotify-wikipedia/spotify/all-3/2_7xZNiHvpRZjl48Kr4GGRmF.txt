Hey everyone, hey everyone, hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with with with Erica and Shay. I well like have just some random stuff. I want us to to to talk about before we talk about like um um life. So last so so so last so last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica Jessica Jessica Simpson okay like book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't don't don't have to say I mean you know anything in case you haven't read but we we we totally recommend it Shea tell uh you know me if you would rather be Nick Lachey Lachey Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's I mean so back home - if I were John John John Mayer, I would be under a rock I mean so right now. I I I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just uh um to to to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I I mean you you you know went down when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. Bad bad. I went you know okay to his Instagram because I don't know in my head head head as I'm reading the book. I'm like I'm like I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the all the all the comments are.
