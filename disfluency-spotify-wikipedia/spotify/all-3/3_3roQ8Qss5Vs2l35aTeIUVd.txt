Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the the the the like uh okay things well, there's many things but one of the one one one one of them that bothers me uh so so that the kids do would be be be be standing or walking on the couch. There's I mean so so six of us in this this this this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're you're you're you're supposed to um you know uh sit on a couch not walk on it it it it not run on it now jump on I mean you know well it and and and and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for uh you know know know know okay sitting that's it. So when so when so when so when you catch them doing doing doing doing it because they know I mean like so they're not supposed to but they just just just just can't help themselves, but do a little skipper. Okay okay well. Ooh on ooh ooh ooh ooh on ooh on ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have have have have a tendency to overdo it. You know so so. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
