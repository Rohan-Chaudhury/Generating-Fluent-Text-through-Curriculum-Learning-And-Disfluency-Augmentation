What is what is what is what is what is what what what what what what what is what is this caused by this is caused by an increased number of cgg cgg cgg cgg cgg cgg cgg trinucleotide I mean you know um like like so repeats on the fragile X. Mental Mental Mental Mental Mental Mental Mental retardation Gene and that is fmr1 on the well I mean okay well well well well well well well I mean like long arm of the X chromosome and this leads to hyper hyper hyper hyper hyper hyper hyper methylation and inactivation of I mean uh well you know uh so fmr1. So remember so so so so so so so remember so remember so remember so remember so remember so remember these cgg trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide repeats fragile X mental retardation fmr1 gene on the long arm. Leading to leading to leading to leading to leading to leading to leading to hypermethylation and.
