Now Sports now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is is the fires well are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in in first place of um the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in in first place due to well the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that like would make the most sense, but of course course not listen, I don't care if I mean technically they're not in first. All All I care about is when you look at um the points it is tied. Tied. This very moment and just the fact that that like is the situation we we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the so the the so Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a a back-to-back you know back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
