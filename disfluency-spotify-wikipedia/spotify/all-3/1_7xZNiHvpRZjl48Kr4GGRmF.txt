Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and shay. Shay. I like I like have just some random stuff. I want us to to talk about before we talk so about like life. So last episode we both both talked about how we were reading the so Jessica Simpson book open book book Shay. My question my question is no spoilers. We don't have to say anything anything so in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell me if if you would uh rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back home home - if I so were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. Now. I even went to like his Instagram account. I don't follow him just just to see if people were commenting. That's like so the rabbit hole. I I went down when I read this but that bad it's not so that bad. I went went to his Instagram because I don't know in my head as okay I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
