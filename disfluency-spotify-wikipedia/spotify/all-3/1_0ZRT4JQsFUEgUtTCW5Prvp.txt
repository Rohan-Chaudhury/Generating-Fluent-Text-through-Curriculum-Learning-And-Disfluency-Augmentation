It is is uh Thursday, March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a a little like pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk talk after the um Leafs loss in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had had won three in a um row prior The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, Yeah, it does but you have so to sort of reflect on the fact fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that uh we're key games against against teams that were at least on par with them Florida a okay okay few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver Vancouver okay who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come come up against okay the team and they play three teams on this west coast swing swing that are out okay of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string and and they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks.
