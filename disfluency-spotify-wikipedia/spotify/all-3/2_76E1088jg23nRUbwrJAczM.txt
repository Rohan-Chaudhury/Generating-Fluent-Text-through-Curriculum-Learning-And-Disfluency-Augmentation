Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be well well well um explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become um um um well more masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that that that this is so uh such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays nowadays nowadays how to actually control so like their Destiny or how to actually control their fate fate fate so that way they're in control I mean well of what they would like and and and as a man this is important to um so your success. This is ridiculously ridiculously ridiculously important to your happiness. And not and not and not only that if you you you want to well um become a man of value so that way other other other men or other people in general I mean uh can lean on you. You're going to to to have to learn this. So here's so here's so here's the uh um deal. Deal deal. If you if you if you don't have a very high attention span, if you're you're you're a person who I mean uh cannot sit there and focus for two to to to five minutes, you're not going so well to do very well. Okay, because this video video video might take me a little you know uh bit to explain so grab a pen pen pen grab a paper. If you can't take five like well to ten minutes to to to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
