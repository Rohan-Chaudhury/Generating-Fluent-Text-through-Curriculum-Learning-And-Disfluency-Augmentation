Welcome back to emerge today's guest probably needs no introduction. For those of you who who have so been following the podcast for some time as speaking with Robert Robert Keegan Robert or Bob uh Keegan. It has a long history of working in in the field of adult development. And well if you're not familiar with Bob's work, you will will be after listening to this um show. We do a kind of Action to to his work an overview of the 5 so stage model that he created and that that has been studied empirically for the last 40 well years. And the reason why I I wanted to talk to Bob Keegan isn't just because you okay know, he's kind kind of a huge inspiration for me but also because I wanted to have his voice in the mix at the very beginning of this.
