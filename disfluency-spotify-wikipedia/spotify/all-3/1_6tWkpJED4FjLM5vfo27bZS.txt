The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay Lindsay you know emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which which included her reading shockingly uh racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating repeating the second was handled Tastefully but both uh fans of the show and alumni alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation so fans think it's completely unreasonable unreasonable for the show to have its cake and eat it too okay with one one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying how the producers uh run run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the show taking um no accountability accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners um are producers take any any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The show like is specifically designed designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You can't you can't um guarantee guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season there I I mean will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and and then so confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
