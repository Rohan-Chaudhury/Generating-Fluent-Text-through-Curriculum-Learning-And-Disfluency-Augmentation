So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, and and and yes, and yes, uh uh I have a coach coaches need coaches and I I I was talking to my well like coach because I had been feeling really stuck stuck stuck in some feelings about parenting and you know well how hard it can be sometimes and and and I realized I had allowed myself to well okay fall into this pattern of of of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, um um which I I I know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a uh uh uh I mean loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to to to so um me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then then then has okay you know been so powerful that he just knew that I had to share share share it with you. So that's so that's so that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
