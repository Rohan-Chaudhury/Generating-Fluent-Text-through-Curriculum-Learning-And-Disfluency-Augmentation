Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give I'll give I'll give you a little little little update on the so well John Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand thousand thousand four hundred twenty seven cases I mean so worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 40 40 7888 recovered and in the United States. We uh uh have now passed the the the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 cases confirmed with six deaths you know know know uh all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we haven't had any deaths deaths deaths in california. You know you know. And so there might be something specific look look look going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
