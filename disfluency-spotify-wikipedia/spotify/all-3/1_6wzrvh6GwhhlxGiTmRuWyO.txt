I have another friend with me today. She came came visiting uh for my health and lifestyle, you know, you have to get these things I I mean in order for the journey ahead and we were just having conversations about, about, you well know, doing things by yourself. Cough now, you know, there's this whole whole part like of it that says, you know, you have to collaborate and do do all those you know great things. But there's also the part of of you doing this goal this so particular goal by yourself, but me how far now now you know, so I mean, we're like just we're just going to flow today today and we just hope that you guys you know get what you need to from this podcast because the truth is sometimes the goal is not necessarily.
