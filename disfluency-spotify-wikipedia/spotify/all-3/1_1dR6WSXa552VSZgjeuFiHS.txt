Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is this is Walt talk. I'm so excited about about talking to you like about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion expansion assets. Love Theology and health uh because I believe that wealth is not not just about how much money you have in your bank account. Like. It's about establishing establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships okay and all all that good stuff. I get I get so many questions from people as uh uh I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is our time for for us to uh be together and for me to answer your questions. So here so here here we go dear well Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 15 years. We talked well about marriage. He's actually he's actually more vocal about it it than I am but it's a okay little frustrating when I see others getting married married and starting their families. I promise I promise I okay am genuinely happy happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
