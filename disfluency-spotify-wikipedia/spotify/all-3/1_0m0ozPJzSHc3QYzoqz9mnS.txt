The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls um um that were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me me how well we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you you know, like thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we we would like have had when we first started out this would have been way way way I mean easier and it's much easier. It is it is now now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor um is by far the easiest way to to make a podcast it gives you everything you like need. In one in one place place so you don't have to get Pro Tools I mean or any fancy recording recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast you know and edit edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So well so well it it gives you all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it like like sound good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean I mean we've recorded.
