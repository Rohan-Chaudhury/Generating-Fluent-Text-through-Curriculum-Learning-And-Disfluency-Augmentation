Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really appreciate appreciate so your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible Bible in you know this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, text, which is something like we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we we need I mean to talk about it more and today we're looking at. And And really interesting passage. You know. It's quite unlike everything else. We see we we see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 uh to 9, which is is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his so brother John and and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There okay in in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
