Perhaps the perhaps the most deceptively titled episode The Origin of Species was not not actually about the fucking word like genus species. But back but back to chapter 24 to to see what it actually is about today. So you know I hope you enjoy. Enjoy. Welcome to biology for bastards teaching biology and the most um profane way way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John Doe D. Thanks like for listening listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter at a time you know know this week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
