What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about so so the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S well well and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited I I mean about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out out to so the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this this episode. We were just so recording and we're talking about this new track track package that came out for the model like 3. It's like a $5,500 $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really well cool looking new tire. Hours for your your performance model 3 which already cost 60 I mean Grand and then you pay pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and uh these brake brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten you you know some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I and I I was just thinking like wow, there's um so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell so all of these fancy new features and and services that sort of Die Hard fans and I mean like Tesla nerds would love love and the track package is one example, but what like I think is is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
