Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so so so tune out if uh well you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks weeks weeks ago. I reported that uh um Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a a a production crew Link in the like uh description and I along with almost all all all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was like like certainly going to be 2020s bachelorette. Bachelorette Bachelorette. Well that well that well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley Crawley Crawley was well like announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this this this straight. Maddie was okay um filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not not not the Bachelorette so she has so so to be the winner of this season, season, season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie like I mean would have been filming this this this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see like you know no other other other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me let me let me know your thoughts thoughts thoughts down so uh in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on on on Bachelor News Daily. But okay um if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just just just did a deep dive on her earlier like so today. So check that that that out on this channel and make sure you check out our like uh Bachelor after after after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
