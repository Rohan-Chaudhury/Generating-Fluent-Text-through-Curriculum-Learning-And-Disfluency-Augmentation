Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. Surprised. I guess so there was a time. I think it was my 18th 18th birthday that that uh I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of of got stiffed it like out a little bit the day up. But for but for for the most part very few so things surprise me. It is difficult to imagine the the way that the disciples must. Have felt um here towards the end of chapter 20 and and the Book of John starting in verse 19 um following it says this and the the evening of that first day of the week like when the disciples were together together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus like came and stood stood among them and said peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
