A single asingle sardine cannot do much on its own accord. However, it however, it has has been told I so have read that back in the day a massive School School of sardines underneath the Golden Gate so Bridge was powerful enough. Enough a a school of sardines was powerful enough together to force so a large boat to stop stop in its tracks and push it the other um way tile friends. If you you if you want to change for better in this industry, if well you you want higher prices, if you wish people respected you more as a tile contractor, we have got to band together and unitedly turn this ship around.
