What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going we're going we're going going going to talk about I mean like the gross margin impact of a successful launch of of of the Plaid mode Model S you know well and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is is is something I'm really really excited about from I mean you know a financial perspective. So So So going to nerd out on this shout out to so I mean the third row row row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We well uh were just recording and we're we're we're talking about this new track package that came um uh out for the model 3. 3 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can I mean I mean basically get get get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which I mean you you you know already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more more more for these so okay new tires and these brake pads which are geared to to to make it perform better you know like on the track. It's gotten some awesome awesome awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I mean okay I was just thinking thinking thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort like uh of of of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and and and services that like you know sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love love love and the track um like package is one example, but what I think is is is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
