Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and and the topic of okay today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. Closure. What kind of interesting email well here from a guy who writes in in thanking me for my work and telling me okay how just in a short short period of time. He's in he's in a situation where I guess like his his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting a divorce like with his wife wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found he found out she um was having having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing is he's completely well well changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the interesting thing is is so he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife without any kind kind of you know attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
