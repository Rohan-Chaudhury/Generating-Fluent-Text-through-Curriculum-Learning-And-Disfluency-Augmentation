It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small small small small small small small small small small small range so like um well uh like okay so okay like Lucas is important for respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. Uh like okay uh I I I I I I I I I I I mean so uh okay like okay. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot produce enough energy I mean um uh like uh you know well well um well if if if if if if if if if if if blood glucose levels are too high. This can this can this can this can this can can can can can can can can can can can this can this can this can this can this can this can have a negative impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact on osmosis, you know well so okay well um I mean so um um which which which which which which which which which which which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh so uh I mean well like you know I mean um well blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high high high high high high high high high high high uh so okay um well so well okay well well concentration. Enough blood glucose if if if if if if if if if if if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas uh okay like um um um um um um um um um um um well uh you know well well um releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the the the the the the the the the the the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence um uh um uh well I mean uh okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay uh I mean of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a a a a a a a a a a a form of uh like I mean like I mean uh you know you know um um um um um um um um um um um I mean glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Later later later later later later later later later later. Use this process continues until I mean you know well um um so well well well well well well well well well well well you know I mean okay the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If If If If If If If If If If If the if the if the if the if the if the if the if the the the the the the the the the the the if the if the if the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
