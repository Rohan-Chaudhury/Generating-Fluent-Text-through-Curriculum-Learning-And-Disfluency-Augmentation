It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small small small small okay you know uh range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The The The The energy needed uh uh um by every living cell. If there is not enough enough enough enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy okay so uh if blood glucose levels are are are are too high. This can have a negative impact on well well you know osmosis, which which which which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as so so so so okay well blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there there there there is a high concentration. Um um uh. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is is is is too high the pancreas releases so um you know the hormone insulin into the bloodstream bloodstream bloodstream bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence so um uh of insulin these convert the the the the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form I mean so you know of glucose glucose glucose glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this like okay um process process process process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
