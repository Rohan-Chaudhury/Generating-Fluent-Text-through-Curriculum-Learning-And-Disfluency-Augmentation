They are are are are are are are are are are are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of I mean well you you you you you you you you you you you know you know like well okay I mean you know okay the Metropolitan. Well, technically technically technically technically technically technically technically technically technically technically technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to okay well I I I I I I I I I I I mean I mean you know like okay okay uh okay the tiebreak, which is crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because you know I mean I I I I I I I I I I I mean okay well like um uh so so that would make the most sense, but but but but but but but but but but but of course not listen, I don't um uh like I mean you know well well well well well well well well well well well you know I mean like you know care if technically they're not in first. All I I I I I I I I I I I care about is when you look okay um uh so so um you know so you you you you you you you you you you you know well at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact that that like like uh um um well I mean I mean well well is is is is is is is is is is is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So you know know know know know know know know know know know okay um okay okay well okay you know um you know the Flyers beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half so I mean so like so so so so so so so so so so so like uh like well so of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
