Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai Makai time major Nicole um today on the show. We're going to be talking about about gross rental yields in parnell. Uh. Now, you now, you might be wondering why why are we talking about Parnell given you know that which is an affluent suburb in in Auckland given that it is probably um not likely an investor suburb or a suburb suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a uh couple of weeks ago. I got the the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks you know in New Zealand and and they said can you comment on an article that we're writing for okay our website where where they were showing by the latest core logic data that the the I mean median median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a whereas whereas a one-bedroom um apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and and I mean they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
