Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had had had girl Izzie well uh Wilson about time management and how she does it. So So So is he do like uh you find it hard to balance time between all all all the stuff you do? Yes, um yes, um yes, um um it's very very very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else okay you know had had had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn you know know know I mean especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where where where I meant you know uh to be in three meetings at once which can can can be quite challenging. So I I mean I mean do need to have ways of of of getting around that which may involve meeting up with okay like whoever is chairing the the the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
