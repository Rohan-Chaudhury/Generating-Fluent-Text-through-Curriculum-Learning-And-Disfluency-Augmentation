Hi everyone. Welcome back to skincare Somali A's your favorite bi-weekly skincare podcast. Uh. I'm I'm Natalie and I'm Jessica this week. We are talking about what we I like so so to call the great exfoliation debate because we've got two different points of view view and we're uh going to Duke it out. Mano a mano this week. Week. We will also of so course do our wine pairing because we are your Somali A's A's and this week you know we're going with something a little bit more aggressive a little bit bit Bolder just like like exfoliation. I would like to recommend Santa Julia winemakers Reserve Mountain Mountain blend. That is a Malbec and cab Franc blend from 2016. It's just a little bit.
