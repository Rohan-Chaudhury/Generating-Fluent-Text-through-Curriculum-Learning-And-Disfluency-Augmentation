Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm I'm your you know host Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock Gamecock central.com Kyle and Taylor here I mean to talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite quite impressive 12-point home victory over the Mississippi so State Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the South Carolina Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and okay they did and it wasn't the the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they carolina they got well up big early early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that lead okay going into halftime halftime and then by the second half things kind of evened out in South okay okay Carolina, they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 and um most of of the time they were up by like six or something like that but I mean mean it felt comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but um um a lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and as much as as so we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
