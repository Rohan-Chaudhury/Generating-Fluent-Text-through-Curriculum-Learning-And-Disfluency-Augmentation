So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, yes, I you know have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my my coach because I okay had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how how hard it can be um sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall fall into this pattern um of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, way, which I know better okay than to do but I just kind of got caught caught in a loop and it's one of well my weaknesses. Well so well so so my coach said something to me so very profound and the shift like that it it has created since then has been so powerful that he just knew that I I I mean had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
