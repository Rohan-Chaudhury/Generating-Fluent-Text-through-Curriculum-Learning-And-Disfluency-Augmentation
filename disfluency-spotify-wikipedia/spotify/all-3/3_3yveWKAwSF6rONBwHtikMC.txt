Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing interviewing interviewing interviewing had girl like like uh Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does does does does it. So is he do okay like um you find it hard to balance time between all all all all the stuff you do? Yes, it's you know uh uh very tricky to balance my my my my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl like I mean you you you you know duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn learn learn learn especially when doing um I mean okay gcses and a-levels. So I have have have have some days where I meant to be in three meetings like I I I I mean okay at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have ways ways ways ways you know you know okay of getting around that which may involve meeting up up up up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
