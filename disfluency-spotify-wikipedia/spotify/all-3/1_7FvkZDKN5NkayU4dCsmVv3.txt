You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film you you know television and everything in between when my clients come into the the color grading sweet to work uh on their projects. They sit on this color couch couch of mine for an hour so a day or weeks on end depending on on the project those clients might be directors um writers producers or cinematographers. It varies varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On you know the project project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's sometimes it's color like like but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a a it's a you know glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will will talk about color um from time to time, but it's really about what brought my my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
