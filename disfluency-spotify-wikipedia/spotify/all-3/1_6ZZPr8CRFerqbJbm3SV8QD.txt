Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you I I mean grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the the tree um of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. Me. And well I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and and groans the sounds I mean of making love my breath is a fucking that you're you're not forget. Your breath the well Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps keeps me high. You make me high I mean higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
