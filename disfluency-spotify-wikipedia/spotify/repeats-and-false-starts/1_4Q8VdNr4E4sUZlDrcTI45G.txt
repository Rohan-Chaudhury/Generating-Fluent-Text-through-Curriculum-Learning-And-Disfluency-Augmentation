Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I I guess there was a time. I think I think it was my 18th birthday that that I I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little little bit the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. It is is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here towards the end of of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 following it says this this and the evening of that first day of the week when the disciples were together together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among among them and said peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
