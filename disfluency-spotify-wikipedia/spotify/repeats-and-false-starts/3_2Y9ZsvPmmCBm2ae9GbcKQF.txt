I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this this this this podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. Podcast podcast podcast. I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded recorded recorded recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme theme theme theme of this podcast should be. So if so if so if so if you know notice a lot of the things that that that that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and and and and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So with with with with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I I I I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So So So So basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and and and and basically having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
