Hello and hello and welcome back to the not another Runner podcast. Thank you so much for for joining today. I am so thankful that you have downloaded this episode and that you you choose to listen today. I've had I've had an awful cold all week. So hopefully I'll be able to to get through this introduction without losing my voice. So today's episode is something something I couldn't wait to publish. The guest today is a fellow Irishman the very first first wash guest of a podcast. And someone I have followed on social media for for a long while now. I'd actually heard of this guest back on another podcast podcast God over a year ago. Now whilst now whilst I was training for the London marathon and I I remember listening thinking wow, this guy is crazy like what he has achieved. I was just just bewildered by his achievements. He is an ultra runner from penarth Cardiff South Wales. His name is Reese Jenkins. He.
