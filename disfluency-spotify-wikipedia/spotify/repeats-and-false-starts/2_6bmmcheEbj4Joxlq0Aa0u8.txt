At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a Southern Southern Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six feet deep outside outside outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof roof roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw Straw Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he my he my he thought I'll bet that person who lost that that that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around the around the around the corner of of of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to his surprise. Surprise surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very strange. Strange strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of of of the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came back back back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the finally the finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
