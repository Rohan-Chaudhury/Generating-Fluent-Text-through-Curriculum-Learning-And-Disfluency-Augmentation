So tune out if you you you you you you you you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that that that that that that that that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the the the the the the the the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that that that that that that that that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Claire Claire Claire Claire Claire Claire Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let so let so let so let so let so let so let so let me get this straight. Straight straight straight straight straight straight straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so so so so so so so so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other other other other other other other other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right right right right right right right right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me me me me me me me me know your thoughts down in the comments below.
