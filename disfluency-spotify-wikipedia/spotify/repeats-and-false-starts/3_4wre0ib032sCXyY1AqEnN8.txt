Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or try try try try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that that that that going on in the world today. As a as a as a as a matter of fact, the inspiration behind behind behind behind this podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that that that that being real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the the the the opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to to to to grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder reminder reminder reminder that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when when when when our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
