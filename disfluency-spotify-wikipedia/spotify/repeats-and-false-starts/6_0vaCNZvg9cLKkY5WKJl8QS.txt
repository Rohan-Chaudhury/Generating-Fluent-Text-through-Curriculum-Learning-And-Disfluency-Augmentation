I can't wait for you guys to hear it. If this is is is is is is is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going back going back going back going back going back going back going back and listening to part part part part part part part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think that all of the information in in in in in in in part to her story all her tips the way that she parents it's all like like like like like like like so much more interesting and almost more like valuable when you know where she came came came came came came came from part 1 is all about her life as a young girl how she she she she she she she was parented her family story Dynamic her as a young woman and it's it's it's it's it's it's it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
