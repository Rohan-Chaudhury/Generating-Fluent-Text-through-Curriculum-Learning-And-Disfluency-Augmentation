Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the the Gospel reading from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an exegesis exegesis of the literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter 5 5 verse 43 to 48. Jesus said jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I I say this to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in in this way. You will be sons of your father in Heaven for he causes causes his sun to rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if for if you love those.
