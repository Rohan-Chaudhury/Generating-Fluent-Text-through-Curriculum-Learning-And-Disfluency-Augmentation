So is he do you find find find find find find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, it's it's it's it's it's it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else else else else else else had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to to to to to to learn especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant meant meant meant meant meant to be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do do do do do do need to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever whoever whoever whoever whoever whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
