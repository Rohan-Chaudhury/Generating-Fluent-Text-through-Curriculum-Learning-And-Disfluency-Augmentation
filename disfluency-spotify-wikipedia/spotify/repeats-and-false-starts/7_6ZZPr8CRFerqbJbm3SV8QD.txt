Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you you you you you you you you grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I I I I I I I I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the the the the the the the the sounds of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your Your Your Your Your Your Your Your breath the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make make make make make make make make me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you then you then you then you then you then you then you then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
