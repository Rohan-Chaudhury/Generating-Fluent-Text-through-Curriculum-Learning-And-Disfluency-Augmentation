I'm Jason, I'm Rosie. I'm Paula. I'm sin and this is thoughts and confessions. Confessions. Yo yo yo, what's up guys? What's up? What's up? So this week has has been very interesting for me. I also like I've been dealing with some some issues one can say towards in terms of anger in terms of when people would would say like Darkness. And just trying to find the ways for me to be able able to kind of marry that anger that I have inside with the positivity that that I also have inside. We all go through that I guess so how how deep it does the rabbit hole go super deep Bro Whitey. Yeah, like it's something something that like I sort of I think it started when I actually traveled to Trinidad this year. So I went through the Christmas.
