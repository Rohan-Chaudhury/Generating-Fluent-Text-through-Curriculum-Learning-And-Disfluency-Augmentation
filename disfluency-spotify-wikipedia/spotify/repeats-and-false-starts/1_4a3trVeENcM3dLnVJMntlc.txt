A single sardine cannot do much on its own accord. However, it has has been told I have read that back in the day a massive School of of sardines underneath the Golden Gate Bridge was powerful enough. Enough a school of sardines was powerful enough enough together to force a large boat to stop in its tracks and push it the the other way tile friends. If you want to change for better in this industry, if if you want higher prices, if you wish people respected you more as a tile contractor, we have got to band together and unitedly turn this ship around.
