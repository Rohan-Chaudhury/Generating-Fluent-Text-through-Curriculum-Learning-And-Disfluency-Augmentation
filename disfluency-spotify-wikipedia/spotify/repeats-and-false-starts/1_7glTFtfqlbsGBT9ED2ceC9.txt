So I go into the NFL after the demo demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one with Drew Brees Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and the AFC Championship Game Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This was the game that you could could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you play that demo. Demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty yeah, pretty much why you chose to be a broadcaster? Yeah, because because I chose to be a Broncos fan because well quite frankly because I have have a horse and I went and I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
