It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small range range range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. Cell cell. If there if there if there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose glucose glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is is is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through through through the pancreas. The body the body the body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood blood blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone hormone hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of of of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a a a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process process process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
