It's Brock sale from the Bronx Tale podcast. And today and today I'm going to to be telling you about my favorite app, which is Anchor. It's the best app to to use for any type of podcast. It's free. It's easy. You can use your phone phone computer or any other device to record it. And once you post the podcast, it it doesn't just go on acre. They post it on Spotify to get your podcast more more exposure and to help you out in my opinion. Anchor has everything you you need in one place and it is the best platform to create. Any any any any type of podcast I think this is episode 4. I don't know how how many episodes I've done. This is Braden. It's a hybrid. Nice to meet you you meet who? Yeah, I don't think anybody lists the rest doesn't matter. Yeah, fuck it. It. We're going we're going to talk about the combine that just happened and how the Panthers are are going to get the best pick in the draft again because they're picking it seven then that's where we pick Christian McCaffrey.
