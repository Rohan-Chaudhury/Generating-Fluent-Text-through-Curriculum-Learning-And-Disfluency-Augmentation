What does what does what does what does what does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it it it it it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through through through through through the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, room, room, room, room, which was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being being being being being students not our number one problem and really it was just bingo. Bingo bingo bingo bingo. So anybody could win and there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say say say say say I'm not too sure what is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind kind kind kind kind of curve that but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. Reads reads reads reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over there's over there's over there's over there's over a a a a a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
