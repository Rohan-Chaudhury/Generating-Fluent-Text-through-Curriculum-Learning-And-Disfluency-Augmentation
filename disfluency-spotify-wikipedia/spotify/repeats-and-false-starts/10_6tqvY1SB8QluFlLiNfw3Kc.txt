Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are are are are are are are are are are are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place place place place place place place place place place place of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due due due due due due due due due due due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it the tiebreaker because because because because because because because because because because because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't care if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when when when when when when when when when when when you look at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes makes makes makes makes makes makes makes makes makes makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on on on on on on on on on on on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
