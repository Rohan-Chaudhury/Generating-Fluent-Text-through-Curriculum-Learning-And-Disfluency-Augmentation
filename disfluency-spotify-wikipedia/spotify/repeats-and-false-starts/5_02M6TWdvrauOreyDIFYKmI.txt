I made made made made made made a mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme meme meme meme meme meme she put out and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to to to to to to it that I said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, but You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to to to to to to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
