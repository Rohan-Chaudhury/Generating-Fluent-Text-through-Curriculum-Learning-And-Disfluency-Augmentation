It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within within a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. Cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is the the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the the pancreas. The body the body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
