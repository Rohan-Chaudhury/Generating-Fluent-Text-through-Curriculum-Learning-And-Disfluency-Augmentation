Hello, my name is Emily Frandsen. Welcome to my nerd brain a dialogue on on musician's health and wellness. It's two days after Mardi Gras. We're all completely. It's really cold cold down here. But here we are. We are bad back in the podcast Studio at at Loyola University New Orleans for episode 7. I've been really excited and looking forward forward to this episode for a long time and I'm thrilled to announce that our guest guest today is singer-songwriter and guitarist Anders Osborne Anders. I would like to welcome welcome you to my nerd Marine. No, it's a pleasure to be in your warm little we're nerd brain. Thank you, Emily.
