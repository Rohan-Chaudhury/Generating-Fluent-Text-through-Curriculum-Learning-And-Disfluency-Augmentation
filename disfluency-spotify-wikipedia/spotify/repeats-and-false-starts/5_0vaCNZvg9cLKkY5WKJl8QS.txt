I can't wait for you guys to hear it. It it it it it. If this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going Going Going Going Going Going back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think think think think think think that all of the information in part to her story all her tips the way way way way way way that she parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost more more more more more more like valuable when you know where she came from part 1 is all about her her her her her her life as a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her as a a a a a a young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
