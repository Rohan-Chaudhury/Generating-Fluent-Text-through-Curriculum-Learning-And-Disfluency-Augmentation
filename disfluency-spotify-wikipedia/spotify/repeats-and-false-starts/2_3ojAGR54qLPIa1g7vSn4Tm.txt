So on this episode, I'm I'm I'm going to be doing something a little bit different I am going so I'm trying trying trying to put together this like algorithm. And so and so and so I just wanted to kind of film film film and put together. Kind of kind of kind of making it I guess is the best way way way to put it I mean so I've been looking into like I've talked about in the the the past I talked about in the last episode that I really am a big fan fan fan of the Bowman Chrome rookie cards. So not the Bowman Prospect cards the ones with the the the RC logo. So I was putting together some statistics with the PSA Pop reports reports reports and then the pricing of those specific cards, so Here's basically what I got, so like like like I was looking at like players basically I use trout as a baseline, but I think something that's when I originally made this.
