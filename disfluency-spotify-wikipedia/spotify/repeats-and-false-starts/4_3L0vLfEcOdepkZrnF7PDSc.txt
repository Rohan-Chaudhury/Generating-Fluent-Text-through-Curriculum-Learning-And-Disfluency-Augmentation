I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week week week week week I came to New Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was was was was was just a lot of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days days days days days after but I had so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had had had had had to go get my pap. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people people people people people that I see in a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then then then then then I'm staying in New Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here here here here here and nephews and it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in in in in in my house and no one's here right now, which is kind of rare. So I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
