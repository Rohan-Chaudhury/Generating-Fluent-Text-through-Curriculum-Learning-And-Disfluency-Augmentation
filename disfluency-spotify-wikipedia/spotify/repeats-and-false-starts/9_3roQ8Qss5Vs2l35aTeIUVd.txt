Sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, there's there's there's there's there's there's there's there's there's there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the kids kids kids kids kids kids kids kids kids kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six there's six there's six there's six there's six there's six there's six there's six there's six there's six of us in in in in in in in in in in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch couch couch couch couch couch couch couch couch couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance on it. It it it it it it it it it. Do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do WWF moves on it. It's for it's for it's for it's for it's for it's for it's for it's for it's for it's for sitting that's it. So when you you you you you you you you you you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they just can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on ooh on ooh on ooh on ooh on ooh on ooh on ooh on ooh on ooh on the couch, but when you you you you you you you you you you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
