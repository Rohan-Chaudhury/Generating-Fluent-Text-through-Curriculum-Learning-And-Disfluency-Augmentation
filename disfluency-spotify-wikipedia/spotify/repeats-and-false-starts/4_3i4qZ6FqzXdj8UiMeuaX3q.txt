Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and they they they they they did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina Carolina Carolina Carolina Carolina they got up big early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of of of of of that lead going into halftime and then by the second half things kind kind kind kind kind of evened out in South Carolina, they didn't Coast because you know, they only won won won won won by 12 and most of the time they were up by like six or something something something something something like that but it felt comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular spectacular spectacular spectacular spectacular performance but a lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and as as as as as much as we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
