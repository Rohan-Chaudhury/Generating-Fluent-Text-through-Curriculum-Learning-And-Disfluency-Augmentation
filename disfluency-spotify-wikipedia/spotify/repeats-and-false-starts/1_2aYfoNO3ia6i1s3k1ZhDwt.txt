Sunday seems to be our day where we really try to get our act together together before the work week. It includes the kids because we really enjoy our time time off on Saturdays and Sundays as a family and we just got a lotta lotta things that we tend to do on the weekends. We're busy but Sunday, especially given given against towards the evening as like look kids. Do you have any homework what what needs to be done for tomorrow? Get your clothes out clean your rooms. Let's start start packing lunches. Etc it's it's just a reminder that we gotta get back to work and and school tomorrow morning. I like teasing my kids at this time because it's a i i you guys. I know that school is your favorite. You guys you guys can't even wait to to go back and like know I hate school. I don't think they really do do like I think they like to see their friends. But yeah but yeah schools work and and their you're not in kindergarten anymore, right? We got through versus third grade.
