Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to to to to to be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to to to to to become more masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that that that that that this is such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how how how how how to actually control their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that that that that that way they're in control of what they would like and as a man man man man man this is important to your success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not and not and not and not and not not not not not only that if you want to become a man of value so that way way way way way other men or other people in general can lean on you. You're going going going going going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If you don't have a very very very very very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit there and focus for for for for for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very well. Okay, because this video video video video video might take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If If If If If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
