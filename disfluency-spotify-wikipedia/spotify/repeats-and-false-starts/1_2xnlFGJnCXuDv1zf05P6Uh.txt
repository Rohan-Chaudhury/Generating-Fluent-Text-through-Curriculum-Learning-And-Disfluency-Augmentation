What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode mode Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really really excited about from a financial perspective. So going so going to nerd out on this shout out out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
