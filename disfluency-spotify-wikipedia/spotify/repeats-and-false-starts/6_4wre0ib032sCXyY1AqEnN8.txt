We think there is enough of that going going going going going going going on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being real real real real real real real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's actually, it's actually, it's actually, it's actually, it's actually, it's actually, it's quite the the the the the the the opposite. We believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue continue continue continue continue continue continue to grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as as as as as as as a reminder that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out out out out out out out when our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
