Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree and I I became good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal State Long Long Beach Bree was actually taken the course because she was preparing to apply to to occupational therapy school. She has recently been admitted and we are so proud of her her Bree also has a background in kinesiology, which is what she studied for her undergraduate major major and when she was still studying that she also played basketball NCAA Division II at at Cal State East Bay. So this woman has a lot of knowledge about not not only how to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. We're going to dive into into some of the ways in which she's faced some really tough situations and she's she's had to pull out that inner strength to keep going in the face of some some situations where she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
