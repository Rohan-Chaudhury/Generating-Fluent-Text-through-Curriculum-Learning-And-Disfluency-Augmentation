Hi, everyone, what's happened? And I'm here with Johnny. Bargain has all she on on top and Blake all good. So today so today we are recording the first episode of the the podcast that we've been talking about recording for at least two or three months. Months. He has smelt a long story short may not going to be in touch for for a while and I made not for sample cups of coffee on the lisburn lisburn road and we thought that the ideas and the conversation we were having may help help a few older. So this is all very much part in those thoughts into action. Action. And if we can help at least one other person as a byproduct of of our conversations recording and Publishing it then we think this is a very valuable form form to do. So, so first of all, we're just going to basically introduce ourselves so so you can get to know us that more about who you actually listened to and and then down the line move very much want to delve into some of those deeper questions questions that may help others. So just by where personal introduction my name is Asha Monaghan. I'm from a gallon which is about 10 minutes from the organ.
