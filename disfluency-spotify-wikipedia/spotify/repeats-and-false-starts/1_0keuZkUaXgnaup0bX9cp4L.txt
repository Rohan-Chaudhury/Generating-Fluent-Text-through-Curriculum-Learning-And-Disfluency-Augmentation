Hi, POTUS. I hope I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability disability become so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is is a fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how how she came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way way that the World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were were born with may do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's it's basically the idea of ableism and how the world is set up for people who who are able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a a very specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a a really interesting conversation. I really I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate rate review And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
