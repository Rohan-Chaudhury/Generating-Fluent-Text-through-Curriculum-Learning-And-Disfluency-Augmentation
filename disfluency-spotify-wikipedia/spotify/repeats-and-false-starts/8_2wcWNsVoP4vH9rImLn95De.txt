So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And And and And and And and And and And and And and And and And and And And And And And And And And yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my my my my my my my my my coach because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how how how how how how how how how hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall fall fall fall fall fall fall fall fall into this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, which I know better than to do but I just kind of got caught caught caught caught caught caught caught caught caught in a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said said said said said said said said said something to me so very profound and the shift that it has has has has has has has has has created since then has been so powerful that he just knew that I I I I I I I I I had to share it with you. So that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
