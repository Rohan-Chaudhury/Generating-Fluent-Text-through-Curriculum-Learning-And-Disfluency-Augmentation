They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a day day day day day day day day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers writers writers writers writers writers writers writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. Work work work work work work work. On the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's sometimes it's sometimes it's sometimes it's sometimes it's sometimes it's sometimes it's sometimes it's color color color color color color color color but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse glimpse glimpse glimpse glimpse glimpse glimpse glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from from from from from from from from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did how did how did how did how did how did how did how did I get to this place in.
