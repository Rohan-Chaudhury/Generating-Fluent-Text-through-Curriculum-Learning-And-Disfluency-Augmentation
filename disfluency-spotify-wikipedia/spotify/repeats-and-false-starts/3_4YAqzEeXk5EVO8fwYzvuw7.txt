I want I want I want I want to mainly jump into the who what why when and and and and how of this podcast. So before so before so before so before you decide to listen to me, let me me me me at least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about 5 5 5 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a nursing nursing nursing nursing home from there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting setting setting setting working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice Practice Practice Practice World, which is really where I wanted to be I was able to to to to sit with people for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and and and and we were able to see each other for a bit more than five or ten minutes minutes minutes minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple couple couple couple minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because because because because they've been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
