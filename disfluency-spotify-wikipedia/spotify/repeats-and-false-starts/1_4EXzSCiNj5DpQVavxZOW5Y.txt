Hello guys. This is dr. William Cairo Bowl starting the first broadcast that that I'm going to be doing regularly once a week to cover the basic science of of the coronavirus and to review and sort of restore some of the sanity to the the conversation about this this illness in sort of the electronic discourse that goes About it it to try to just seal fact from fiction. There's a lot of Buzz right now now in the media. I believe that there's been a very severe, you you know response already like last week in the stock market and Wall Street, and I decided to do this podcast because I realized that.
