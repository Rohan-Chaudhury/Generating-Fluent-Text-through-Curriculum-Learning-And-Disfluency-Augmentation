Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with moaning with moaning with moaning with moaning with moaning with you within you grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. Life life life life life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I I I I I I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and moans and moans and moans and moans and moans and groans the sounds sounds sounds sounds sounds sounds of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the the the the the the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing you're breathing you're breathing you're breathing you're breathing you're breathing keeps me high. You make make make make make make me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
