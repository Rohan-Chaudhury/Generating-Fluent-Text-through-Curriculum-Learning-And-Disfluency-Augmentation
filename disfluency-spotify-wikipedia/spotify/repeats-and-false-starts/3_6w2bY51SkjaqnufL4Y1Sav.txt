See See See See if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is going to hell and and and and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have Adam Breeze of Raven I I I I with us but before we hop into that, I just wanted to go over over over over I sold myself short on the last episode about my romantic capabilities. I think think think think I came up on the last. Episode saying that I don't remember what I I I I got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards out, but but but but I personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got him a a a a heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got him Star Star Star Star Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
