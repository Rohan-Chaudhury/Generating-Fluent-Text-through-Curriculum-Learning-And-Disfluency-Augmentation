Maddie was maddie was maddie was maddie was maddie was maddie was filming filming filming filming filming filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be be be be be be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would would would would would would have been filming this is unconfirmed.
