Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl girl girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he do do do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, Yes, yes, Yes, yes, Yes, Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl girl girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing doing doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be be be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I so I so I do need to to to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
