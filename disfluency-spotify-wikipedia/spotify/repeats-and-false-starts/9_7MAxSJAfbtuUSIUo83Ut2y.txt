As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and and and and and and and and and and a half. What does what does what does what does what does what does what does what does what does what does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it it it it it it it it it it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the the the the the the the the the the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number number number number number number number number number number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there there there there there there there there there there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure sure sure sure sure sure sure sure sure sure what is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of of of of of of of of of of curve that but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody so nobody so nobody so nobody so nobody so nobody so nobody so nobody so nobody so nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
