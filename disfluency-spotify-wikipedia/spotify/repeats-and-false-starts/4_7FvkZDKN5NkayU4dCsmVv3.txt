You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and everything in in in in in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work work work work work on their projects. They sit they sit they sit they sit they sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a a a a a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be be be be be directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. Work work work work. On the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but but but but but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a a a a a glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color color color color color from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
