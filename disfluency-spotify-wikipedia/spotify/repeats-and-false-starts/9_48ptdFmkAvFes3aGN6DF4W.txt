And the memory verse is taken taken taken taken taken taken taken taken taken taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and greatest day day day day day day day day day day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who is thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation to come to Jesus Through Through Through Through Through Through Through Through Through Through the lens of the Greek text.
