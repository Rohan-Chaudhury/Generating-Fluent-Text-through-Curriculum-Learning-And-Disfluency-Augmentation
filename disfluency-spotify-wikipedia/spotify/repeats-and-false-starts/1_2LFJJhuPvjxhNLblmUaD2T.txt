Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. Today. We are joined. Once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very special episode. Episode. I like these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological chronological career of the competitor or the coach that we interview in this case. Case. We interviewed. And since it was the second time we had him on we'd we'd already covered his career. And so I got to talk about a lot of things things on this show and I had I'd get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on on a lot of different things and we kind of went through a couple topics topics one was his little brother Greg just want his fifth State title High School School in New York. And so we talked a little bit about that and then Greg Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
