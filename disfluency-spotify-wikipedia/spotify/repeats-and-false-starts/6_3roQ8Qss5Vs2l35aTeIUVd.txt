Sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, there's many many many many many many many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the kids do would be be be be be be be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in this household and and and and and and and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch not walk walk walk walk walk walk walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance dance dance dance dance dance dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's that's that's that's that's that's that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo overdo overdo overdo overdo overdo overdo it. I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
