Hey before hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about the the mentorship group as Leaders. We know we know that we need the wisdom of a mentor mentor to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often often finding that person. We trust we trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if if we do find them then on the other side of the world or or is too expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring mentoring people now for over 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this this year. I've been I've been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I I can help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship mentorship group here. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. Sessions. You can ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world world for a fraction of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
