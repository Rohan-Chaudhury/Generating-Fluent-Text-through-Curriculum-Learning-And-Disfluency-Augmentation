It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small small small small small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. If If If If If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose levels are are are are are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is the movement movement movement movement movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. The The the The the The the The the The The The The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream bloodstream bloodstream bloodstream bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these these these these these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble insoluble insoluble insoluble insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a a a a a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
