Welcome to episode 155 of the Marvel Studios News podcast. My name is Sean Sean Gerber joined by Paul Herman. How you doing? Paul? I'm getting over being sick and and just getting over being sick. I'm fine. But just it's weird being sick and and trying to recoup its weird. But I'm headed. I'm headed the right way. I'm I'm headed the right direction. I think I think so, but yeah, thanks for asking. I'm glad glad you're on. On the mend we did a couple patreon exclusive shows over the the weekend or Friday night and you were sounding a little rough. But at least least you know, you stuck it out for our wonderful patrons absolutely over there, which which I know they appreciate so for this episode or actually before I get get started with the episode make sure you're following us on our Instagram at Marvel Studios Studios news. I'm doing a lot of things over there doing daily MCU trivia, some some of you are doing very very well. Good job, good job, but also we gave I put up a post on their a week or so ago offering an opportunity.
