Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to to to leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on on on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days days days to digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what what what we're going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And And And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate reiterate reiterate you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly Incredibly Incredibly talented athletes. I mean I mean I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, example, example, but they're / like fractions of a second. So that so that so that shouldn't make you you you wildly swinging your view of a player but we did learn some things some some some players had much better showing than others. So I so I so I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
