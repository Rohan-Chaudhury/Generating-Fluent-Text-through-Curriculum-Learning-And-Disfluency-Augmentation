Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching coaching coaching coaching coaching newsletter and the topic of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in in in in in life. This is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the the the the the reality is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to to to to to feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not not not not not always going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be be be be be really great and you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And And And And And other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're you're you're you're you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your your your your your life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you want want want want want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for you. You you you you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
