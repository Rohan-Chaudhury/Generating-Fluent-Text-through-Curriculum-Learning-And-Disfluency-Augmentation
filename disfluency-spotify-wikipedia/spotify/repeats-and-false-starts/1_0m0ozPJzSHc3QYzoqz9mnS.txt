The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier and it's much easier. Easier. It is it is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far the easiest way way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. In one place so so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on your phone right right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the creation tools. Tools. You need you need to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean I mean we've recorded.
