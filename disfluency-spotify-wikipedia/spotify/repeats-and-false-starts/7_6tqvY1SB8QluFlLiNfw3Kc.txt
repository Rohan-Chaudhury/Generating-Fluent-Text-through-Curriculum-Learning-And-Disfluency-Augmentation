Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires fires fires fires fires fires fires fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place place place place place place place place of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place place place place place place place place due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the the the the the the the the tiebreaker because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't care if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you you you you you you you you look at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that that that that that that that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second second second second second second second second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
