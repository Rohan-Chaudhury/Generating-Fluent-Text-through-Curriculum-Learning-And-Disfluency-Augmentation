It It is Thursday, March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little little pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't we didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs Leafs loss in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row row prior The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to to sort of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road Road road Road that we're key games against teams that were at least on par with them Florida Florida a few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver Vancouver who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference.
