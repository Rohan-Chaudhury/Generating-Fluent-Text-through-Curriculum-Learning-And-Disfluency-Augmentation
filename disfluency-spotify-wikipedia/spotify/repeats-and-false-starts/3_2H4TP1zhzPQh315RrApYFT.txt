She's since she's since she's since she's since since since since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a while, while, while, while, but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent the last several years years years years studying herbs. Actually, she actually, she actually, she actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I met her and she she she she has spent all these years doing that.
