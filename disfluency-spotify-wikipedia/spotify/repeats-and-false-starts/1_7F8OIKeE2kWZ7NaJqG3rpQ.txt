He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and and other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to to reinvent religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend friend while listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I I highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the speakers in in my car. My current my current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead of of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's only only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
