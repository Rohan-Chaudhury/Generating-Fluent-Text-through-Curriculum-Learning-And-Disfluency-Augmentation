What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going we're going we're going we're going we're going we're going we're going we're going to talk about about about about about about about about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S S S S S S S S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about about about about about about about about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the the the the the the the the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were we were we were we were we were we were we were we were just recording recording recording recording recording recording recording recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. 3 3 3 3 3 3 3. It's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new new new new new new new new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then then then then then then then then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake brake brake brake brake brake brake brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some some some some some some some some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I and I and I and I and I and I and I and I was just thinking like like like like like like like like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand Brand Brand Brand Brand Brand Brand Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package package package package package package package package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
