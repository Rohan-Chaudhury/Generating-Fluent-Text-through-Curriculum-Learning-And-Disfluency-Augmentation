But before we we we we we we we we do, I thought it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry Terry Terry Terry Terry Terry Terry Terry how you doing. I am doing fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours just just just just just just just just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it where where where where where where where where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours wasn't quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian Australian Australian Australian Australian Australian Australian Australian summer time and North American summer time do not occur at the same same same same same same same same time. So I'm like, let's figure out a time to record what will be be be be be be be be good and I'm like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards backwards backwards backwards backwards backwards backwards backwards and like I can wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody.
