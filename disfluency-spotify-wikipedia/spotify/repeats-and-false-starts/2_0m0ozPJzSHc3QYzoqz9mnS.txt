And And And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we we we would have had when we first started out this would have been way way way way easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, know, know, so anchor is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you you you everything you need. In one in one in one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools Tools Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit edit edit it on your phone right there free.
