It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you know, know, know, know, know, know, know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. Conversation conversation conversation conversation conversation conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to to to to to to to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's like like like like like like like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know was a a a a a a a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because we just just just just just just just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make you you you you you you you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that it's it's it's it's it's it's it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
