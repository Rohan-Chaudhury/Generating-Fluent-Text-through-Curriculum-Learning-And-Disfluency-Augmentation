And all it did did did did did did did for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me of all all all all all all all time, which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, first of all all all all all all all when you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got to go. Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, man, I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's my my my my my my my favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on on on on on on on it. Is that Love's in Need of Love today? We need to give the the the the the the the love back to ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted wanted wanted wanted wanted wanted wanted to get you to consider that you can apply this to lots of things things things things things things things in your life and fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
