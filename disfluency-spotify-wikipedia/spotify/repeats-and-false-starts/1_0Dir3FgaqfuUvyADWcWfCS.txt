Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So So for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was it was one one of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
