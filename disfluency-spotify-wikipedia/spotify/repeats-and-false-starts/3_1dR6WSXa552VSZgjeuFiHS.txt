Hi, this hi, this hi, this hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about about about about talking to you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Assets assets assets. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about about about about how much money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your your your your personal life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get get get get so many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this this this this is our time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. Questions questions questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 years. Years years years. We talked about marriage. He's actually he's actually he's actually he's actually more vocal about it than I am but but but but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their families. Families families families. I promise I promise I promise I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
