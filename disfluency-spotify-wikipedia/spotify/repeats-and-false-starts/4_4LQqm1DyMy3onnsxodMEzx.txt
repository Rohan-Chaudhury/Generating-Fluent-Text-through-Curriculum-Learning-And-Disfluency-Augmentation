What What What What What is this caused by this is caused by an increased number of cgg trinucleotide repeats repeats repeats repeats repeats on the fragile X.

Fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1. So remember these cgg trinucleotide repeats fragile X mental retardation fmr1 gene on the long arm. Leading to leading to leading to leading to leading to hypermethylation and.
