Hey guys, hey guys, it's Jeff hammer or your Law of Attraction coach with the dominating dominating Edge today. We'll speak about the Benjamin Franklin technique. So stick so stick around when I was a a kid. Kid growing kid growing up in Minnesota. Oh, maybe I was about 13 or 14 years old. Old. I was having a tough time making a decision on whether I wanted to to accept an offer to play in the school's jazz band. I was a trumpet trumpet player. Already playing with the concert band and Orchestra So although I was flattered by the invitation. I knew.
