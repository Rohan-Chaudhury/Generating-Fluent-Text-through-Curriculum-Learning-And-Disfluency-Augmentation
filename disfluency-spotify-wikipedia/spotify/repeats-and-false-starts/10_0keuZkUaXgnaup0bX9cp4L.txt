Act but act but act but act but act but act but act but act but act but act but act but it's basically the idea of ableism ableism ableism ableism ableism ableism ableism ableism ableism ableism ableism and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as opposed to those those those those those those those those those those those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way.
