Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you you you you you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that Madison Pruitt with with with with with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description and and and and and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be be be be be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next next next next next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner winner winner winner winner of this season, right? Is there is there is there is there is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming filming filming filming filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless unless unless unless unless y'all have other theories. Let me let me let me let me let me know your thoughts down in the comments comments comments comments comments below. That's all that's all that's all that's all that's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if but if but if but if but if you're you're you're you're you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. Today today today today.
