So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I I I I I I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I I I I I I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it can can can can can can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, away, away, away, away, away, which I know better than than than than than than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop and it's it's it's it's it's it's one of my weaknesses. Well so well so well so well so well so well so my coach said something to me so so so so so so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
