And today I'm interviewing interviewing interviewing interviewing interviewing interviewing interviewing had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is is is is is is is he do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff you do? Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything everything everything everything everything everything everything else had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn learn learn learn learn learn learn especially when doing gcses and a-levels.
