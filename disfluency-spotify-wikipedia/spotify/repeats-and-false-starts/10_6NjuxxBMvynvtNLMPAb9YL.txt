Salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release for for for for for for for for for for for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to the the the the the the the the the the the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower shower shower shower shower shower shower shower shower shower shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I I I I I I I I I I I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not not not not not not not not not not not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just filled music music music music music music music music music music music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all these musical musical musical musical musical musical musical musical musical musical musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to be or or or or or or or or or or or when it will be but it just happens after you listen to it for a a a a a a a a a a a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography when those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. Music music music music music music music music music music. So those little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
