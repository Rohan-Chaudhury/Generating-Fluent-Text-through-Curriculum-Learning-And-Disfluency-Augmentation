I'm ready I'm ready to drink some wine. Okay? All right. Welcome to pardon my snark the the podcast where a girlfriend. Gossips to her boyfriend about Caroline Calloway, and for some reason he he listens. I'm Shay I'm Ryan. And and today we are shifting a little bit. Bit. We are going to obviously still be talking about Caroline, but we're going to to shift a little bit into some Taylor Lorenz snark and for that we have a special guest today.
