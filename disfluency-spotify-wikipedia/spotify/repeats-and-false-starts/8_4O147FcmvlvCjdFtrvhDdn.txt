Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune out out out out out out out out out if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I I I I I I I I I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew Link in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that that that that that that that that that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley Crawley Crawley Crawley Crawley Crawley Crawley Crawley Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Straight straight straight straight straight straight straight straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she she she she she she she she she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been been been been been been been been been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless unless unless unless unless unless unless unless unless y'all have other theories.
