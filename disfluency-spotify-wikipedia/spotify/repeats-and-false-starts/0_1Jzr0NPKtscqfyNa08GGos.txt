This week's episode is all about working away from the home Mamas and the stay-at-home moms. And we just kind of want to share our experiences since I stay at home with my kids Sam works out of the home and just kind of bring a little bit of insight and show you that there are really great things. There are some really messy Parts about each roll. So go and do whatever you do when you listen to podcasts whether you're cleaning your kitchen or throw your kiddos in their stroller and go for a walk and let's chat. Hey mamas, I'm Sam and I'm Taryn and together. We're the messy Mama's we've created the messy Mama pod because we've both experienced the messiness that motherhood brings. We're completely unfiltered and unapologetically ourselves as we chat about all things motherhood. Once a month were going to be spotlighting one of you mama's so that you can share your story advocate for your babies and connect with the other messy moms in our community dry. Shampoo is our best friend in this shirt may or may not be Queen. Our lives are completely chaotic.
