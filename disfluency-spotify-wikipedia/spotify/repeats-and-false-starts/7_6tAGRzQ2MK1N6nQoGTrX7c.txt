So the ideal position for this meditation is to to to to to to to to be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You You You You You You You You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you you you you you you you you want to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if if if if if if if if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet feet feet feet feet feet feet feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either you're sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. Navel navel navel navel navel navel navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
