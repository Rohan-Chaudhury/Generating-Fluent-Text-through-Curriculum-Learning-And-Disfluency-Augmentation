Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are so so so so so so nasty. They are they are they are they are they are they are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the Metropolitan. Well, Well, Well, Well, Well, Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the tiebreak, which is is is is is is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would make the the the the the the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if technically they're not not not not not not in first. All I care about is when you look at the points it is tied. Tied tied tied tied tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the situation we we we we we we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the so the so the so the so the so the Flyers Flyers Flyers Flyers Flyers Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
