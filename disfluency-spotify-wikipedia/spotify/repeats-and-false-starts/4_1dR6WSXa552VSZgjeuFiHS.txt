But not but not but not but not but not just money wealth means wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about about about about about how much money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in in in in in your personal life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. Stuff stuff stuff stuff. I get I get I get I get I get so many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Helping helping helping helping helping helping helping helping helping helping helping helping. Some VIP. So this is our time for us to be together and for me me me me me to answer your questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a a a a a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about about about about about it than I am but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and and and and and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
