Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release for for for for for for for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography and and and and and and and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just I just I just I just I just I just I just listened to to to to to to to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the the the the the the the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not not not not not not not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's It's It's It's It's It's It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand stand stand stand stand stand stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going going going going going going going to be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen to it it it it it it it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug in and and and and and and and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach teach teach teach teach teach teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son son son son son son son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
