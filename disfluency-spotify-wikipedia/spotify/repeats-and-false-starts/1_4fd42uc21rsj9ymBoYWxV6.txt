Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this and this is my video coaching newsletter and then then topic of today's newsletter is going to be what to do when your girl goes goes psycho. So obviously I've got two good friends of mine. Dr. Dominic Deanna who who you have met and then Ashley, Miss Ashley. Who is with us the other other day and we got a bunch of questions if people wanted to ask because because obviously the video that we posted the other day people had some questions because there there it's like talked about in my first book 3% man that you can actually end end a relationship healthfully not full of anger and resentment and hate and cursing cursing each other out and Keen each other's cars and doing shitty things and saying shitty things you guys or it I got yes you can.
