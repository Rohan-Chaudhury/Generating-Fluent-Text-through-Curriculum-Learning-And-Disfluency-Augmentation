Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. Surprised surprised. I guess there was a time. I think I think I think it was my 18th birthday that that that that I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out out out a little bit the day up. But for the most part very few things things things surprise me. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Must must. Have felt here towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John John John starting in verse 19 following it says this and the evening of that first first first day of the week when the disciples were together with the doors locked for for for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with with with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
