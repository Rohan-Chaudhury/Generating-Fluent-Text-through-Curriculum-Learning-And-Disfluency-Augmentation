Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune out if if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production production crew Link in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out on this channel and and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pm. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
