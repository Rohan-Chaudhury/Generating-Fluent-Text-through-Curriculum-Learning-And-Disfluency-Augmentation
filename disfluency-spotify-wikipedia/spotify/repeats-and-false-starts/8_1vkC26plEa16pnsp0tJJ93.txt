The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest some some some some some some some some some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I know know know know know know know know know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're / / / / / / / / / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view of of of of of of of of of a player but we did learn some things some players had much better showing showing showing showing showing showing showing showing showing than others.
