I made I made I made I made I made I made I made I made a a a a a a a a mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she she she she she she she she put out and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it it it it it it it it that I said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but but but but but but but but You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
