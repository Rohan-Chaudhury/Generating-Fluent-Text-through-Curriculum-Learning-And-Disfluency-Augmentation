That's right. I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back with another episode of med school radio and we're looking at at at at at at at at at at at some more educational objectives. Let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get let's get right to it starting with fragile X syndrome. What What What What What What What What What What What is this caused by this is caused by an increased number of cgg trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide repeats on the fragile X. Mental retardation Gene and that is fmr1 on the the the the the the the the the the the long arm of the X chromosome and this leads to hyper methylation and inactivation of of of of of of of of of of of fmr1. So remember these cgg trinucleotide repeats fragile X mental retardation fmr1 gene on the long arm. Leading to hypermethylation and.
