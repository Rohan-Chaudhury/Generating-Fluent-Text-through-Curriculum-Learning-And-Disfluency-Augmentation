My he my he my he my he my he my he thought I'll bet that person who lost lost lost lost lost lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Sight sight sight sight sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much much much much much much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was was was was was was obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around around around around around around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came came came came came came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the finally the finally the finally the finally the finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
