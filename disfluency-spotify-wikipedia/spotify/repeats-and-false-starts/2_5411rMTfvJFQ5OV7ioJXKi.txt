Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on on on the John Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty twenty twenty seven cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the the the United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 cases confirmed confirmed confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we haven't had any any any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
