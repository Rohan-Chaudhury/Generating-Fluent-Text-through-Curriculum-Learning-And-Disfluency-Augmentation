So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I am am am am joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream dream dream dream speakers in another episode of tomes of magic. But before but before but before but before we do, I thought thought thought thought it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. Doing doing doing. I am doing fine. I was I was I was I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk talk talk talk about the woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half half half half hours just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back back back back where they take it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about about about about that for two hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was was was was I forgot that Australian summer time and North American summer time do not not not not occur at the same time. So I'm like, let's figure out a time time time time to record what will be good and I'm like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds sounds sounds sounds good and I work backwards and like I can wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and but and but and but and then only later did I find out that.
