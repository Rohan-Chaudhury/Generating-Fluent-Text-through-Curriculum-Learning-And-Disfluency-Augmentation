Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are so so nasty. They are they are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the metropolitan. Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care care if technically they're not in first. All I all I care about is when you look at at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
