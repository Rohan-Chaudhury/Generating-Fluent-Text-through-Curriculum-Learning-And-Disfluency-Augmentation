I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso Caso Caso Caso Caso Caso Caso Caso Caso back where they take it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about about about about about about about about about that for two hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was I I I I I I I I I forgot that Australian summer time and North American summer time do not occur at the the the the the the the the the same time.
