Make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I I I I I I I was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in in in in in in in front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. Again again again again again again. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use use use use use use use the small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the the the the the the the lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than than than than than than than traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a a a a a a a great shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could could could could could could could see movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
