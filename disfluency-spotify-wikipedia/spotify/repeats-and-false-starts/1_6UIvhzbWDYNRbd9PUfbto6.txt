Welcome to the special edition of between two Blue Devils. It's parent-teacher conferences here at at Tommy's high school. So I thought maybe I would go around and do something something special a little bit different going to go around and ask random teachers if they they want to answer a question that my students have written. I'm going to pull pull a question out of the grab bag. It's going to IAM impromptu, they're going going to answer it and we're going to get some interesting answers. I'm sure in the the meantime, I want to let you know that tomorrow. We have another official guest and and I cannot wait to interview our next guest here on between two Blue Devils. This This individual is awesome. And the story that they're going to share with you you is unbelievable. So you so you want to make sure you tune in this weekend. Weekend.
