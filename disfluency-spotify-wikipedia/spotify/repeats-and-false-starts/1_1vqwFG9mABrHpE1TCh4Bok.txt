Hello, you lovely bunch and welcome back to yes, another episode of of the vitalife show me Tori and Me Myself and Irene. I have nobody on on this podcast and there's a good reason for it. I also just want to to say if the sound quality sound slightly different. I do apologize. I haven't I haven't got my my headphones and that is because I am currently in the middle of moving so I have have packed my whole life up not thinking that I needed me. Fines and I'm in in the middle of a hotel because I also started a new job last week. Week. And yeah, it's all decided to come at once. But the but the reason I actually chose chose to do this podcast and do this by myself is because it's something that I I want to talk to you about just from my own personal experience for once once to a perfectly honest, obviously with being mental health months and the last couple of episodes to kind of touching on Mental Health.
