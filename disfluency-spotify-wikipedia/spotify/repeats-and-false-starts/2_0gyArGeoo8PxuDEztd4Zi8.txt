Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on vale. Vale Vale. I was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder song song song as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And all it did did did for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me of of of all time, which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, first of all all all when you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got to go. Um, Um, Um, man, I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's my favorite favorite favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on on on it. Is that Love's in Need of Love today? We need to give the love back back back to ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted to to to get you to consider that you can apply this to lots of things things things in your life and fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put so put so put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
