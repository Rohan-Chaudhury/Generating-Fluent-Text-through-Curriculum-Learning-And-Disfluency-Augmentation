Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss I miss you guys. Hope Hope you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode episode starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this podcast podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know catch catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded the past few few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme of this this podcast should be. So if so if you know notice a lot of the things things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So with so with with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. Up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically so basically basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
