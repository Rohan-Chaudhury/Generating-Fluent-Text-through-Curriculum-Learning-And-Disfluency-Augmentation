So is he do you you you you you you you you you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had had had had had had had had had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill.
