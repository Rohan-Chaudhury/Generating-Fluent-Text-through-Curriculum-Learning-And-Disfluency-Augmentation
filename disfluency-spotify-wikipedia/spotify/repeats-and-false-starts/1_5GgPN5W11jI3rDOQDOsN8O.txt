Hello, beautiful people and welcome to waking youth. My name my name is got a a lotta gibberish. I'll be your host and I have to say I'm extremely happy happy to be here with you today. And in and in this episode, I'll just be introducing waking waking youth. How did I come up with this idea? And what waking youth is is all about so over the summer I was listening to a lot of podcasts and I I was thinking that I really wanted to work and focus on my creativity and and when I started the semester I am Third-year communication student in Spain. I was also also looking for an initiative and I was feeling very stressed and very very anxious and I realized that a lot of my friends were also feeling feeling like this because we're obviously we're very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and.
