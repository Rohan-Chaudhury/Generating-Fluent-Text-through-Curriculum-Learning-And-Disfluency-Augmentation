I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of of of of of this podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. Podcast podcast podcast podcast. I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then but then but then but then but then as as as as as I recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out out out out out what the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a a a a a lot of the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental mental mental mental mental health growing up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young young young young young adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing growing growing growing growing up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So So So So So basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically basically basically basically basically having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
