At some at some at some at some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a a a a Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six six six six feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on on on on the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a a a a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who lost lost lost lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Sight sight sight. Around the around the around the around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much much much much to his surprise. Here comes here comes here comes here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was this was this was this was obviously obviously obviously obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated it floated it floated it floated Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a a a a while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the finally the finally the finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
