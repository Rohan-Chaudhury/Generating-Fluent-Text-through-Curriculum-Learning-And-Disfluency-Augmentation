You can learn more about on my free training over at Dropship webinar.com. I'll post post post a link to that in the the description by the way Dropship webinar.com, but but but once you know all that stuff and you kind of understand how how how to build the business then the question is, well, what do you actually have to to to get done before you make that website on Shopify before you contact your first first first supplier before you get your first sale?
