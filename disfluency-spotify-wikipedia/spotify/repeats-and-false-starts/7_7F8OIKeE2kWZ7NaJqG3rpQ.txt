He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other religions religions religions religions religions religions religions religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to reinvent religion for for for for for for for for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while listening to to to to to to to to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in in in in in in in in particular and blew out one of the speakers in my car. My current current current current current current current current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead of Music I've had to to to to to to to to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's only coming out of one one one one one one one one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
