It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, difference, but You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set set set set set set set set set set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
