Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is is is is is is is the fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first first first first first first first place of the Metropolitan. Well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically I understand the Caps are still in in in in in in in first place due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it is it is it is it is it is it is it it it it it it it the tiebreaker because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't don't don't don't don't don't don't care if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you you you you you you you look at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the the the the the the the fact that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so so so so so so so happy. So the so the so the so the so the so the so the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half half half half half half half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
