together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus after after after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets up and he he he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be with the father in in in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the father in prayer, he he he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him and he says to him we've been been been looking for you and Jesus says while I needed to be with the father but but but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like like like us to unpack. It is it is it is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins begins begins it by being with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking by taking by taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
