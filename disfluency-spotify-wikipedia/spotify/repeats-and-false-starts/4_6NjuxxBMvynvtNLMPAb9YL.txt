Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when but when but when but when but when when I get a a a a a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget I forget I forget I forget I forget the the the the the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to the the the the the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower when when when when when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I I I I I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not even even even even even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just filled music and and and and and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks landmarks landmarks landmarks landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to be or or or or or when it will be but it just happens after you listen to it for for for for for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug in and and and and and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach your already naturally naturally naturally naturally naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or little hit hit hit hit hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
