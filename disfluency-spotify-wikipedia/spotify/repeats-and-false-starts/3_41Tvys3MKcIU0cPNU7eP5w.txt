Tom Brady greatest of all all all all time Now if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you that that that that he's staying put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying put put put put it just doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody that has has has has been in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one team just just just just doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense to me.
