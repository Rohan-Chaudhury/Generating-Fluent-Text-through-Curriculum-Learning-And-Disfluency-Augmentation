Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really appreciate appreciate appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this this this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we don't don't don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about it more and and and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. We see in in in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with with with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain mountain mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
