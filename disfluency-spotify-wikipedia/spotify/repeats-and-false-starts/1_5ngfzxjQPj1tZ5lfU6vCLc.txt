Let me tell you why you're here. You're here you're here because you know something. What you what you you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire entire life. That there's something wrong with this world. You don't you don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you crazy.
