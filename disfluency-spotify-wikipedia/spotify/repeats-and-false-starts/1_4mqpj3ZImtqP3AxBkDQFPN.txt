Hey, this hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a a regular Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I I have had some shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to to share of one of which is the fact that I have literally not had a a job for the past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like a a gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my bank account. Account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for a few reasons. Reasons. One of one of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
