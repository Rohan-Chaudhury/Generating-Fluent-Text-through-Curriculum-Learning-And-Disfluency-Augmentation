So I hope you are bear with the bad editing editing in places. I've done my best to fix stuff and re-recorded sections sections that were terrible. Anyway, let's get on with the show in this show. I cover cover recent news and questions that I've been asked by the community. I then spend spend the rest of the show focus on a conversation about maniples the basic building building blocks of the game. I was intending to spend some time discussing how to use them them as narrative devices, but following some feedback and realizing have a lot of Basic Basic Ground to cover I'll be focusing on the man of courses primarily from gaming gaming perspective. This is a longer episode than I initially planned and you'll probably notice a a slight change in Styles throughout the main section of the shug. This week work work was a lot busier than I was expecting and much for my normal recording time was taken by.
