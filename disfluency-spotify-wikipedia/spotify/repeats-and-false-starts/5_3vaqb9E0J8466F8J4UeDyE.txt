Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune out if if if if if if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew crew crew crew crew crew Link in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that that that that that that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that well that well that well that well that well that theory is officially dead because because because because because because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Straight straight straight straight straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette Bachelorette Bachelorette Bachelorette Bachelorette Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is Is Is Is Is Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of of of of of of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know know know know know know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on on on on on on Bachelor News Daily. But if but if but if but if but if but if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a a a a a a deep dive on her earlier today.
