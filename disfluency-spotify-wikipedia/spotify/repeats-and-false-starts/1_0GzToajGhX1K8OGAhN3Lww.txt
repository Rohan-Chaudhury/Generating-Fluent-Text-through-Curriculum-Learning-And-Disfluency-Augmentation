Welcome to the first ever episode of version final a podcast about where ideas come come from. I'm Ben Pereira and I'm a strategist at cnx. The creative agency accounting nest. Nest. Our aim is to talk to creative people in advertising media publishing technology education and and more the ideation process can be a little bit of a black box to those of us us who aren't designated creatives in organizations. We hope we hope these conversations can shed some light light on that as work becomes more D industrialized and more service-based more and more of us us are expected to be creative as part of our jobs. Our hope our hope is that that by talking to people who work daily with incorporate constraints and still managed to be be consistently creative the rest of us can learn how to tap into our own creative sides the the idea for doing a podcast about ideas came from watching how Conde Nast magazine Brands Brands operate cnx and Conde Nast magazine Brands create content for different purposes, but we work pretty.
