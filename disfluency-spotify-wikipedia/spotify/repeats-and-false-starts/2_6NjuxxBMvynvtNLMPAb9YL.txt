Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release release release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget forget forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I I I just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when when when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training training training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as as as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's It's It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out out out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to to to be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen listen listen to it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug plug plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach teach teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or little little little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
