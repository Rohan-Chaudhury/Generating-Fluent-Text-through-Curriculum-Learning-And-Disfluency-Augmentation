Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really appreciate your your your your your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this way by by by by by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we don't don't don't don't don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about it more more more more more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything everything everything everything everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is is is is is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led led led led led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he was was was was was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
