Just talking just talking just talking just talking just talking just talking about random stuff, you know know know know know know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded the the the the the the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme of of of of of of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the things things things things things things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and and and and and and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult.
