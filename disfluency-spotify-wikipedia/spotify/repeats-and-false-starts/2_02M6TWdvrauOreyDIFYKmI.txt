Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the the the weekly weekly podcast and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as as as so far and want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made made made a mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she she she put out and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it it it that I said be nice. It's not it's not it's not a big mistake. It's not a a a big difference, but You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to to to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
