Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be be your host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to to renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse is taken taken from John 7 verse 37. And it and it says on the last and greatest day day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who is is thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation to come come to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is it is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
