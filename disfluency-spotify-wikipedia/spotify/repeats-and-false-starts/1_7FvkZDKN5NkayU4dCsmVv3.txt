You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a I'm a colorist for for film television and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading grading sweet to work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of of mine for an hour a day or weeks on end depending on the project project those clients might be directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now now our work. On the on the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting interesting things. Sometimes it's color but not necessarily and that is what the color color couch is all about. It's a glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast podcast will talk about color from time to time, but it's really about what brought brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
