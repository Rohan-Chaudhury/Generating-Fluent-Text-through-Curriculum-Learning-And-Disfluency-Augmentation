Thank you to everybody who listened to the last episode episode and welcome to anybody who is a new listener here. So on this episode, I'm I'm going to be doing something a little bit different I am going so I'm I'm trying to put together this like algorithm. And so I just wanted to kind kind of film and put together. Kind of kind of making it I guess is the best best way to put it I mean so I've been looking into like I've talked about about in the past I talked about in the last episode that I really am a big fan fan of the Bowman Chrome rookie cards. So not so not the Bowman Prospect cards the ones with with the RC logo. So I was putting together some statistics with the PSA Pop reports and and then the pricing of those specific cards, so Here's basically what I got, so so like I was looking at like players basically I use trout as a baseline, but I think something that's when I originally made this.
