Yo, yo, yo, what's up everyone? I guess I'll kick off this podcast addressing probably the the biggest talk in sports right now. Tom Brady greatest of all time Now if you you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you that he's staying put put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying put it just doesn't doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody that has been in the NFL NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one team just doesn't make make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense to me. So it doesn't doesn't make sense to me for this man the go out and play for another another team at 43 years old after spending his entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just doesn't make sense for.
