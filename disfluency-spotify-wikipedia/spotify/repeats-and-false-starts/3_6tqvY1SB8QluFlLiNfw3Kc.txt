Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the the the the fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first first first first place of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are are are are still in first place due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me me me me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would make the most sense, but but but but of course not listen, I don't care if technically they're not in first. All All All All I care about is when you look at the points it is tied. This very this very this very this very very very very moment and just the fact that that is the situation we are discussing right right right right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to to to to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
