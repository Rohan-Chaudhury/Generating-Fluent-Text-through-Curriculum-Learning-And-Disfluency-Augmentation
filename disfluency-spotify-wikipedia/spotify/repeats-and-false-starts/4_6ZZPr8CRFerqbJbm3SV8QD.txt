Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with moaning with moaning with moaning with moaning with you within you grunting as we we we we we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You You You You You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I and I and I and I and I calm and and and and and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making making making making making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath Breath Breath Breath Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make you make you make you make you make me high higher than than than than than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
