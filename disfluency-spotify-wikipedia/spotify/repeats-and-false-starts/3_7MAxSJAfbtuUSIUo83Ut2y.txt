As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and and and and a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was a a a a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the roof. We had we had we had we had had had had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably a fire fire fire fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number one problem problem problem problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there were Current objects of of of of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure what is safe for the the the the radio. So I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm going to kind of curve that but also objects objects objects objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the the the the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these these these these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
