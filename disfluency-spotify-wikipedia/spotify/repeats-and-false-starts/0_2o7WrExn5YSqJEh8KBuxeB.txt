Hello everyone and welcome to astral ashes. It is pi C season, and I'm Lisa Marie and I'm Andy talarico. Welcome to astral ashes. We are going to be serenading you with a poem to start. So Andy take it away. I'm going to be reading a poem by one of the Lisa and my favorite poets Christina Rossetti and we thought the dreamy quality of this and the sort of fantasy vs. Reality aspect really spoke to pies. Season so this is called I dream of you to wake by Christina Rossetti. I dream of you to wake would that I might dream of you and not wake but Slumber on nor fine with dreams. The dear companion gone as summer ended summer birds take flight and happy dreams. I hold you full and night I blush again who waking look so one brighter than sunniest day that ever shown and happy dreams. Your.
