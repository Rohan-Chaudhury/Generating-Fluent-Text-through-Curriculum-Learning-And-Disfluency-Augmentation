Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining explaining explaining explaining explaining explaining explaining explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine masculine masculine masculine masculine masculine masculine masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an an an an an an an an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny or or or or or or or or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of what what what what what what what what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is ridiculously ridiculously ridiculously ridiculously ridiculously ridiculously ridiculously ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to become a man of of of of of of of of value so that way other men or other people in general can lean on on on on on on on on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If you you you you you you you you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do do do do do do do do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little bit to explain so so so so so so so so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
