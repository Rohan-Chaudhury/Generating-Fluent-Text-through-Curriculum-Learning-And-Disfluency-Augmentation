Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you you you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported reported reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in in in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie Maddie Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because because because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Straight straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she she she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other other other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I I I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts thoughts thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News News News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep deep deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out on this channel and make sure sure sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
