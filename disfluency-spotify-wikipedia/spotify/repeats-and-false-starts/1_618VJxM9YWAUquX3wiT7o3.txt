Keep it up permanently. Let me tell you something. You already know the the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and and I don't care how tough you are. It will it will beat you to your knees and and keep you there permanently. If you let it you me or nobody is is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you hit it's it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Well, if you you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you you wanna be because of him or her or anybody cowards do that. And that ain't ain't you you better than that. It's about how hard you can get hit hit and keep moving forward. Yo. Yo yo, yo yo, it's your boy Evan. Those were little bit of words from Rocky.
