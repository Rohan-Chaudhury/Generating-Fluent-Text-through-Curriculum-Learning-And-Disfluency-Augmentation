Just got to get up and tell the devil who you are. You gotta tell that that devil who you are today. I woke up and I told the devil devil who I am in Christ. I am I am complete in him who is the head of of all principality and power. I am alive in Christ. I am free free from the law of sin and death. I am I am far from oppression and the the enemy cannot come near me. I am born of God and the evil one one cannot touch me. I Am Without Blame before him in love. Love I love I I am in right standing with the father. I have the mind of christ. Christ. I have the peace of God that surpasses all understanding greater is he that is is in me than he that is in the world. I have received the power of the the Holy Spirit. I have put up the old and put on the new I I have been given and it's been given to me. I have no lack lack for my God shall supply all my needs. According to his riches. I have been called out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light of the Gospel.
