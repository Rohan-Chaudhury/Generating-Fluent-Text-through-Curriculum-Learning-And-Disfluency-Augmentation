Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining explaining explaining explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine masculine masculine masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an important important important important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny Destiny Destiny Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control control control control of what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. Success success success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not and not and not and not only that if you want to to to to become a man of value so that way other men or other people in general can can can can lean on you. You're going you're going you're going you're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. Deal deal deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot cannot cannot cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very very very very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little bit to explain so so so so grab a pen grab a paper. If you if you if you if you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
