We've got a couple of a couple cool things to talk about including a an interesting scoop on Mandalorian season 2, but first we gotta check in with Charles and see what's going on over in the Philippines. I'm not much is going on still saying The coronavirus care still happening, but we're still standing here. So let's fucking do this. I want to hear scoop. Yeah. So this is this is an interesting one and something I've been working on for a while. Obviously you guys that have been listening know that Charles and I watched the Mandalorian for season Mandalorian. We both liked it a lot but we aren't usually in the business of getting Star Wars scoops of any kind and so before I share it with you. I want to make sure we know that this.
