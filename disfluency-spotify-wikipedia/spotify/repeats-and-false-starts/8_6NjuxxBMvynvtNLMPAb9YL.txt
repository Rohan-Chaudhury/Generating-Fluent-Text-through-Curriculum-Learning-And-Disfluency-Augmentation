Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a a a a a a a a a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget I forget I forget I forget I forget I forget I forget I forget I forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as as as as as as as as as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the the the the the the the the the work out. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what what what what what what what what what that's going to be or when it will be but it just happens after after after after after after after after after you listen to it for a while and then when you actually then go right right right right right right right right right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and and and and and and and and and you teach your already naturally in the music. So those so those so those so those so those so those so those so those so those little moments that your son son son son son son son son son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
