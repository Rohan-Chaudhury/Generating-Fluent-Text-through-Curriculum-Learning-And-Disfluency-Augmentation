Hello friends, thank you for listening in today the theme of this first episode in in a series is one that I consider really foundational as you know, my goal goal with pondering purple is to help missionaries kids and the people who love them to better better understand the complexities that drive us the gifts and the challenges the joys and and the frustrations of growing up in a multicultural Ministry focused and complicated environment. Ain't there there was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that came from growing up up between worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and the hard hard then I went to a school for missionaries kids in Germany when I was in in ninth grade, and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't hadn't quite been able to put a finger on we're not just in me me my friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where that's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
