Hello and welcome to come want to start off the show by giving a fond farewell at least in the context of a presidential candidate to Amy Klobuchar. Amy Klobuchar has in recent weeks and months on some level endeared herself to me. I mean kind of a Madwoman if you're not familiar with her, she wasn't particularly viable as a candidate it seems She got a shot. Someone say surprise. Someone say shocking some would say rat fucking endorsement from The New York Times along.
