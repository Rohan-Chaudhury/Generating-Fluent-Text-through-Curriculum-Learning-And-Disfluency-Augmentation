What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the the the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid plasmid plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about about about from a financial perspective. So going so going so going to nerd out on this shout out to the the the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were we were we were just just just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. 3 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking looking looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you you you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake brake brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten it's gotten it's gotten gotten gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like like like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Performance Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of of of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is is is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
