You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here here here here here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's it's it's it's it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know know know know know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't think it was enough enough enough enough enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways to to to to to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally totally totally totally totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and and and and and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
