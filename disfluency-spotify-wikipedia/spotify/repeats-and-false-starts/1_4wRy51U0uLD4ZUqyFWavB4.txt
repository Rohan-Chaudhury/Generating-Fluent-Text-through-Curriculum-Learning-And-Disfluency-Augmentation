Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I well, I am too but I'm trying trying to pretend I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this podcast podcast episode set up because my microphone I feel like it's only really good for one one person and that I feel like our audio is always a little off off and you guys have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it we're we're probably going to have to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome to yeah, yeah, we said it with me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time tuning in. In. This is a mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice questions that you you emailed to me and Miss thing at gmail.com. And I would say it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
