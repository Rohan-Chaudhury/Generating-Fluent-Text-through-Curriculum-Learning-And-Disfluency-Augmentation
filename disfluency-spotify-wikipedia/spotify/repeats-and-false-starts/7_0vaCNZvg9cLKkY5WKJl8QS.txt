Going back going back going back going back going back going back going back going back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think think think think think think think think that all of the information in part to her story all her tips the the the the the the the the way that she parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost more more more more more more more more like valuable when you know where she came from part 1 is all about her life life life life life life life life as a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her as a a a a a a a a young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
