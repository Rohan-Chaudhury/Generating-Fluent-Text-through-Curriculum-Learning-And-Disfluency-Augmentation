Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about about about the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of of of a mentor to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, yet, yet, too often finding that person. We trust we trust we trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then then then if we do find them then on the other side of the world or or or is too expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been I've been I've been mentoring people now now now for over 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've I've I've I've I've I've I've been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help help help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. Here here. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can can can ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction fraction fraction of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
