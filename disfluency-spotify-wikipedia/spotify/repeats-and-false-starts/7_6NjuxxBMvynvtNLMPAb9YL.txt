Salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get get get get get get get get a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les mills. Mills Mills Mills Mills Mills Mills Mills. I forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. Workout workout workout workout workout workout workout. I just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Time time time time time time time. Like when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when when when when when when when when I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many many many many many many many many times as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the the the the the the the the work out. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what what what what what what what what that's going to be or when it will be but it just happens after after after after after after after after you listen to it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach teach teach teach teach teach teach teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or or or or or or or or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
