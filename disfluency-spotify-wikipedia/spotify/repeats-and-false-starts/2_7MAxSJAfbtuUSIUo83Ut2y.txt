As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and and and a half. What does what does what does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so so so it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the the the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was was was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number number number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there were Current Current Current objects of pleasure. I guess I guess I guess you could say I'm not too sure what is safe safe safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but also objects to practice practice practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the watch of of of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these these these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
