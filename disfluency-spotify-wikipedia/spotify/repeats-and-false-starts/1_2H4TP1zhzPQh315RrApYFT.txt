I'm going going to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's see see here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to believe that now now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of all of that kind of thing thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. She's since she's since moved away and and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a while, but it was really great to to record this episode. She has spent the last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was was already pretty into it whenever I met her and she has spent all these these years doing that. So she's going to share some of her knowledge of herbs herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have to apologize that I have have not figured out yet, which I need to do before I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
