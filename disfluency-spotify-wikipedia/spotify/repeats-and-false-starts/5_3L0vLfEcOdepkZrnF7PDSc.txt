It was it was it was it was it was it was just a lot of of of of of of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after but I had so much much much much much much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. Smear I smear I smear I smear I smear I smear I I I I I I have errands to run I was linking with people that I see in a a a a a a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New Orleans and and and and and and my mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and it be be be be be be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my house and no no no no no no one's here right now, which is kind of rare.
