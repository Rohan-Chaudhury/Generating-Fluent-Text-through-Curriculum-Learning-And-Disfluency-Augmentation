I've never even been to Oklahoma. I'm pretty sure it's where the wind goes goes whipping down the plains and up until recently that's about what I knew of it. It. But now I know it's also the ancestral home of two warring American factions those those no-good greasers and those rotten sotius. Greetings and welcome to fuckboys of literature. I'm your your host Emily Edwards. What is what is it about this book? That just gets it I I mention it on Twitter and it gets love letters. So with me today is is writer journalist Leslie gray Streeter. How are you today? I am really good. I'm really I'm really really good. Thank you. I am so excited to have you on because you suggested a book that I was embarrassed to say that I had. Never.
