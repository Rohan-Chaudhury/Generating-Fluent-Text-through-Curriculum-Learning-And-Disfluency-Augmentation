We're recording this on Monday morning. Morning morning morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest some some some some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going going going going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I I I I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot cannot cannot cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are these are these are these are Incredibly talented athletes. Athletes athletes athletes. I mean I mean I mean I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just it's just it's just it's just an example, but they're / / / / like fractions of a second. So that so that so that so that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view view view view of a player but we did learn some things some players had much better better better better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
