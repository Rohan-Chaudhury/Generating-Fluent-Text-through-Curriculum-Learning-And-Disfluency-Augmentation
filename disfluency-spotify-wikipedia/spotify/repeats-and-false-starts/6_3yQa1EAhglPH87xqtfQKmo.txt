You're not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not always going to feel like like like like like like like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel feel feel feel feel feel feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and and and and and and and you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's it's it's it's it's it's it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling telling telling telling telling telling telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you you you you you you you want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic unrealistic unrealistic unrealistic unrealistic unrealistic unrealistic for you.
