I made a mistake on on on on on on on on on on on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she put out out out out out out out out out out out and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it that that that that that that that that that that that I said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but You You You You You You You You You You You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it right right right right right right right right right right right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
