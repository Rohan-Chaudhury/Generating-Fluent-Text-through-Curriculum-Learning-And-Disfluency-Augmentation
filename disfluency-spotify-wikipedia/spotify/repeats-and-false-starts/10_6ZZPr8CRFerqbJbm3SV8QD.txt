Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as we we we we we we we we we we we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You come and I I I I I I I I I I I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and you fall to your knees and and and and and and and and and and and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making love my breath is a fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking that you're not forget. Your breath your breath your breath your breath your breath your breath your breath your breath your breath your breath your breath the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're You're You're You're You're You're You're You're You're You're You're breathing keeps me high. You make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
