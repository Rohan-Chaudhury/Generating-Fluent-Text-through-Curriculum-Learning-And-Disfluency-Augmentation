In a world where two people God in a podcast for too early early early early for this but their cat at 6:00 in the morning. If you here they start start start start to do a bomb gasps gasps gasps this are you done? No, let me me me me have my fun. If you hear little sniffling and little like chipmunk noises in the the the the background, that's our kitten Nona if you haven't been following along the latest week week week week or two kitchen. You're so you're so you're so you're so like you come up with the stupidest jokes when when when when we feel like they're they're bad. They're not good. Like they're not funny. Oh my God. No I no I no I no I so we don't even want to marry me. I don't know.
