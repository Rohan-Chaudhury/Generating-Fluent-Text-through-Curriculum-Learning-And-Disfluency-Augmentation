Salute up, salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I I forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the the work out. It's just it's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you you don't know what that's going to be or when it will be but it just just happens after you listen to it for a while and then when you actually actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come together together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
