There There are some nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear hear it. If this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Recommend. Going back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I but I do do think that all of the information in part to her story all her tips the the way that she parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost more more like valuable when you know where she came from part 1 is all all about her life as a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her her as a young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
