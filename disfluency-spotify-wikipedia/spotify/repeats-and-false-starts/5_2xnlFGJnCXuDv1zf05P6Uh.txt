What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the gross gross gross gross gross gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from from from from from from a financial perspective. So going so going so going so going so going so going to nerd out on this shout out to to to to to to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We We We We We We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came came came came came came out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically basically basically basically basically basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which which which which which which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these these these these these these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. Track track track track track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And And And And And And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of of of of of of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort sort sort sort sort sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is is is is is is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
