Make sure make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in in front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. Again. And again, and again, it was so dark in here that I had to use use the small lamp on the table next to me. They really they really need to fix fix the lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other other than traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a a great shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
