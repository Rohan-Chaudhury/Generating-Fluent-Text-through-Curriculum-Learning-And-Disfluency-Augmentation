What's going on everybody? Welcome back to the quickie. This is Luke Luke and I'm going to talk about a Convent not really conversation. Let's talk about a statement statement from Brandi Love about her and her her husband's relationship whether it's an open open relationship with that. I don't know how it will have fun. Alright, Alright, stay tuned. Welcome to the quickie and first before we get into the show, show, if you haven't heard about anchor before downloading it this time, it is the the easiest way to make a podcast and I encourage you to make your own own podcast. It's fun and it's free. It's free to download is free free to be chord you talk. Anyway, you have conversations. Anyway, why not record it it and make money while you're doing it. There are creation tools that allow you to record record and edit your podcast right from your phone or your computer. Anchor will distribute your podcast for you. So I can be heard on Spotify Apple podcast and other.
