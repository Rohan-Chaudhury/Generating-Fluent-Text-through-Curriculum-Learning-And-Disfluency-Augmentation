Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And And And And And And And And And And I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of of of of of of of of of of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath breath breath breath breath breath breath breath breath breath the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make me me me me me me me me me me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
