Welcome to the hottest take my name is Chris Ryan. I am joined by by Jason concepci√≥n Juliet Littman and David Shoemaker and David you have before. I know that that we fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country needs is is a king. Oh my oh my God now listen. Listen, I'm listen, I'm not saying we need a a monarch with absolute power. I'm not saying we need to go to some some like Royal Dutch like diagnostic system. But look but look at England right now how much better would would our political discourse be if we would just elect the king for every like a a decade every 10 years. Donald Trump donald Trump gets to be king. But we have a like like a boring-ass technocrat. Who's They're who's They're as prime minister is actually making the decision, right? right So he's have a guy who's a guy or a gal whose job job is to go to NASCAR races and give speeches and set off. The first fireworks fireworks on the fourth of July. If you want to figure out is what I want a figure, how did.
