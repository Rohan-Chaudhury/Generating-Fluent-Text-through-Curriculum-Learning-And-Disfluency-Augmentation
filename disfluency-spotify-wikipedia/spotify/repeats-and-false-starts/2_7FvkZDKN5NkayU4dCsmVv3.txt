You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and everything everything everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work work work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a day day day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers producers or or or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the on the on the project project project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but not not not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a a a glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from from from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did how did how did I get to this place in.
