Yes. Hi. I am calling this number because I saw it on a bathroom wall. Wall wall wall wall. See if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is going to to to to to hell and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have Adam Breeze Breeze Breeze Breeze Breeze of Raven I with us but before we hop into that, I just wanted wanted wanted wanted wanted to go over I sold myself short on the last episode about my romantic romantic romantic romantic romantic capabilities. I think I came up on the last. Episode saying that I don't don't don't don't don't remember what I got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards out, out, out, out, out, but I personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got him a a a a a heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got got got got got him Star Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
