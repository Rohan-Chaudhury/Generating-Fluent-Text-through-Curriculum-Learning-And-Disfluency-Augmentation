Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may ask that is is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven years old Nate nasty nasty couple of nicknames. He had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Ace Qbert boos. Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I assure you you I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years but but the reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because he he has a propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four four weeks at a time or maybe even a couple days when I get my sad sad boy moments. I'm talking I'm talking six months to a year. This man can disappear at times. Times. He has a lot of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
