Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become become become so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a fitness fitness fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she she she came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the World World World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may may may do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the the the idea of ableism and how the world is set up for people who are are are able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very very very specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really really really interesting conversation. I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate rate rate review And subscribe. Bye.
