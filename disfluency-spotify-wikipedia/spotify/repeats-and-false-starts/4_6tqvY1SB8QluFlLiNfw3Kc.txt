Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are are are are are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the metropolitan. Metropolitan Metropolitan Metropolitan Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the tiebreak, tiebreak, tiebreak, tiebreak, tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it is it is it is it is it the tiebreaker because because because because because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if if if if if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at at at at at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that that that that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the so the so the so the so the the the the the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
