If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show show notes in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and and I opened it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone anyone ever comes to you saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking thinking you kind of have that habit of of of telling us all is is well and your own words. And so okay. So what so what I'm getting at is is are there good angels and bad angels and we want to remind remind you that that there is a stream of well-being which you are allowing or or not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason are standing in a place place where they are not allowing their alignment with that stream of well-being because not being being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so you is so painful from from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
