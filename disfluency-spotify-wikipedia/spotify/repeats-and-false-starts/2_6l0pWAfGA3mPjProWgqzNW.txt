He had he had he had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Fergus Fergus Ace Qbert Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I I I assure you I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years years years but the reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because he has a a a propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four weeks at a time or or or maybe even a couple days when I get my sad boy moments. I'm talking talking talking six months to a year. This man this man this man can disappear at times.
