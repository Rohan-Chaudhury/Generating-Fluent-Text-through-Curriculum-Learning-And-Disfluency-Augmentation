And yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach coach coach coach coach coach coach coach because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall fall fall fall fall fall fall fall into this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, which I know better than to do but I just kind of got caught caught caught caught caught caught caught caught in a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach coach coach coach coach coach coach coach said something to me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has has has has has has has has been so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
