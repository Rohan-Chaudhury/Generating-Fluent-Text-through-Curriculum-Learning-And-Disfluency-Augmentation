This is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality reality reality reality reality reality reality reality reality is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to to to to to to to to to feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going going going going going going going going going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be be be be be be be be be really great and you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other other other other other other other other other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a a a a a a a a a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your life life life life life life life life life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you you you you you you you you you want to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for for for for for for for for for you.
