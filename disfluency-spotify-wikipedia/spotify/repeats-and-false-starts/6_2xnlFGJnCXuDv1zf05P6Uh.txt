What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about about about about about about about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and and and and and and and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from from from from from from from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out out out out out out out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just just just just just just just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the the the the the the the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really really really really really really really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires tires tires tires tires tires tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. Track track track track track track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just just just just just just just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury luxury luxury luxury luxury luxury luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services services services services services services services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track track track track track track track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
