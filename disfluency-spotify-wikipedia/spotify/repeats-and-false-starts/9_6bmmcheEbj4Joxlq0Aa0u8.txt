At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over over over over over over over over over over a Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six six six six six six six six six six feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the the the the the the the the the the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a a a a a a a a a a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who who who who who who who who who who lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to to to to to to to to to to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously very strange. So the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a while. While while while while while while while while while. It came it came it came it came it came it came it came it came it came it came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
