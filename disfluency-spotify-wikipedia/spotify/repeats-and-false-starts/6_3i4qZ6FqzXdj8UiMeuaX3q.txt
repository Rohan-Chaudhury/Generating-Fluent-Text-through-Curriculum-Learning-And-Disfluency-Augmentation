Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have have have have have have have and they did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they got got got got got got got up big early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that lead lead lead lead lead lead lead going into halftime and then by the second half things kind of evened out out out out out out out in South Carolina, they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 and and and and and and and most of the time they were up by like six or something like that but but but but but but but it felt comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but a a a a a a a lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and as much much much much much much much as we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
