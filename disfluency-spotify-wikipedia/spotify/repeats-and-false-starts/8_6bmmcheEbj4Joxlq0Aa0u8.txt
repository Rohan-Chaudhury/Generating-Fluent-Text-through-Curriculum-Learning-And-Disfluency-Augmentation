At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over over over over over over over over over a Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about about about about about about about about about six feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting on the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened happened happened happened happened happened happened happened happened to notice a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet that person who lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had had had had had had had had had floated out of sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching watching watching watching watching watching watching watching watching the river suddenly much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against against against against against against against against against the current. This was obviously very strange. So the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the lad kept his eye on it. It it it it it it it it. It floated Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again again again again again again again again again after a while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
