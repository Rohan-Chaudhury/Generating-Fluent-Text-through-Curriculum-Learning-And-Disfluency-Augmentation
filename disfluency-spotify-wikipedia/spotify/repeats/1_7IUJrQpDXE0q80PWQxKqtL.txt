Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about the the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor to to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often often finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do do find them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 years in in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking a lot about about how I can mentor more people how I can help more people. So I have have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be able to join me live live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me questions anything you like whatever you you are in the world for a fraction of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
