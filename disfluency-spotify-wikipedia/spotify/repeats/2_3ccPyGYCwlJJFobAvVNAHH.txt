Hello, welcome to the theology pug cast and we're glad to have you with us again. And And And it's the whole crew here today and we're going to do this ourselves in in in a minute, but guys, I realized just the other day that we've we've we've been at this for a year. Well, I think this is like episode 56 56 56 or something. Maybe it maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers out there there there to correct us, you know, occasionally we do say things that are not correct often often often speak for yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the show, but that that that just has because we do is almost zero prep. We just kind of come from from from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think most of the time time time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from someplace else. Never Never Never glad. I'm glad that I don't think it's ever happened to Glenn. I'm glad you you you got me last week on Warfield and Whitfield.
