Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter newsletter newsletter and the topic of today's video is going to be going with the the the flow and I got an email here from a client of mine that I've been been been coaching for is probably since late last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been been been coaching him now. Well maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got a a a couple of situations that he's asking me about so he basically he meets his his his All at a concert and I guess his group and her group of friends kind kind kind of emerged at some point, and she listened this. She says that she told him to to to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
