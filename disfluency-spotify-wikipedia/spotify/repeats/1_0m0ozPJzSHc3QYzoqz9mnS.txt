The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would would have had when we first started out this would have been way way way easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
