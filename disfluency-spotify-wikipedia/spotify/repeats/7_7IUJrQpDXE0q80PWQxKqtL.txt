Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about the the the the the the the the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor to help help help help help help help help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding that that that that that that that that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do find them them them them them them them them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive or they just just just just just just just just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 years in in in in in in in in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking a a a a a a a a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help more people. People people people people people people people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be able able able able able able able able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me questions anything you you you you you you you you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction of the cost that this this this this this this this this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
