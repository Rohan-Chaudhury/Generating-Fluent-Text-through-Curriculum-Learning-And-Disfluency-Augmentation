Happy birthday, the weed tube. You're two years old. And I love you. This is is fun to speculate a podcast where we speculate about wild and crazy ideas. And now now here's your host Aaron Richard. Hi everybody Welcome to a brand new episode episode of fun to speculate. I'm your host Aaron Richard and sitting next to me me is producer Vlad. Hi guys. I'm back. Well, yes you were sick last for for the last episode. That's right. Yeah, because in the grand scheme of things we recorded it's it's actually been a while since we like sat here to do and episode 2 because we we recorded so many episodes in like a three-day time span and we had a a nice little break in between and now we have to catch up and record one like like every week or schedule another week of insanity. That's okay though. I love this show. I love love this show. I want this show. I hope everyone in the world listens to to that's a little bit extreme, but, you know, I hope a lot of people people enjoy it. I hope we keep the topics coming in good thought-provoking ways, and I just hope we always keep it entertaining for you. So, thank you.
