Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So So So So So So So So So for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old old old old old old old old old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one of of of of of of of of of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she she she she she she she she she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I I I I I I I I I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
