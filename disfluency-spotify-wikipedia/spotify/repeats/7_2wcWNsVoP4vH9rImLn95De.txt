So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I I I I I I I I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I I I I I I I I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it it it it it it it it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know know know know know know know know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to to to to to to to to me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been been been been been been been been so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
