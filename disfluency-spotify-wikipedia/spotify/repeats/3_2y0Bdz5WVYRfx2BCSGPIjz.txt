together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets up up up up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be with with with with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the father father father father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him and he says says says says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I needed to be be be be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. They something absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude of Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
