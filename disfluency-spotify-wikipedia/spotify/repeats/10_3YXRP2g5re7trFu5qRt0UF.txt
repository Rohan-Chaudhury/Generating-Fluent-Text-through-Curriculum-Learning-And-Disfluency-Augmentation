You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because because because because because because because because because because because we're just here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking apart. So it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you you you you you you you you you you you ask that question, you know was a success not enough to sustain it. It it it it it it it it it it. I don't think it was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't weren't weren't weren't weren't weren't weren't weren't weren't weren't weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the the the the the the the the the the the Twitter can be totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run run run run run run run run run run run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
