So hopefully I'll be be be able to get through this introduction without losing my voice. So today's episode episode episode is something I couldn't wait to publish. The guest today is a fellow Irishman the very very very first wash guest of a podcast. And someone I have followed on social media for for for a long while now. I'd actually heard of this guest back on another another another podcast God over a year ago. Now whilst I was training for the London marathon and and and I remember listening thinking wow, this guy is crazy like what he has has has achieved. I was just bewildered by his achievements. He is an ultra runner from penarth Cardiff South Wales. His name is Reese Jenkins. He.
