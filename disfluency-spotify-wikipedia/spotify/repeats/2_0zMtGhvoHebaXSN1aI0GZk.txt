It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small small small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every every every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood blood blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is the the the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. Pancreas pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if if if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin insulin insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin insulin insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose glucose glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the the the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
