Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or or or or or or try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going going going going going going on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind behind behind behind behind behind this podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that that that that that that being real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's it's it's it's it's it's quite the opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability ability ability ability ability ability to continue to grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as as as as as as a reminder that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way way way way way way out when our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
