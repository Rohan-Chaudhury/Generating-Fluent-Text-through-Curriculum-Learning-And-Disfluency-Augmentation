My he thought I'll bet that person who lost that that that that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of of of of sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river river river river suddenly much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This This This This was obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated floated floated floated Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a a a a while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
