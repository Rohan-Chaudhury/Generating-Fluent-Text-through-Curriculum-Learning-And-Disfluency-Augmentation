But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Assets assets assets assets assets assets assets. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how how how how how how how how much money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life life life life life life life life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many many many many many many many many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this this this this this this this this is our time for us to be together and for me to answer your your your your your your your your questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I I I I I I I I am but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and and and and and and and and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
