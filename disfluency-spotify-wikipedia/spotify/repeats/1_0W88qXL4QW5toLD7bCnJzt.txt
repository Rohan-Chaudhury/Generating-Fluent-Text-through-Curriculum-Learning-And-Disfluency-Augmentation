Hey dedicated listener to The Machinist therapy hotline, as you can imagine when we we are recording our podcast. We have hours of audio that we have to sift through through more often than not the level of conversation is at such a high intellectual intellectual point that we're not sure if it really can get into the podcast. We thought thought we might share one of them with you now, but remember if if you want to be involved, don't forget. You send us a DM. Send us your questions questions and we'll go from there. We hope you enjoyed today's episode. Thanks. I I did I did the whole sort of winning the Florida when the Clear Water Water went down.
