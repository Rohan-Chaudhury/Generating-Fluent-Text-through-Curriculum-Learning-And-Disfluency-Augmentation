And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about about about anchor which if we would have had when we first started out this would have have have been way way easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, easy, easy, you know, so anchor is by far the easiest way to make a podcast podcast podcast it gives you everything you need. In one place so you don't have to get get get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make make make a podcast and edit it on your phone right there free.
