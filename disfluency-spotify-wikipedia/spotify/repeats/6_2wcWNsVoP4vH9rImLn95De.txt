So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach coach coach coach coach coach coach because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard hard hard hard hard hard hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into into into into into into into this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I I I I I I I know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop loop loop loop loop loop loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me me me me me me me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so so so so so so so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
