My he thought thought thought I'll bet that person who lost that hat is very sorry now after the the the Hat had floated out of sight. Around the corner of the house the the the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to his surprise. Here comes comes comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very strange. So the lad lad lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of the house and and and came floating back down again after a while. It came back Upstream yet again again again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
