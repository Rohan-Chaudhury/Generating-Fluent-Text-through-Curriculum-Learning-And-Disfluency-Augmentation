Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree tree tree tree tree tree tree of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I I I I I I I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds sounds sounds sounds sounds sounds sounds of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Forget forget forget forget forget forget. Your breath the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. High high high high high high. You make me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
