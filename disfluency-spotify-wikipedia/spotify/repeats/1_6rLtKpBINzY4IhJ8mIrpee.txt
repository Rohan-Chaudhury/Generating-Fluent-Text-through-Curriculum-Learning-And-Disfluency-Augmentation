Okay, Karen tell me something. Something. Have you watched Pok√©mon? Yes here on there. Yes, you washed Beyblade. Yes, and it it was a culture. Where back where? I when I when we grew up so we we should just hang around and you know oracle 3 2 1 let it rip rip or whatever, right? Yeah. So yeah, it was a throwback and nostalgic moment. Yes, Yes, I have so everyone has actually watched anime when they were kids. They They just don't realize it. So it's like shows Pokemon Digimon and Doraemon Shin-chan Ninja Ninja Hattori. They're all enemies now that I think about it. Beyblade was The Craze back when we were in.
