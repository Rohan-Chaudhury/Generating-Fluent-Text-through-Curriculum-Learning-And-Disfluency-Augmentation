Welcome to the hottest take my name is Chris Ryan. I am joined by Jason Jason Jason concepci√≥n Juliet Littman and David Shoemaker and David you have before. I know that we we we fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country needs is a a a king. Oh my God now listen. Listen, I'm not saying we need a monarch with with with absolute power. I'm not saying we need to go to some like Royal Dutch like diagnostic system. System system. But look at England right now how much better would our political discourse be be be if we would just elect the king for every like a decade every 10 years. Years years. Donald Trump gets to be king. But we have a like a boring-ass technocrat. Who's Who's Who's They're as prime minister is actually making the decision, right? So he's have a a a guy who's a guy or a gal whose job is to go to NASCAR races and and and give speeches and set off. The first fireworks on the fourth of July. If you want to figure out is what I want a figure, how did.
