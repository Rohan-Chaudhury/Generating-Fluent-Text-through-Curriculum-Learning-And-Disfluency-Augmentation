It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small range range range range range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. If If If If If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose levels are are are are are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is the movement of water between between between between between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect detect detect detect detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood blood blood blood blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver liver liver liver liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored stored stored stored stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. Concentration concentration concentration concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
