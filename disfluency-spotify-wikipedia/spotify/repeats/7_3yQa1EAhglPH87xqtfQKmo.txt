Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic of of of of of of of of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This is something something something something something something something something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is you're not not not not not not not not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel like things are are are are are are are are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel like like like like like like like like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're going to to to to to to to to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's going to feel hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially especially especially especially especially especially especially especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling you what a stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you want to build or that career career career career career career career career you want to have is just unrealistic for you. So I've got an email email email email email email email email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
