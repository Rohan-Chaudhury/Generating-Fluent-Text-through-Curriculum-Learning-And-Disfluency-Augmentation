I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of of of of of living with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived perceived perceived perceived perceived problems and worries going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. The simple simple simple simple simple fact that we all only have one life and that none of us us us us us are promised another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Of our current current current current current health status after all would you seriously stay in the job you hate or the the the the the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your life could end next year. Year year year year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you happy and you you you you you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this groundbreaking podcast. Podcast podcast podcast podcast. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
