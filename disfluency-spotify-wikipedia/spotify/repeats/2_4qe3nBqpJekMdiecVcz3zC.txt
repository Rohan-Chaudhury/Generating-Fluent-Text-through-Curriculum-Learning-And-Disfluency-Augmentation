Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the the the topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind kind kind of interesting email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work work work and telling me how just in a short period of time. He's in in in a situation where I guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting getting getting a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she she she was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing is is is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the the the interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his his his wife without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
