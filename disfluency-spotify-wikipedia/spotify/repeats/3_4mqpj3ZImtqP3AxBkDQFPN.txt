I have had some some some some shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one one one one of which is the fact that I have literally not had a job for for for for the past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like like like like a gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and and and and my bank account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for for for for a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
