We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor mentor mentor to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding finding finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do find them them them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive or they they they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 years years years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking a lot lot lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help more people. So So So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be be be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask me me me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction of the the the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
