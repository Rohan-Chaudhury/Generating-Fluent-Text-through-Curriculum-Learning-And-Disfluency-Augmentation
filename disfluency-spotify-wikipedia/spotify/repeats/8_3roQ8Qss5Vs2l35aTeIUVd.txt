Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that that that that that that that that that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of of of of of of of of of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed to sit on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump on it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on on on on on on on on on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell tell tell tell tell tell tell tell tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
