Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a a a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography choreography choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to to to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the the the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I I I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not even thinking thinking thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just filled music and what happens happens happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up up up and you don't know what that's going to be or when it will be but but but it just happens after you listen to it for a while and then then then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when when when those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So So So those little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
