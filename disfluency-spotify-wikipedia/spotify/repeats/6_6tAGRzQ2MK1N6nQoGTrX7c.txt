Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through through through through through through through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down on on on on on on on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can also do do do do do do do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure that that that that that that that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you have your legs legs legs legs legs legs legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet Flat on the ground ground ground ground ground ground ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either you're sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. Navel navel navel navel navel navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
