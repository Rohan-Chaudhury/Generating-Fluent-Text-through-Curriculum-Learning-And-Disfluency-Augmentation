Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be be be be be be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become become become become become become more masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such such such such such such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control control control control control control their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control control control control control control of what they would like and as a man this is important to to to to to to your success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if if if if if if you want to become a man of value so that way other men men men men men men or other people in general can lean on you. You're going to have to to to to to to learn this. So here's the deal. If you don't have a very high attention attention attention attention attention attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five five five five five five minutes, you're not going to do very well. Okay, because this video might take take take take take take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you you you you you you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
