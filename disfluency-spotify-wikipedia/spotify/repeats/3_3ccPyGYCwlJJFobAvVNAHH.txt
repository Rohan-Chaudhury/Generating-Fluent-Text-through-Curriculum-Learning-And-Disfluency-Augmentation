And it's the whole crew here today and we're going to do this this this this ourselves in a minute, but guys, I realized just the other day that we've we've we've we've been at this for a year. Well, I think this is like episode 56 56 56 56 or something. Maybe it maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers out there to to to to correct us, you know, occasionally we do say things that are not correct often speak speak speak speak for yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the show, but that just just just just has because we do is almost zero prep. We just kind of come from from from from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think most of the time time time time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from someplace else. Never glad. Glad glad glad. I'm glad that I don't think it's ever happened to Glenn. I'm glad you you you you got me last week on Warfield and Whitfield.
