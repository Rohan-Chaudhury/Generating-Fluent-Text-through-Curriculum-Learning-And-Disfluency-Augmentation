You are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. I'm going going to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's let's see here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to to believe that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of that that kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get get together. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a a while, but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent the last last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I met her her and she has spent all these years doing that. So she's going to to share some of her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. Discussion. I have to apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I need to to do before I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
