Hello and welcome back to the not another Runner podcast. Thank you so so much for joining today. I am so thankful that you have downloaded this this episode and that you choose to listen today. I've had an awful cold all week. So So hopefully I'll be able to get through this introduction without losing my voice. So So today's episode is something I couldn't wait to publish. The guest today is a a fellow Irishman the very first wash guest of a podcast. And someone I I have followed on social media for a long while now. I'd actually heard of this guest guest back on another podcast God over a year ago. Now whilst I was training for the London London marathon and I remember listening thinking wow, this guy is crazy like what he has has achieved. I was just bewildered by his achievements. He is an ultra runner from penarth Cardiff South Wales. His name is Reese Jenkins. He.
