Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to leave leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this this on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I know know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot freak freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're / like fractions fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view of of a player but we did learn some things some players had much better showing showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
