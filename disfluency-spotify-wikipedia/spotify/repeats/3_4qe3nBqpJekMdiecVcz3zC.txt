Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and and and and the topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind kind kind kind of interesting email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my my my my work and telling me how just in a short period of time. He's in in in in a situation where I guess his he's been married. And he's in the process process process process of getting a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. Ago ago ago. He found out she was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. Apparently apparently apparently. So the interesting thing is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, divorce, divorce, divorce, but the interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his his his his wife without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
