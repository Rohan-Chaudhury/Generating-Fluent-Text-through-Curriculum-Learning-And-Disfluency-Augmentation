Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the kids kids kids kids kids kids kids kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in this household household household household household household household household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch not not not not not not not not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. It it it it it it it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they they they they they they they they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when when when when when when when when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
