Hello, welcome to the theology pug cast and we're glad to have you with with us again. And it's the whole crew here today and we're going to to do this ourselves in a minute, but guys, I realized just the other day day that we've been at this for a year. Well, I think this is like episode episode 56 or something. Maybe it maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers out out there to correct us, you know, occasionally we do say things that are not correct correct often speak for yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the show, show, but that just has because we do is almost zero prep. We just kind of of come from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think most most of the time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from from someplace else. Never glad. I'm glad that I don't think it's ever ever happened to Glenn. I'm glad you got me last week on Warfield and whitfield. Whitfield. I've not heard the end of it my colleague Frank a mullet. Yeah initially when you.
