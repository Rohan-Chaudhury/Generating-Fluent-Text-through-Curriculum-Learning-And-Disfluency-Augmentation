You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and and and and and and and and and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to to to to to to to to to work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a a a a a a a a a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers writers writers writers writers writers writers writers writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the project we we we we we we we we we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but not necessarily and and and and and and and and and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse behind the the the the the the the the the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from time time time time time time time time time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
