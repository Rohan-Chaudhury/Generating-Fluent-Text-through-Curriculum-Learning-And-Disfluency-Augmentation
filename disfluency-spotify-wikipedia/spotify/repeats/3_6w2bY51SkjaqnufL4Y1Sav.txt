Yes. Hi. I am calling this number because I saw it on a bathroom bathroom bathroom bathroom wall. See if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is going to to to to hell and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have Adam Breeze of of of of Raven I with us but before we hop into that, I just wanted to to to to go over I sold myself short on the last episode about my romantic capabilities. I I I I think I came up on the last. Episode saying that I don't remember remember remember remember what I got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards out, out, out, out, but I personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got him a heart-shaped heart-shaped heart-shaped heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got him Star Wars Wars Wars Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
