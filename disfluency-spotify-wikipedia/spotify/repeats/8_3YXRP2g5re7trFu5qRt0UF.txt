You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because because because because because because because because because we're just here to serve each other to get this money and then we we we we we we we we we walking apart. So it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask ask ask ask ask ask ask ask ask that question, you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't think it was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each each each each each each each each each other. Meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be be be be be be be be be totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
