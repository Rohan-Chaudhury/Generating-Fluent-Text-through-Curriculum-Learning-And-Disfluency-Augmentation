Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old school school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one of my my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she saw in in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was about about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. But But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
