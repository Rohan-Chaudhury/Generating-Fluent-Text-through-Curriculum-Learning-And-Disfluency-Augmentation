Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things things things things things things things things things things things well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the the the the the the the the the the the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us us us us us us us us us us us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on on on on on on on on on on on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it it it it it it it it it it it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. It it it it it it it it it it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to to to to to to to to to to to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, couch, couch, couch, couch, couch, couch, couch, couch, couch, couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell tell tell tell tell tell tell tell tell tell tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
