So hey, if we have not met, my name is Adam Ludlow Ludlow CEO and head coach of rewired Fitness comb. We are a fitness based community in North North Spokane that does coach lead strength and conditioning this podcast is honestly something something that's been on my mind for a while and it's time for it to to go. So here we go with episode. I want to talk a little bit about about why we're doing this and what to expect and who it's for. So let's get right right into it. The why honestly it's because one of our values that we've always always had for our fitness Community that's six and a half years old is to to always be improving.
