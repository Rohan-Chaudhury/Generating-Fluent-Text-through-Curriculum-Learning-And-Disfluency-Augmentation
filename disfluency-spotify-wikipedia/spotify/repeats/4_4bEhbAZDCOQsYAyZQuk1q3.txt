Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard hard hard hard hard towards Ascension. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I I I I I am joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the the the the the dream speakers in another episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I thought thought thought thought thought it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. Doing doing doing doing. I am doing fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about about about about about the woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about about about about about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it it it it it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours hours hours hours hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer time time time time time and North American summer time do not occur at the same time. So I'm like, let's let's let's let's let's figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I can can can can can wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
