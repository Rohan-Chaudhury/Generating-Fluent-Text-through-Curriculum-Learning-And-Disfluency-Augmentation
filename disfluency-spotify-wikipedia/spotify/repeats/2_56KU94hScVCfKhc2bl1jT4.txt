Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I I I really appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying studying studying the Bible in this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, text, text, which is something we don't often talk about enough, but we need to to to we need to talk about it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting interesting interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 17 17 1 to 9, which is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and and and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain where they they they could be alone. There in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
