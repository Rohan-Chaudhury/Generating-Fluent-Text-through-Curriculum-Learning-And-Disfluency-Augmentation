What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S S S S S S S S S S S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from from from from from from from from from from from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to to to to to to to to to to to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were were were were were were were were were were were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for for for for for for for for for for for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really really really really really really really really really really really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and and and and and and and and and and and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten gotten gotten gotten gotten gotten gotten gotten gotten gotten gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like like like like like like like like like like like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Performance Performance Performance Performance Performance Performance Performance Performance Performance Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but but but but but but but but but but but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
