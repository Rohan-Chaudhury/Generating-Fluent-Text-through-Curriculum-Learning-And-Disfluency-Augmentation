What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the the the the the the the the the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and and and and and and and and and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about about about about about about about about about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third row row row row row row row row row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and and and and and and and and and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's It's It's It's It's It's It's It's It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new new new new new new new new new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and and and and and and and and and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and and and and and and and and and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's It's It's It's It's It's It's It's It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like like like like like like like like like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to to to to to to to to to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, example, example, example, example, example, example, example, example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
