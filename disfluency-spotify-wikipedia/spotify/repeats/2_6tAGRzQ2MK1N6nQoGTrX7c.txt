Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through through through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying laying laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. Sides sides. You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting sitting sitting you want to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair chair chair or a wall if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting sitting sitting in a chair have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up up up with your knees. So once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with with with your hands, I want you to find your navel. So with your thumbs thumbs thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
