Guys, welcome back to the not so serious podcast. This is the fifth fifth episode. I believe unfortunately Christian the co-founder of this podcast is not able able to join this week because he is on spring break. He's living it up up in Spain. What up Christian are you doing? But this week we have three very special special guests from Lehigh University. Number one, Matt Fisher my roommate what up, what up, dude and Nicole and Martina the first female guest on the not so serious podcast, they're all very nervous.
