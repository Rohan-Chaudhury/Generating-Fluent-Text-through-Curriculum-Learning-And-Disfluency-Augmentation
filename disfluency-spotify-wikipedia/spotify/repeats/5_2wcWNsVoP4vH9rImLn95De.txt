So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I have have have have have have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I had had had had had had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it can be be be be be be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this pattern of of of of of of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know better better better better better better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop and it's it's it's it's it's it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me me me me me me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
