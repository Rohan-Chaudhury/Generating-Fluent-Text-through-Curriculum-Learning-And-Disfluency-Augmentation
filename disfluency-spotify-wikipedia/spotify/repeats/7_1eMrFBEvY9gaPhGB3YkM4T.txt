I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. Again again again again again again again. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the the the the the the the the small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Here here here here here here here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It It It It It It It It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first thing thing thing thing thing thing thing thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my my my my my my my my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
