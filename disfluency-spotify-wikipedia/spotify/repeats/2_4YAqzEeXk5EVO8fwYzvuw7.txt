Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast podcast podcast with your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for for for tuning in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the the the who what why when and how of this podcast. So before you decide decide decide to listen to me, let me at least help you understand who I am. I've been been been an RD for about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. Places places. I started off at a nursing home from there. I was able to go into into into a clinic Uncle setting working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it it it to the Private Practice World, which is really where I wanted to to to be I was able to sit with people for longer periods of time we set set set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were able to see each other for for for a bit more than five or ten minutes and you're working in the the the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes in between the doctors. Doctors doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've been here for a a a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
