Hey everyone, so I wanted to take a second to just tell you a little little bit about anchor it's the app that I use to record my podcasts. I absolutely absolutely love it. It's completely free. There. Are these really awesome creation tools that that allow you to record and edit your podcast right from your phone or your your computer and anchor distribute your podcast for you. So you can hear it on on Spotify Apple podcasts and many other platforms you are able to make money from your your podcast. You don't need to have a minimum listenership. And it's just really everything that you you need to make a podcast in one place. So I find it really useful useful and accessible and really helpful. You can download the free anchor app or go go to Anchor dot f m-- to get started and I'm telling you it's just just like the easiest way to get your feet wet and jump into creating creating your own podcast.
