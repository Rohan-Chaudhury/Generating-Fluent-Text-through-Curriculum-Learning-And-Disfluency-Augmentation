Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic topic topic topic of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This This This This is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is is is is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel feel feel feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel like like like like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're going going going going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's going to feel feel feel feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if if if if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling you what a a a a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you want to build or that that that that career you want to have is just unrealistic for you. So I've got an an an an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
