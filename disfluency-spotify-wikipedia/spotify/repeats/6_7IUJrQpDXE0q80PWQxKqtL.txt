Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about the the the the the the the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor to to to to to to to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding that that that that that that that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we we we we we we we do find them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been been been been been been been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help help help help help help help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group group group group group group group here. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can can can can can can can ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
