What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk talk about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. Episode. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. Thing. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what I think is is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
