You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and and and and and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work on their their their their their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a day or or or or or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers producers or or or or or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the the the the the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but but but but but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's It's It's It's It's a glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color color color color color from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
