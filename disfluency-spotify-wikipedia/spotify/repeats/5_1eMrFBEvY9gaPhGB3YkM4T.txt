Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was was was was was was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of my my my my my my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, again, again, again, again, again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on on on on on on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I I I I I I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first thing thing thing thing thing thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral vision. Vision vision vision vision vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
