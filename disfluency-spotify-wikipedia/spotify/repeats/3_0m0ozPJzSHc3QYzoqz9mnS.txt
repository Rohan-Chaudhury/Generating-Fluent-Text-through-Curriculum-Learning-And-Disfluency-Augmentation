The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were were were were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how how how how we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And And And And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if if if if we would have had when we first started out this would have been way way way way way easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so so so so anchor is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything everything everything everything you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any any any any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit edit edit edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives gives gives gives you all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good good good good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
