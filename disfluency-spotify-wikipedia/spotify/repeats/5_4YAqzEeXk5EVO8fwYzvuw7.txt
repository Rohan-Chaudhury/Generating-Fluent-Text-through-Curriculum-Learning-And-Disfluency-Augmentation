So before you you you you you you decide to listen to me, let me at least help you understand who I am. Am am am am am. I've been an RD for about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. Places places places places places. I started off at a nursing home from there. I was able to go into a a a a a a clinic Uncle setting working at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the the the the the the Private Practice World, which is really where I wanted to be I was able to to to to to to sit with people for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had had had had had had follow-ups and we were able to see each other for a bit more than five or or or or or or ten minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a a a a a a couple minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this this this this this this point because they've been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
