Thank you for for joining us for our first ever episode of doing quarterly podcast. And this week. We We are celebrating women. I'll is international Women's Day on Sunday the 8th of March, so so we thought it'd be a good opening topic as two female podcast. Has Amy what what could stuff have you heard in the news this week? Okay, so I know know in a moment you're going to be talking about a really huge piece of news news that was covered in the media last week. So I thought it might be nice nice for me to start with maybe a slightly smaller you story that people haven't necessarily necessarily heard about and I was scrolling through Twitter last week and stumbled across an article article about hair salons and basically a number of salons across the UK have been boycotting gossip magazines.
