As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and and and and and and a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it it it it it it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was was was was was was through the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which which which which which which was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students students students students students students not our number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could win win win win win win and there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not not not not not not too sure what is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind kind kind kind kind kind of curve that but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So So So So So So nobody was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
