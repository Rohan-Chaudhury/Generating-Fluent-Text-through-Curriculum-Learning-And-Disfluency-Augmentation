And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking looking looking at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using using using and speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart heart heart behind this is that as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously obviously obviously avoid but we will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. Different different. I am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
