What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford in London, Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little little little little little little little pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the the the the the the the Leafs loss in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a a a a a a a row prior The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to sort sort sort sort sort sort sort of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that we're we're we're we're we're we're we're key games against teams that were at least on par with them Florida a few few few few few few few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and and and and and and and Vancouver who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come up against the the the the the the the team and they play three teams on this west coast swing that are out of of of of of of of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string and they they they they they they they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
