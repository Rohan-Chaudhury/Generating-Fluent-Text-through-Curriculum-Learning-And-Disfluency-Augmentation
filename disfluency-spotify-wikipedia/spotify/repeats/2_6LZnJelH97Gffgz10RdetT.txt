Hello, everyone. Dr. Davidson Edmund. I hope everybody's doing very well and staying staying staying healthy. Today we're going to talk about their coronavirus. But first of all, I'd like to to to introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm a a a board certified Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see you about about about 40 50 patients a day and the office I'll still go to the hospital and usually usually usually have a census. It's been 5 to 15 patients, including ICU and critical heal patients. Patients patients. So literally my patients have been very worried about the core virus and to be be be honest who is not been worried about this. Okay? And therefore I've had multiple questions regarding, you know, what what what they can do to protect.
