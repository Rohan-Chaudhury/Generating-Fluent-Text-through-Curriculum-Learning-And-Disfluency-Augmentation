Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very traumatized traumatized traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of my my my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, again, again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on on on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I also also also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't didn't didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first first first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in in in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
