The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that that that that that were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how how how how how we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you know, know, know, know, know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would would would would would have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier and and and and and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by by by by by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you you you you you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit edit edit edit edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it it it it it gives you all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it it it it it sound good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
