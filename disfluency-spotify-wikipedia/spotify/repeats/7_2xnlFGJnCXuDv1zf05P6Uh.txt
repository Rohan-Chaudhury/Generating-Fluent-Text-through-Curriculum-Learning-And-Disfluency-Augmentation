What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about about about about about about about about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S S S S S S S S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about about about about about about about about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third third third third third third third third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and and and and and and and and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. 3 3 3 3 3 3 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really really really really really really really really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new new new new new new new new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the the the the the the the the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And And And And And And And And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of of of of of of of of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of of of of of of of of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is is is is is is is is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
