I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of of of of of of of of living with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived perceived perceived perceived perceived perceived perceived perceived problems and worries going on in our heads could be changed by by by by by by by by embracing. The simple fact that we all only have one life and that none of of of of of of of of us are promised another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home home home home home home home home regardless. Of our current health status after all would you seriously stay in the the the the the the the the job you hate or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your life life life life life life life life could end next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make make make make make make make make you happy and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either either either either either either either either in this groundbreaking podcast. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
