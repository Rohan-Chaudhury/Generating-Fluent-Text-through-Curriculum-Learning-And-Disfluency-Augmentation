Just talking about random stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I I I I I I I I recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what what what what what what what what the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of of of of of of of of the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health health health health health health health health growing up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. Adult adult adult adult adult adult adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. Up up up up up up up.
