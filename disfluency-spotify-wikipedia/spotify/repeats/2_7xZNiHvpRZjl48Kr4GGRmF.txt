Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I I I have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk about about about like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the the the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have have have to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea Shea Shea tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading reading reading Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under under under a rock right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just just just to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when when when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his his his Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
