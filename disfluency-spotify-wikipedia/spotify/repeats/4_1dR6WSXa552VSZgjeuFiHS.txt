Love Theology Theology Theology Theology Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money money money money money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your your your your your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many many many many many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is our our our our our time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So here here here here here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 years. Years years years years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I am but it's it's it's it's it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their families. I promise I I I I I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
