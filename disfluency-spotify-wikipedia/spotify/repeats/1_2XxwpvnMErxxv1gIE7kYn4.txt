Let's talk about about a statement from Brandi Love about her and her her husband's relationship whether whether it's an open relationship with that. I don't know how it will have fun. Alright, stay stay tuned. Welcome to the quickie and first before we get into the show, if you you haven't heard about anchor before downloading it this time, it is the easiest way to make make a podcast and I encourage you to make your own podcast. It's fun and it's it's free. It's free to download is free to be chord you talk. Anyway, you you have conversations. Anyway, why not record it and make money while you're doing doing it. There are creation tools that allow you to record and edit your podcast right right from your phone or your computer. Anchor will distribute your podcast for you.
