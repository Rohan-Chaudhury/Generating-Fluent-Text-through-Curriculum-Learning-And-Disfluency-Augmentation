Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as as as as as as as as as as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. Life life life life life life life life life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and and and and and and and and and and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making love love love love love love love love love love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath Breath Breath Breath Breath Breath Breath Breath Breath Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher than than than than than than than than than than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
