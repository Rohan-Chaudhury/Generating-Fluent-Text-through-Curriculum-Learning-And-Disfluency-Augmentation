Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I am too but I'm trying to to pretend I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this podcast episode episode set up because my microphone I feel like it's only really good good for one person and that I feel like our audio is always a little off off and you guys have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it we're probably probably going to have to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome to yeah, we we said it with me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time tuning in. This This is a mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice questions that you emailed to me and and Miss thing at gmail.com. And I would say it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
