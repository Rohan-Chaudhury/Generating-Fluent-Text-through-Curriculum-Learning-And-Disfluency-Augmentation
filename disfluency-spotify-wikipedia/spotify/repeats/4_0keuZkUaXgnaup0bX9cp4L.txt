And also the way that the World perhaps disables disables disables disables disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do do do do do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea of of of of of ableism and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied able-bodied able-bodied able-bodied able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a a a a a very specific way.
