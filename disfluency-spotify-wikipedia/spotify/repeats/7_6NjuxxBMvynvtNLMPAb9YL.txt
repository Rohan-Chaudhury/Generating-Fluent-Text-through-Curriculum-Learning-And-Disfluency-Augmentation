Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release release release release release release release release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened listened listened listened listened listened listened listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in in in in in in in in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but but but but but but but but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's It's It's It's It's It's It's It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand stand stand stand stand stand stand stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's going to be or when it will be but it just happens after after after after after after after after you listen to it for a while and then when you actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come come come come come come come come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your your your your your your your your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
