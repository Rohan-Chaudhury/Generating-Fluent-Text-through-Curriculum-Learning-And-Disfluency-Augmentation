Hello and welcome back into the hard foul. I'm your host Pearson Fowler with with me as always from Gamecock central.com the bad luck charm in South Carolina Gamecocks this this entire weekend Colin Taylor Colin. I hate that you have to wear that that albatross around your neck, but you had a busy weekend. He did a lot of of travel. It's much appreciated Gamecock fans everywhere appreciate your vigilance your dedication to traveling traveling and I sound like I'm being sarcastic because it's not a clock. In the the morning, but I'm being serious because Friday you were in Colombia. You covered the baseball baseball game and then Saturday morning you woke up and drove to Tuscaloosa. Watch the the basketball game. And then you said you stayed overnight in Hoover or Birmingham somewhere thereabouts thereabouts and then drove to Clemson, South Carolina first thing Sunday morning to cover the the baseball game then came back to Colombia. And the now you are are back here in downtown Columbia at nine o'clock on Monday morning again admirable seriously everybody appreciates.
