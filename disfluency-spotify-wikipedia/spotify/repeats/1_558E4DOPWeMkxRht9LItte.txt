Hi late, Friday morning your head spend all those more working on my Saturday night night talk for tomorrow night, and I'm still doing the history series and also Snow ending ending with other work and Purim stuff. I always have a cebit my house. I'm I'm pouring and now I always try to put together something as I mentioned the the other day. I'd only time I ever write anything down is Is there something going to to shop a super work for husbands or also for Purim believe it or not? not Because they always write a five or six or seven page Arturo whatever couple whatever did did I like the liver because important you drink, you know know, you know, you can't can't remember what you're saying. So I have a text in front of me. So So hopefully you can't go wrong and my son from Israel wrote me that sent him a driver toga. For his Yeshiva, and now they're going through the.
