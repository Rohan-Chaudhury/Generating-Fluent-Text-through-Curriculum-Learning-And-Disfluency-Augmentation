Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may may may ask that is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven years old old old Nate nasty couple of nicknames. He had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Ace Qbert boos. Boos Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I assure you I'm I'm I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years but the reason reason reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because he has a propensity propensity propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four weeks at a time or maybe maybe maybe even a couple days when I get my sad boy moments. I'm talking six months months months to a year. This man can disappear at times. He has a lot of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
