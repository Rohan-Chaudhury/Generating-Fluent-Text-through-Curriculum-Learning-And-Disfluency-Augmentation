The simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple fact that we all only have one life and that none of us are promised promised promised promised promised promised promised promised promised another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Of our our our our our our our our our current health status after all would you seriously stay in the job you you you you you you you you you hate or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt felt felt felt felt felt felt felt felt your life could end next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that that that that that that that that that make you happy and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either either either either either either either either either in this groundbreaking podcast. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
