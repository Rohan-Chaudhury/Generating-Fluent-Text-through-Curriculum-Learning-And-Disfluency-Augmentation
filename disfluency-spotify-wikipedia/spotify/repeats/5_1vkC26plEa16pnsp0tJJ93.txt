Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to to to to to to leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording recording recording recording recording recording this on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple couple couple couple couple couple days to digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're we're we're we're we're we're going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the the the the the the combine. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have have have have have have to reiterate you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are are are are are are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, example, example, example, example, example, but they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly swinging your view of a player but we did learn some things some players players players players players players had much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
