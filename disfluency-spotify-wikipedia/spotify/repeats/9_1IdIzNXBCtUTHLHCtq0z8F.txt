Yeah, and and and and and and and and and and we recorded this coming episode. This guests really really early. We did we did. This This This This This This This This This This is actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this little Snippets recorded after after after after after after after after after after your episode. Halftime, so we actually did have our guests on a little bit earlier this this this this this this this this this this week. Yeah, when he was here because of the way that you know, this Gus could could could could could could could could could could make it around but you know, we're recording the intro after we record the actual actual actual actual actual actual actual actual actual actual episode. Typically. We like to record the intro this this snippet part without the guest even even even even even even even even even even being around. Yeah. So it just the way it works. So usually we recorded before before before before before before before before before before the guest shows up this last step the set this guess we didn't have time to to to to to to to to to to yeah.
