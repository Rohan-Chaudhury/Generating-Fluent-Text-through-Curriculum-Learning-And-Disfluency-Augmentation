Yo, yo, yo, what's up everyone? I guess I'll kick off this podcast addressing probably probably probably probably probably the biggest talk in sports right now. Tom Brady greatest of all time Now Now Now Now Now if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you that he's he's he's he's he's staying put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying put it it it it it just doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody that has been been been been been in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one one one one one team just doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense to to to to to me. So it doesn't make sense to me for this man the go go go go go out and play for another team at 43 years old after spending his entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just doesn't make sense for.
