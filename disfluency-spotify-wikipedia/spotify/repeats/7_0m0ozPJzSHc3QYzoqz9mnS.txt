And you you you you you you you you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have have have have have have have have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier easier easier easier easier easier easier easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by by by by by by by by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. Need need need need need need need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on on on on on on on on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all all all all all all all all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you you you you you you you you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
