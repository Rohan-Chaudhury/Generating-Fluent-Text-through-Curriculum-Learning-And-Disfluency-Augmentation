Hello, you lovely bunch and welcome back to yes, another episode of the vitalife show me Tori Tori Tori and Me Myself and Irene. I have nobody on this podcast and there's a good good good reason for it. I also just want to say if the sound quality sound sound sound slightly different. I do apologize. I haven't got my headphones and that is because because because I am currently in the middle of moving so I have packed my my my whole life up not thinking that I needed me. Fines and I'm in the the the middle of a hotel because I also started a new job last week. And And And yeah, it's all decided to come at once. But the reason I actually actually actually chose to do this podcast and do this by myself is because it's something that that that I want to talk to you about just from my own personal experience for once to to to a perfectly honest, obviously with being mental health months and the last couple of episodes to kind of touching on Mental Health.
