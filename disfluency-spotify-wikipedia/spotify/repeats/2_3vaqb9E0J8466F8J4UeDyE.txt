Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you you you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported reported reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description description description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly certainly certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced announced announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something something something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner winner winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this this this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all y'all y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've I've I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Clare Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out out out on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight tonight tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
