The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were friends friends friends friends friends friends friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we do it it it it it it it how we get it out there how we record it. And you know, thankfully thankfully thankfully thankfully thankfully thankfully thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have had when we we we we we we we first started out this would have been way way easier and it's much easier. Easier easier easier easier easier easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far the easiest way way way way way way way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. In one place so so so so so so so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or or or or or or or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on your phone right right right right right right right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the creation tools. You need need need need need need need to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if we didn't have have have have have have have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
