Sunday seems to be our day where we really try to get our act act together before the work week. It includes the kids because we really enjoy our time off off on Saturdays and Sundays as a family and we just got a lotta things things that we tend to do on the weekends. We're busy but Sunday, especially given given against towards the evening as like look kids. Do you have any homework homework what needs to be done for tomorrow? Get your clothes out clean your rooms. Let's start start packing lunches. Etc it's it's just a reminder that we gotta get back to work work and school tomorrow morning. I like teasing my kids at this time because it's it's a i you guys. I know that school is your favorite. You guys can't even even wait to go back and like know I hate school. I don't think they they really do like I think they like to see their friends. But yeah schools schools work and their you're not in kindergarten anymore, right? We got through versus third grade.
