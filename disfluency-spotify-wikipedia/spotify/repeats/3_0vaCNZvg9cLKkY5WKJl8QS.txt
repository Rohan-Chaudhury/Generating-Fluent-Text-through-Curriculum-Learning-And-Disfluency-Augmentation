So this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and man. There are some nuggets nuggets nuggets nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear it. If this this this this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going back and and and and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think that all of the the the the information in part to her story all her tips the way that she parents it's all all all all like so much more interesting and almost more like valuable when you know where she she she she came from part 1 is all about her life as a young girl how she was parented parented parented parented her family story Dynamic her as a young woman and it's fascinating and it it it it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
