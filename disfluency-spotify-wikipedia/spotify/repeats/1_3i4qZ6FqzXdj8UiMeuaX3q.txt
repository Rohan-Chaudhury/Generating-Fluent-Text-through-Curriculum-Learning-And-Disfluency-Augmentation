Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm your host host Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock central.com Kyle and Taylor here to to talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite impressive 12-point home victory over the the Mississippi State Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and and they did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they they got up big early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that that lead going into halftime and then by the second half things kind of evened out out in South Carolina, they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by by 12 and most of the time they were up by like six or something like like that but it felt comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular spectacular performance but a lot of good performances from a lot of different areas and and as much as we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
