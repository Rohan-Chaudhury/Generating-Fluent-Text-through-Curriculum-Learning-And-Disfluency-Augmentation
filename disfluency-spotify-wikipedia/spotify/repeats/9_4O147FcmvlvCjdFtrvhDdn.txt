Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if if if if if if if if if if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that that that that that that that that that that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the the the the the the the the the the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was was was was was was was was was was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something something something something something something something something something something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to to to to to to to to to to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would would would would would would would would would would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no no no no no no no no no no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in in in in in in in in in in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if if if if if if if if if if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her her her her her her her her her her earlier today.
