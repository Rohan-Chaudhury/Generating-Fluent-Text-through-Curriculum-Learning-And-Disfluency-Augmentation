Grand Prince Vasily the third ruler of Muscovy raced toward his wife's bed chamber chamber chamber chamber the fateful day had finally arrived. His first child was about to be born as as as as he rushed past the Windows. He heard the crack of thunder and a deluge deluge deluge deluge of rain spattering against the glass. He stopped in his tracks the weather reminding reminding reminding reminding him of a prophecy. He'd heard years before if you do. Do this evil thing you you you you shall have an evil son your nation shall become prey to Terrors and tears rivers rivers rivers rivers of blood will flow. The heads of the mighty will fall your cities will be devoured devoured devoured devoured by Flames. He shook his head. He couldn't think about those words now his sin sin sin sin had already been committed now, he must be beside his wife in greet his child in the midst of the Wind and Rain.
