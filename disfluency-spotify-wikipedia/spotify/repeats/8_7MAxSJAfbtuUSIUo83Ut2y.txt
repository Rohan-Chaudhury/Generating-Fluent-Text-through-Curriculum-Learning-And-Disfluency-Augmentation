As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot and a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that that that that that that that that that so it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was was was was was was was was was through the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, room, room, room, room, room, room, room, room, which was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not not not not not not not not not our number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and and and and and and and and and there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure sure sure sure sure sure sure sure sure what is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but but but but but but but but but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was was was was was was was was was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
