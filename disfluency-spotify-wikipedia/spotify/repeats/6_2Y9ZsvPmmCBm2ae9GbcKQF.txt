I thought you you you you you you you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know know know know know know know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded the past past past past past past past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme of this podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast should be.
