So the time is probably going to come when I delete all these these episodes right? I think so. I don't want to just let it sit here if I'm I'm not using it, but what's happening today why I'm talking to you today is because it's warm warm out. I think it's in the 50s to me. This is warm when outside was was still wearing a light down coat. Had all my stuff with me as most New New Yorkers do we're always carrying stuff. Just taking out the trash. Too warm All All right. Someone's actually letting me cross. I'm shocked. Thank you. Almost got killed killed by someone before crossing the street. Thank you for being polite. So I was too too hot. I came downstairs light down coat scarf in my bag too hot went back up put.
