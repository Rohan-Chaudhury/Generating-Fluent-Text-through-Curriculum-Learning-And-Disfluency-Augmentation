We are stoked because today is part part part part part part part part part 2 of the October Gonzalez interview and we have been absolutely dying to release this this this this this this this this this one. So this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and man. There are are are are are are are are are some nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear it. If If If If If If If If If this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going back and and and and and and and and and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think that that that that that that that that that all of the information in part to her story all her tips the way that that that that that that that that that she parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost more like valuable when when when when when when when when when you know where she came from part 1 is all about her life as as as as as as as as as a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her as a a a a a a a a a young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
