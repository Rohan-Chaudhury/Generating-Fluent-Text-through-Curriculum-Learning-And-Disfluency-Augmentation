This is actually actually actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this little Snippets recorded after after after your episode. Halftime, so we actually did have our guests on a little bit bit bit earlier this week. Yeah, when he was here because of the way that you know, this this this Gus could make it around but you know, we're recording the intro after we record record record the actual episode. Typically. We like to record the intro this this snippet part part part without the guest even being around. Yeah. So it just the way it works. Works works.
