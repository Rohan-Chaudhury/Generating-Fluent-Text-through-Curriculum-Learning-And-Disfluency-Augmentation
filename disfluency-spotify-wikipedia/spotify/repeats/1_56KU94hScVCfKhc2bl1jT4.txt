Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really appreciate appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible Bible in this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something something we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to to talk about it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite quite unlike everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which which is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother brother John and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. Alone. There in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
