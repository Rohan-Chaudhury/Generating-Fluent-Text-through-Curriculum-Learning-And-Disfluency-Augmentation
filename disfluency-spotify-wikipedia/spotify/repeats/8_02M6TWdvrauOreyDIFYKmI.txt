Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly weekly podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as so far far far far far far far far far and want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made a mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she put out and and and and and and and and and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it that I I I I I I I I I said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but You You You You You You You You You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it right right right right right right right right right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
