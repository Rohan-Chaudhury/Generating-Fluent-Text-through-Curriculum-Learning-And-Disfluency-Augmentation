Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Claire Claire Claire Claire Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie Maddie Maddie Maddie Maddie Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she she she she she she has to be the winner of this season, right?
