Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as as as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of of of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm calm calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making making making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath of of of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher higher higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
