We're recording this this this this this this this this this this this on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to to to to to to to to to to to digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to to to to to to to to to to to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I I I I I I I I I I I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I I I I I I I I I I I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're / like like like like like like like like like like like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view of a player player player player player player player player player player player but we did learn some things some players had much better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
