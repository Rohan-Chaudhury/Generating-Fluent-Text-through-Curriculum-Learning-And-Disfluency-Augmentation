Hi all 90-day Bri here with your tea on AfterBuzz TVs. 90-day fiance News News Daily. We haven't gotten to see much of Stephanie on the new season season of a for the 90 days, but we know that she has a plastic anemia that that her girlfriend from the show lives in Australia and that her family is unaware that that she's dating a woman what you might not know about Stephanie though is that she she sells naked photos of herself online. That's right. Stephanie has a patron where she has has content. That's a bit risque. It seems some people may have found this this out though as Stephanie took her Instagram stories to lay everything out. Out she states states that she is not ashamed of this content and that having the patron has financed her her documentary as well as other creative projects and it's also helped her income in general. General. She ends it saying I'm a hello an advocate a writer a content creator a dumbass. Dumbass. I'm allowed to be everything. I'm allowed to love whoever I want. I am not not definable good for you girl. A woman should be allowed to do whatever she she wants with her body and her patreon is 18 plus. So not just anyone can watch if you want to support her and her Patron head over to patreon.com.
