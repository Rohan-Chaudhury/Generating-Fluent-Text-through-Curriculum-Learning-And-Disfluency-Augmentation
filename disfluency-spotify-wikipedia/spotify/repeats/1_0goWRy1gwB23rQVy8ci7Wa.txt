I'm fine. But just it's weird being sick and trying to recoup recoup its weird. But I'm headed. I'm headed the right way. I'm headed the right direction. I I think so, but yeah, thanks for asking. I'm glad you're on. On the mend mend we did a couple patreon exclusive shows over the weekend or Friday night and you you were sounding a little rough. But at least you know, you stuck it out out for our wonderful patrons absolutely over there, which I know they appreciate so for for this episode or actually before I get started with the episode make sure you're you're following us on our Instagram at Marvel Studios news.
