Hey guys, it's Peter fry and welcome to the living with hope podcast a daily daily devotional where we dig into God's word and explore what it means to live with. Hope Hope in Jesus. Hope that is exactly what Paul is talking about here in 2nd 2nd Corinthians chapter 5. We're going to start this section in verses 1 through through 4 today 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 beginning in verse 1 for we know that if if the tent that is our Earthly home is destroyed. We have a building from from God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this tent tent we groan longing to put on our Heavenly dwelling if indeed by putting it on we we may not be found naked for while we are still in this tent we we groan being burdened not that we would be unclothed but that we would be further.
