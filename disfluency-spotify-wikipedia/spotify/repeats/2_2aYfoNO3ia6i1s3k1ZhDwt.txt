It includes the kids because we really enjoy our time off on on on Saturdays and Sundays as a family and we just got a lotta things that we tend tend tend to do on the weekends. We're busy but Sunday, especially given against towards towards towards the evening as like look kids. Do you have any homework what needs needs needs to be done for tomorrow? Get your clothes out clean your rooms. Let's start start start packing lunches. Etc it's it's just a reminder that we gotta get back to work and and and school tomorrow morning. I like teasing my kids at this time because it's a a a i you guys. I know that school is your favorite. You guys can't can't can't even wait to go back and like know I hate school. I don't don't don't think they really do like I think they like to see their friends. But yeah yeah yeah schools work and their you're not in kindergarten anymore, right?
