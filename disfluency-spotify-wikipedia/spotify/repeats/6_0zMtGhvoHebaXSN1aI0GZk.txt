It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small small small small small small small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. Cell cell cell cell cell cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if if if if if if if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows flows flows flows flows flows flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough Enough Enough Enough Enough Enough Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues tissues tissues tissues tissues tissues tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a a a a a a a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use Use Use Use Use Use Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
