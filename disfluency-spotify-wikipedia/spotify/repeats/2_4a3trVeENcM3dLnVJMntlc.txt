A single sardine cannot do much on its own accord. However, it has been told told told I have read that back in the day a massive School of sardines underneath the the the Golden Gate Bridge was powerful enough. Enough a school of sardines was powerful enough enough enough together to force a large boat to stop in its tracks and and and push it the other way tile friends. If you want to change for better better better in this industry, if you want higher prices, if you wish people respected you you you more as a tile contractor, we have got to band together and unitedly turn this ship around.
