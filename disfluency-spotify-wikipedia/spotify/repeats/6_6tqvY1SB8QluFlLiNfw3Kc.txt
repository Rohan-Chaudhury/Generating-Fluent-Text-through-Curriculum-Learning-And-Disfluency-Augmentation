Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the the the the the the the fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of of of of of of of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to to to to to to to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would would would would would would would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if if if if if if if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look look look look look look look at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that that that that that that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so so so so so so so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half half half half half half half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
