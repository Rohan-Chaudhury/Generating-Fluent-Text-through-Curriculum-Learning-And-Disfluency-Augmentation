We're recording this on on on on on on on on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest digest digest digest digest digest digest digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to to to to to to to to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And And And And And And And And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate reiterate reiterate reiterate reiterate reiterate reiterate reiterate you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are are are are are are are are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just just just just just just just just an example, but they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly swinging your view of a player but we did learn some things some players had had had had had had had had much better showing than others.
