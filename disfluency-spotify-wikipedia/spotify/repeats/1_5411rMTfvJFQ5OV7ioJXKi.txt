Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on on the John Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred hundred twenty seven cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered recovered and in the United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. One. 102 cases confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that that we haven't had any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look look going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
