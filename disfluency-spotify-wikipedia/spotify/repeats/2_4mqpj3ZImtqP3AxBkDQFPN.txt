Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a a a regular Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I I I have had some shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of of of one of which is the fact that I have literally not had a job for for for the past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from from from like a gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother mother mother and my bank account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's that's that's for a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
