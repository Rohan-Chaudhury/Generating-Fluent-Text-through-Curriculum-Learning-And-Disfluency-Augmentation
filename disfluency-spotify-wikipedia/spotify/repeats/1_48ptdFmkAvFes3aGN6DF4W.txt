Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be your host host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to renew renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse is taken from from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and greatest day of of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who is thirsty come come to me and drink when we view the invitation to come to Jesus Through Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
