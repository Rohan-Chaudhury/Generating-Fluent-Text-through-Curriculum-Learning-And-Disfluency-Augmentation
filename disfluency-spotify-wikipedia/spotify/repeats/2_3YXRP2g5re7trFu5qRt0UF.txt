It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that that that you know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have have have a conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're we're we're just here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. Apart apart. So it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you you you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough enough enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to to to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that that that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but but but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
