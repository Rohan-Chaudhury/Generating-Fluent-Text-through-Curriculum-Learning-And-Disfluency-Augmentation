So this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and man. There are some nuggets up up up up up up up up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear it. If this is the first first first first first first first first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going back and listening to part part part part part part part part 1 it's not absolutely imperative.
