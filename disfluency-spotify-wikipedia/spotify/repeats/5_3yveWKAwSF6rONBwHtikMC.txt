Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl girl girl girl girl girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he do you you you you you you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, it's it's it's it's it's it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl duties, duties, duties, duties, duties, duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be in in in in in in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need need need need need need to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is is is is is is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
