Hey everybody, Brayden Chase here. And this is just a quick pause here during our our lesson on English to tell you a little bit about something called anchor anchor is is actually the tool. I am using to produce this podcast for you. So if if you are listening to me right now, it's because of anchor now. What is is anchor anchor is a free free podcast tool that you can use to to create and record and edit. Build your podcast right on your phone or or your computer anchor distributes your podcast for you. So I don't have to track track down apple and Spotify and Google anything it does that all automatically for me. I I just kind of click the button and it goes all by itself. You can can make money from these podcasts right this ad that you're hearing right now now is an ad that I've written for them so that I can make a little little bit of money off of this podcast. That's why it's free, right? right I can give you these things. So if you guys want to make one you can do.
