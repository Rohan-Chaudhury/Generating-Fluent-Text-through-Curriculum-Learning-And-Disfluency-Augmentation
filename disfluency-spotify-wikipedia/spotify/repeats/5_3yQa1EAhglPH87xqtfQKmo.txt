This is is is is is is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality reality reality reality reality reality is you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always always always always always always going to feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're You're You're You're You're You're not always going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going going going going going going to be really great and you're going to be full of passion and feel feel feel feel feel feel inspired. And other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out out out out out out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping chirping chirping chirping chirping chirping in your ear and your life telling you what a stupid idea that you've you've you've you've you've you've embarked on or that business you want to build or that career you want want want want want want to have is just unrealistic for you. So I've got an email here here here here here here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
