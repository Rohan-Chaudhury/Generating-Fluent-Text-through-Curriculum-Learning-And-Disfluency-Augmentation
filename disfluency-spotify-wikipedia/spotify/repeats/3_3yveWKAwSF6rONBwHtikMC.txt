So So So So is he do you find it hard to balance time between all the the the the stuff you do? Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels a-levels a-levels a-levels bought everything else had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you you you you have to learn especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I I I I meant to be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I I I I do need to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up up up up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
