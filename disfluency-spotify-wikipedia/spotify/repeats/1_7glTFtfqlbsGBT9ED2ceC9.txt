Hi and welcome to the fort down podcast. I'm Ben. I'm so and we're we're here to talk about American football. So I go into the NFL after the the demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one with Drew Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and the AFC Championship Game the the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This was the game that you could could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you play that demo. Demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much why you chose to be a a broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a Broncos fan because well quite frankly frankly because I have a horse and I went and I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
