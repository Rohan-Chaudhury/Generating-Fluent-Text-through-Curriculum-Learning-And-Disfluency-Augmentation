So before you decide to listen to me, let let let let let me at least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about about about about about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a nursing nursing nursing nursing nursing home from there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting working at New New New New New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice World, which is is is is is really where I wanted to be I was able to sit with people for for for for for longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were able able able able able to see each other for a bit more than five or ten minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple couple couple couple couple minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point point point point point because they've been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
