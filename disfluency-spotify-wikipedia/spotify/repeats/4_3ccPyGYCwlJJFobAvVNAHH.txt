We need the fact Checkers out there to to to to to correct us, you know, occasionally we do say things that are not correct often speak for for for for for yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the show, but that that that that that just has because we do is almost zero prep. We just kind of come come come come come from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think most of of of of of the time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from from from from from someplace else.
