I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of living with with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived problems and worries going going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. The simple fact that we we all only have one life and that none of us are promised another another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Of our current health health status after all would you seriously stay in the job you hate or the relationship relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your life could end next year. Hell Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you happy and you certainly wouldn't wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this groundbreaking podcast. I interview people people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
