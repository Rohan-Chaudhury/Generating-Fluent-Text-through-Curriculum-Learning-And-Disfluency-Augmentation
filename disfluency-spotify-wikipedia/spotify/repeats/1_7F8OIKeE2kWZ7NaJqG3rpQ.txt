He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to to reinvent religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while while listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I I highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one one of the speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting getting it replaced. So instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is is still enjoyable when it's only coming out of one of the two stereo stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
