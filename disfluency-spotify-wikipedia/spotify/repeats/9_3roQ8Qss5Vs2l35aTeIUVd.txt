Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things things things things things things things things things things well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me me me me me me me me me me that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six six six six six six six six six six of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit sit sit sit sit sit sit sit sit sit on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on on on on on on on on on on it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for for for for for for for for for for sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know know know know know know know know know know they're not supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. It it it it it it it it it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
