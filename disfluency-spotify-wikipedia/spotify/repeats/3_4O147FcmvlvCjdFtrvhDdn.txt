Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if you want want want want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen seen seen seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description and I I I I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going going going going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was was was was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was was was was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be be be be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have have have have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other other other other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments comments comments comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily.
