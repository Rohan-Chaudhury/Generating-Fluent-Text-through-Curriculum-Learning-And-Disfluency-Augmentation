Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic of today's today's today's today's today's today's today's today's today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This is something that I think think think think think think think think think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is you're not going to to to to to to to to to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel like things are are are are are are are are are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's going to to to to to to to to to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling you you you you you you you you you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you want to build build build build build build build build build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for you. So I've I've I've I've I've I've I've I've I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
