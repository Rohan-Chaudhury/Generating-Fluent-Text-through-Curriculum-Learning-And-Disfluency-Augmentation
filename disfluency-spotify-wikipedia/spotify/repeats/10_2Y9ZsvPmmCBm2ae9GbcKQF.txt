I thought you you you you you you you you you you you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you you you you you you you you you you you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded recorded recorded recorded recorded recorded recorded recorded recorded recorded recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme of of of of of of of of of of of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the the the the the the the the the the the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up up up up up up up up up up up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. Adult adult adult adult adult adult adult adult adult adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I finally finally finally finally finally finally finally finally finally finally finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up up up up up up up up up up up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them them them them them them them them them them them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
