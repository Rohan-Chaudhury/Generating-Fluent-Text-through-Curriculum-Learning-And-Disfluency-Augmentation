Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a a a a a a a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the the the the the the the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened listened listened listened listened listened listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower shower shower shower shower shower shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, possible, possible, possible, possible, possible, possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just just just just just just just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand stand stand stand stand stand stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's that's that's that's that's that's that's going to be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen listen listen listen listen listen listen to it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug plug plug plug plug plug plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach your already already already already already already already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or little hit hit hit hit hit hit hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
