I made a mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she put out out out out out out out out out out out and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it that I said said said said said said said said said said said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but You know know know know know know know know know know know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
