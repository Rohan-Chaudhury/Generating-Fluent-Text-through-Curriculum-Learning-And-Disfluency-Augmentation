Perhaps the most deceptively titled episode The Origin of Species was not actually about the the the fucking word genus species. But back to chapter 24 to see what it actually is is is about today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to biology for bastards teaching biology and and and the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John Doe Doe Doe D. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter at at at a time this week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
