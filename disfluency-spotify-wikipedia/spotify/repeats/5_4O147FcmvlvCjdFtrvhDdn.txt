I reported that that that that that that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the the the the the the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was was was was was was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight.
