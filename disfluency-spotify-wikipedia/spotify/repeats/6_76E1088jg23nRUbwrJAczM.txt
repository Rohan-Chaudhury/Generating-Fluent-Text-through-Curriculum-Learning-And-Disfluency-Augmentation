Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining explaining explaining explaining explaining explaining explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine to to to to to to to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an an an an an an an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny Destiny Destiny Destiny Destiny Destiny Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of what they they they they they they they would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is ridiculously important important important important important important important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to become a man of of of of of of of value so that way other men or other people in general can lean on you. You you you you you you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If you don't have have have have have have have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit there and focus focus focus focus focus focus focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very well. Okay, because this this this this this this this video might take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen pen pen pen pen pen pen grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
