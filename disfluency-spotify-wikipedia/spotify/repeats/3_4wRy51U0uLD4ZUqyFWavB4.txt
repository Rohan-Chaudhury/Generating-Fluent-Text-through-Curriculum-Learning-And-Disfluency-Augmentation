We've had a lot of trouble getting this this this this podcast episode set up because my microphone I feel like it's only really good good good good for one person and that I feel like our audio is always a little little little little off and you guys have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it we're probably probably probably probably going to have to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome to yeah, we said it it it it with me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time tuning tuning tuning tuning in. This is a mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice questions that you you you you emailed to me and Miss thing at gmail.com.
