Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had had had had had had had had had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he do do do do do do do do do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl duties, but but but but but but but but but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be in three meetings meetings meetings meetings meetings meetings meetings meetings meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have ways of of of of of of of of of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
