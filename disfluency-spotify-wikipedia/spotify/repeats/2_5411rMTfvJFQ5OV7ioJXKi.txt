Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update update update on the John Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty twenty twenty seven cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the United United United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 cases cases cases confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we haven't haven't haven't had any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look going going going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
