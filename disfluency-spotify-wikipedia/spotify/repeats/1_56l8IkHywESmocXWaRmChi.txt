Hope it gives you perspective to see God is moving moving in your life. Enjoy the message. So thankful that you're here today and and I am going to go ahead I normally have you stand to read read the scripture is 19 verses today. So go ahead and sit down and and we'll take it slow. God bless you. My scripture from today's point of of view is Acts chapter 11. This sermon will probably take two weeks to preach. We did did it last night. The Lord showed up. I thought he did till nobody said there there was here last night. Yeah. To me he showed up. And so we probably won't get to.
