Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are so so so so so so so so so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the the the the the the the the the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the the the the the the the the the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that that that that that that that that that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if technically technically technically technically technically technically technically technically technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at at at at at at at at at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes makes makes makes makes makes makes makes makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on on on on on on on on on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
