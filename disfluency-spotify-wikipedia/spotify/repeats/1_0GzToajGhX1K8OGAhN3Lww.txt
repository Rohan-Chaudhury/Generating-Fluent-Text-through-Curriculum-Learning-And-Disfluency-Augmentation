Welcome to the first ever episode of version final a podcast about where ideas come come from. I'm Ben Pereira and I'm a strategist at cnx. The creative agency accounting accounting Nest. Our aim is to talk to creative people in advertising media publishing technology education education and more the ideation process can be a little bit of a black box box to those of us who aren't designated creatives in organizations. We hope these conversations conversations can shed some light on that as work becomes more D industrialized and more more service-based more and more of us are expected to be creative as part of of our jobs. Our hope is that by talking to people who work daily daily with incorporate constraints and still managed to be consistently creative the rest of us us can learn how to tap into our own creative sides the idea for doing doing a podcast about ideas came from watching how Conde Nast magazine Brands operate cnx and Conde Nast magazine Brands create content for different purposes, but we work pretty.
