Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I guess guess guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that I had had had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little bit the the the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. It is is is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here towards the end end end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 following it it it says this and the evening of that first day of the week when the disciples were were were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood stood stood among them and said peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
