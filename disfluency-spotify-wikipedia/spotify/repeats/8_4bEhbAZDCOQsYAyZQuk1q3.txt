I was on the Midnight Midnight Midnight Midnight Midnight Midnight Midnight Midnight Midnight Express podcast to talk about the woo Kang now we talked for almost two two two two two two two two two and a A half hours just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion discussion discussion discussion discussion discussion discussion discussion discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it where he takes 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours wasn't quite enough but but but but but but but but but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer time and North North North North North North North North North American summer time do not occur at the same time. So I'm like, let's figure out out out out out out out out out a time to record what will be good and I'm like 9:00 p.m. Your time time time time time time time time time sounds good and I work backwards and like I can wake up at that point point point point point point point point point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
