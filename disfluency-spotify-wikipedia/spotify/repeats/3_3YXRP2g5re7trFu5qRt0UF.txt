It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you know, know, know, know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a a a a conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here here here here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's it's it's it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that that that that question, you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it it it it was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful meaningful meaningful meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be be be be totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and and and and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
