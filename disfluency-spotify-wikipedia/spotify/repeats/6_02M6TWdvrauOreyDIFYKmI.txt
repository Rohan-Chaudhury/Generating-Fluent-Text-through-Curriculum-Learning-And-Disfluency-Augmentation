Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly weekly weekly weekly weekly weekly weekly weekly podcast and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as as as as as as as so far and want to touch another thing that I did last week. Week week week week week week. I made a mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about about about about about about about the meme she put out and about be kind and I notice when I listen listen listen listen listen listen listen back to it that I said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a a a a a a a big difference, but You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted wanted wanted wanted wanted wanted wanted to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
