Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on Vale. I I was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder song as as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And all it did for me was was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me of all time, which which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, first of all when you you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got to go. Um, man, I've I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's my favorite favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on on it. Is that Love's in Need of Love today? We need to give the the love back to ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted to to get you to consider that you can apply this to lots of things in your your life and fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
