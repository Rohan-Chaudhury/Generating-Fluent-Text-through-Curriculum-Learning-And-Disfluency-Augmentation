Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become become become become become become become become so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is is is is is is is is a fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she she she she she she she she came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the World perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do which which which which which which which which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea of ableism and and and and and and and and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as opposed to to to to to to to to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. It was so so so so so so so so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting conversation. I really hope you you you you you you you you enjoy it as always.
