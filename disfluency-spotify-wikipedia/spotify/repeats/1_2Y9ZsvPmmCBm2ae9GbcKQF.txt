Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope Hope you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode episode starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of of this podcast is called catch open me at the time that I I started this podcast. I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about about random stuff, you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then then as I recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to to figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of of the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health health growing up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. Adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. Up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So So basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
