Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, well, well, well, well, well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers bothers bothers bothers bothers bothers me that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of of of of of of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit sit sit sit sit sit on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump jump jump jump jump jump on it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on on on on on on it. It's for sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they they they they they they know they're not supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little little little little little little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a a a a a a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
