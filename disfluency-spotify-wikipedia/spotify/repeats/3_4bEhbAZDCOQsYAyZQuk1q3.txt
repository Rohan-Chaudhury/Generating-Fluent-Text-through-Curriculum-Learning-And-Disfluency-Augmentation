So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I I I I am joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream dream dream dream speakers in another episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I thought thought thought thought it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I am am am am doing fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the woo woo woo woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about about about about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take take take take it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two two two two hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian Australian Australian Australian summer time and North American summer time do not occur at the same time. Time time time. So I'm like, let's figure out a time to record what will be good and and and and I'm like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like like like like I can wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
