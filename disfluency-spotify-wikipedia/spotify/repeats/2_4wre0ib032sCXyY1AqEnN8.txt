Actually, it's quite quite quite the opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to to to continue to grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a a a reminder that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when our our our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
