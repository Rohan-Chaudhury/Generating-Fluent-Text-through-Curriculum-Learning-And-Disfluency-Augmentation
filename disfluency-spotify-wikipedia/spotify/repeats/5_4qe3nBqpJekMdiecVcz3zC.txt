Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the the the the the the topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What What What What What What kind of interesting email here from a guy who writes in thanking me me me me me me for my work and telling me how just in a short period of of of of of of time. He's in a situation where I guess his he's been married. And he's he's he's he's he's he's in the process of getting a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks ago. He found out she was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. Apparently apparently apparently apparently apparently. So the interesting thing is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward forward forward forward forward forward with the divorce, but the interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up up up up up up with his wife without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
