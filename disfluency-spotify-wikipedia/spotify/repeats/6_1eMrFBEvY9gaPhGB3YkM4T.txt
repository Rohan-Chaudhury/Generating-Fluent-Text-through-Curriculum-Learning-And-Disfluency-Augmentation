Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very very very very very very very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of of of of of of of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And And And And And And And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use use use use use use use the small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the the the the the the the lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than than than than than than than traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. Shift shift shift shift shift shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in in in in in in in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
