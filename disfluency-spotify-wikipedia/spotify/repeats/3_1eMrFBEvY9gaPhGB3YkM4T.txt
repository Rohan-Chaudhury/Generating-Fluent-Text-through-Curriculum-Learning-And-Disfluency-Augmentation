Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was was was was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism organism organism organism right in front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading reading reading reading the rules again. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use use use use the small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to to to to fix the lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other other other other than traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great great great great shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement movement movement movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
