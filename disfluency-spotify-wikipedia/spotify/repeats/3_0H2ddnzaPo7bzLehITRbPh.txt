I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of of of of living with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived perceived perceived perceived problems and worries going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. Embracing embracing embracing. The simple fact that we all only have one life and that none of us us us us are promised another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Regardless regardless regardless. Of our current health status after all would you seriously stay in the job job job job you hate or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your your your your life could end next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you you you you happy and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in in in in this groundbreaking podcast. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
