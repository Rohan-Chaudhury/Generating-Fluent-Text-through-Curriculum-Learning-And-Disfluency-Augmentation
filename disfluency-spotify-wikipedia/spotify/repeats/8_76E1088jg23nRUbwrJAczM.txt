Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be be be be be be be be be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more more more more more more more more more masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is is is is is is is is is such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their their their their their their their their their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of of of of of of of of of what they would like and as a man this is important to your your your your your your your your your success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to to to to to to to to to become a man of value so that way other men or other people in in in in in in in in in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's here's here's here's here's here's here's here's here's the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person person person person person person person person person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to to to to to to to to to do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five five five five five five five five five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
