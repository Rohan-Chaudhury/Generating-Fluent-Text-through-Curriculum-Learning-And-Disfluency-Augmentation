What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to to to to to to to to to to talk about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode mode mode mode mode mode mode mode mode mode Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really really really really really really really really really really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on on on on on on on on on on this shout out to the third row podcast. I came up the the the the the the the the the the idea for this episode. We were just recording and we're talking about this new new new new new new new new new new track package that came out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where where where where where where where where where where you can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your your your your your your your your your your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a a a a a a a a a a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to to to to to to to to to to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity opportunity opportunity opportunity opportunity opportunity opportunity opportunity opportunity opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would would would would would would would would would would love and the track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
