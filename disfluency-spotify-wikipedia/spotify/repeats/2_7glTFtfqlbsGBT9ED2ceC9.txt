So I go into the NFL after the the the demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was the one with with with Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and and and the AFC Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the jets. Jets Jets. This was the game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo demo demo and so you play that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much why why why you chose to be a broadcaster?
