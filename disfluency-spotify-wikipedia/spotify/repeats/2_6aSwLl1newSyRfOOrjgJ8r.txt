Hi, I'm world-famous actor / Entertainer Kevin Bacon after putting my career career career first for three decades. I've isolated myself that for what what's the point of of of being six degrees from everyone if all you really want is a best friend. Well, Well, Well, I have finally found someone. I have a true bond with Randy best best best low. I don't think anyone could ever ruin our friendship. I ran deepest deepest deepest low. We'll kill Kevin Bacon. He stole what should have been my life life life previously on the last degree of Kevin Bacon. This wasn't the Kevin Bacon. I'd imagine killing killing killing for all those years. He was just some boring guy Rani gave me me me the right sir, Frog and Toad Kevin. Somehow made this it would take his career kevin. Kevin Kevin. You have to make this movie Jeff. I need you to go to the Staples Center and pick up the U-Haul. I left there something.
