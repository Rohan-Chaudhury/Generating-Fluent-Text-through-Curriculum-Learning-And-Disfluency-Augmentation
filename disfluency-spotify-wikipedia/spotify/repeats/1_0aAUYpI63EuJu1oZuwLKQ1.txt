Movers Netter just talking to teachers talking to teachers about academic research and evidence-based practice practice with continuing professional development at PNA 1977 on Twitter is Netter. Just talking to to teachers welcome to this week's Dale is NASA in association with the teacher development trusts and now now proudly sponsored by John Kat educational. So we have a strip Back Lean podcast podcast this week. So there is no teacher development trusts section or the usual podcast podcast pedagogy section where it's me and Rings into music film and books. They will will return next week. So it's just stripped back to feature me and the wonderful ormer ormer Akbar in conversation. And the reason for this strict back podcast is that that I'm recording especially early in the week this week because I have just been been recording a couple of Epic podcast. So as I'm speaking to you now have literally just got off the phone to Daisy Krista.
