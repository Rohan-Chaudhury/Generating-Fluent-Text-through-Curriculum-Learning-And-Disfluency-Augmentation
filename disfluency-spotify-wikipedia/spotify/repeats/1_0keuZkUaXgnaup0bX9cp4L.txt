Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become so taboo? taboo So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a fitness influencer influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she came came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the World World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do which which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea of ableism and and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as opposed to those of of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. It was so inspiring to people people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting conversation. I really hope you enjoy it it as always. Please do rate review And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
