Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you you you you you you you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire entire entire entire entire entire entire life. That there's something wrong with this world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you crazy.
