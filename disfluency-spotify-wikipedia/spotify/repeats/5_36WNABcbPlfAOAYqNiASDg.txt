I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to to to to to to you saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind kind kind kind kind kind of have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your your your your your your own words. And so okay.

And what we've noticed noticed noticed noticed noticed noticed about any who for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing allowing allowing allowing allowing allowing their alignment with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the the the the the the well-being that is so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
