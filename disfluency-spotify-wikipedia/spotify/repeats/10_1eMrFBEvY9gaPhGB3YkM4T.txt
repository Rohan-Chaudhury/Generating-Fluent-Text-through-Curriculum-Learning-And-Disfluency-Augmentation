And again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on the table table table table table table table table table table table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I also also also also also also also also also also also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't do do do do do do do do do do do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first thing I tried tried tried tried tried tried tried tried tried tried tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer closer closer closer closer closer closer closer closer closer closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
