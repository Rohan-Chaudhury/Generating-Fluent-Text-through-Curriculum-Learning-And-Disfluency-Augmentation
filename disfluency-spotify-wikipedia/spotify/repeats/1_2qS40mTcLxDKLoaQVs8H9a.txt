They are the excellent ones in whom is all my my delight their sorrows shall be multiplied that exchange the Lord for another God God their drink offerings of blood. I will not offer nor take their names upon upon my lips. The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup cup Dow maintains my lat the Lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places. Yea, I have have a goodly Heritage. I Will Bless The Lord who has given me counsel. Yay. My reins instruct me in the night Seasons. I have set the lord.
