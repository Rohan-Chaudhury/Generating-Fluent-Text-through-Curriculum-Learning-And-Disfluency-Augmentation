Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in in one place like suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven heaven so and filled the whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be tongues like tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All uh All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began. To speak in in other okay tongues as the spirit enabled them. Now there was staying in Jerusalem God-fearing God-fearing Jews from um every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment.
