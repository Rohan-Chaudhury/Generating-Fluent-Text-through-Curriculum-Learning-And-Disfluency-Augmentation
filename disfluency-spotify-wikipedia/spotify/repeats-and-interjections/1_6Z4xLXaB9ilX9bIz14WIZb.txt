Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were were so doing it in a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. 1805. The men you know of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the the banks um of the Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day day uh of traveling the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder intruder uh was in their midst. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into um Camp Camp lured by bison meat that had been hung up to dry. If it decided like it it wanted to snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it well unaware of the the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
