It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you well know, you you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have like a conversation. Conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're okay just here to to serve each other to get this money and then we walking like apart. So it's it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that well question, you know know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't uh think it was enough enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't okay enjoying each other. Meaningful ways ways to make you know, a lot of us like joke the Twitter can be totally useless useless that it's just a bunch of um idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
