Hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised I mean a bear bear and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. So. We are going going to take you on a journey blank to the Future uh and before you and ask ask where we are going. You don't need green arrows uh and that's a good thing because because you're not going to get them here uh at least not in this episode kind kind of a topsy-turvy week that saw well several Blast from the Past tear up the the usual FPL narratives and well cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s film references references and of course I'm uh talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace which Drew Drew assisted one. I okay believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he he could be considered you know a precursor to America's Alonso. And of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before we get into this any.
