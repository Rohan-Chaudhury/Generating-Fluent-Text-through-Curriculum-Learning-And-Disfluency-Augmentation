Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the okay topic of of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in well life. This is something that that I think pretty much every man struggles with I mean because the reality is you're not not going to stay positive all the time. So. You're not always going to feel like like things are going to work out well in your favor. You're not always going to feel feel like you're doing the right okay thing someday is going to be really great great and you're going to be full I mean of passion and feel inspired. And And other days it's going to feel hopeless and so like things aren't working out and you're you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if well you got people chirping in your ear and and your life telling you what a okay stupid idea that you've embarked on or or that business you want to build so or that career you want to have is is just unrealistic for you. So okay I've got an email here from a guy who who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
