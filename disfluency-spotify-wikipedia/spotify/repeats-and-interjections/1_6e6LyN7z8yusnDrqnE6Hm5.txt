I'm going well to talk about about giving up Perfection or this idea of perfection for progress. And for well peace. I think think I think that it's it's where we find peace when okay we accept that. We are are imperfect like Just it's The Human Condition. I want you to so know that that every single person on planet Earth is not getting it. All right, I mean they may may look like they're getting it right because there's maybe one facet I mean of of their life that they're really focused on and really paying a lot well of attention to but but I'm gonna guarantee like seriously, I'm gonna guarantee like that there's other parts of their lives that are sacrificing because of it, right I look at life now is.
