So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one of um I mean so okay um um like my mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's favorite. So I think it was well um uh so so okay so one of the first ones she saw in in in in in in um so I mean okay um so like in in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I you know so um so um I mean um was about about about about about about about about nine or ten, which given like I mean so you know like I mean okay the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. But I I I I I mean so uh so you know well uh I I I I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that okay well okay I mean well so like so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
