Mental retardation Gene and that is fmr1 on I mean uh I mean uh well uh like so so the long long long long long long long long long long arm of um so like okay so you know I mean well um the X chromosome and this leads to hyper methylation and inactivation of of of um um so uh uh like uh um well of of of of of of of fmr1. So remember these cgg trinucleotide like like I mean you know like um I mean I mean so repeats fragile X mental retardation fmr1 gene on the long arm. Leading to hypermethylation and.
