Yes. Hi. I am calling this number because I saw it on okay a bathroom bathroom wall. See if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is like going to to hell and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have Adam so Breeze of of Raven I with us but before we hop into that, I um just wanted to go go over I sold myself short on the last I mean episode about my romantic capabilities. Capabilities. I think I came up on the last. Episode saying like that I don't remember what what I got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I I mean write thoughtful cards out, out, but I personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because uh I got him a heart-shaped heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves you know cheesecake and I also got him Star Wars Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
