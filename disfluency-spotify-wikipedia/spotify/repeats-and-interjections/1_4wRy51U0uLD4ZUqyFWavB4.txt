Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I am too but I'm I'm trying to pretend okay I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this this podcast episode set well up because my microphone I feel like it's only really really good well for one person and that I feel like our audio is always always a little off I mean and you guys have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot troubleshoot it we're so probably going to have to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome welcome to yeah, um we said it with me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time um time tuning in. This is a mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice questions like questions that you emailed to me and Miss thing at gmail.com. And I would say say I mean it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
