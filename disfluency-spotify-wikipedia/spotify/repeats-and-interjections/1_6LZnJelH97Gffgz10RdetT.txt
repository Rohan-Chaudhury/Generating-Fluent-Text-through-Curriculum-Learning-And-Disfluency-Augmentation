But first of all, I'd like okay to introduce introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm so a board board certified Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see like you about 40 50 50 patients a day and the office I'll still go to so the hospital and usually usually have a census. It's been 5 to 15 patients, well including ICU and critical heal heal patients. So literally my patients have you know been very worried about the core virus virus and to be honest who is like not been worried about this. Okay? And therefore I've had multiple questions regarding, you know, what what what they can do to protect.
