I'm a colorist for film television I mean like television television and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading I mean so sweet to to to work on their projects. They sit on this color couch like you know of mine for an hour a a a day or weeks on end depending on the so okay project those clients might be directors directors directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending you know uh on the project now our work. On On On the project we talked about a so like whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but but but not necessarily and like uh that is what the color couch is all about. It's a a a glimpse well you know behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from like you know from from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
