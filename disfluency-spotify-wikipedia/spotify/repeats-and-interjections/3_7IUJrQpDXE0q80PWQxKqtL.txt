We know that we need the wisdom you know I mean uh of a mentor to help help help help us focus on what matters and avoid well okay okay costly mistakes yet, too often finding that that that that person. We trust and well okay okay whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do find find find find them like you know so then on the other side of the world or is too expensive or they just uh uh okay just just just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for like okay well over 30 years in in in in a one-on-one basis and at the uh you know well start of this year. I've been thinking a lot lot lot lot about how like well uh I can mentor more people how I can help more people. So I have have like well uh have have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be able like I mean um to to to to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can um I mean well ask me questions anything you you you you like whatever you are in the world for so so well a fraction of the cost that that that that this would be in.
