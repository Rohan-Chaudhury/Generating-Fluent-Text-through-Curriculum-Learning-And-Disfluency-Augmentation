Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things things I mean well things well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that okay uh the kids kids kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's like uh six of us in in in this household and this couch is uh so falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch not walk walk walk well um on it not run on it now jump on it and dance on like you know it. It it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. So well I mean when you you you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed you know you know to but they just can't can't can't help themselves, but do a little skipper. Well um. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch catch catch them, I have a tendency to like uh overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
