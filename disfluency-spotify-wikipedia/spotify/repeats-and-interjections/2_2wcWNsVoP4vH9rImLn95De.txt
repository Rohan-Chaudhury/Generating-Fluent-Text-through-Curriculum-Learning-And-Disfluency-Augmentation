So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, yes, I mean well yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach coach um uh coach because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard like you know hard hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall um uh into this pattern pattern pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. I mean like. A way, which I I I know better than to do but I just you know I mean kind of got caught in a loop loop loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so um so my coach said something to to to me so very profound and the shift well um that it has created since then has been been been so powerful that he um okay just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
