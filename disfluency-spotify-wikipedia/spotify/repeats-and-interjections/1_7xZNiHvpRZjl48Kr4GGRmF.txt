Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and so shay. Shay. I have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about you know before we we talk about like life. So last episode we both talked about how um we were reading the the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My you know question is no spoilers. We don't have to say say anything in you know case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell me if you well you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back home okay - - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. I uh even even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just to see if uh people people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when so I read this but that bad bad it's not that bad. I went to like his Instagram because I don't know in my my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
