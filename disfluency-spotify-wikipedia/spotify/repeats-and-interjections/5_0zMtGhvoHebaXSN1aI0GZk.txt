It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a a I mean so so I mean um a a a a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The well you know okay I mean I mean energy needed by every every every every every every living cell. If there is not you know um you know well well enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough enough enough enough enough enough energy if okay um okay so like blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on on on you know uh um like um on on on osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients um okay uh like uh as as as as as as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can you know like well um so detect if there is a high concentration. Concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration. Enough blood glucose you know like you know I mean so if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases releases releases releases like so like like okay releases releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect so okay I mean well you know the presence presence presence presence presence presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose into uh like like uh well glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose that is well I mean well um um insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues continues continues okay um I mean well uh continues continues continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
