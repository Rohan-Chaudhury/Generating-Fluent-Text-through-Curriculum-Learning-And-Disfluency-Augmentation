July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 42 year old so came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Juanita you know Lopez over dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun sun setting well over San Jose the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as uh as idyllic as it seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected uh himself with with Heroin just like most nights but right away something felt like different. It was all wrong. Wrong. The drugs burned hot through his veins unlike you know anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to to hallucinate and eventually passed out into I mean a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
