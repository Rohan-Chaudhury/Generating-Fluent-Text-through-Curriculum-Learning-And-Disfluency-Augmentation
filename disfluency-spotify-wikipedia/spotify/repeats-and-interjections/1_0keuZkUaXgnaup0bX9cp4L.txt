Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become so well so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is like is a fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and like and how she came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the um the way that the World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that well that were born with may do which might seem like a confusing like concept. Act but it's basically basically the idea of ableism and how the world is set so up for people who are are able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't um function in a very specific specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, like and I think it's a really interesting interesting conversation. I really hope you enjoy it so as always. Please do rate review And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
