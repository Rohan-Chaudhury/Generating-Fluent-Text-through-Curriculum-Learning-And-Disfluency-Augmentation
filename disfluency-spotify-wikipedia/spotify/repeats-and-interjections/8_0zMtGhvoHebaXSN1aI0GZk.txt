It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small range so I mean so like okay well I mean okay range range range range range range range range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases like uh okay like like well I mean okay The energy needed by every living cell. If If If If If If If If you know um you know I mean uh well okay well If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose um okay I mean so you know uh like I mean levels are are are are are are are are are too high. This can you know so you know well okay uh um well have a negative impact on osmosis, which is the movement of of of of of of of okay I mean uh well so well well so of of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. Like okay you know so so I mean uh um. The body body body body body body body body body can detect if there you know uh um uh um well uh you know is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of of of you know okay like uh like I mean um okay of of of of of of blood glucose is too high the pancreas um so well like um okay I mean I mean releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the the the the the the so okay uh like I mean you know you know like the the the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert well you know okay you know so I mean um um the excess glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose into glycogen glycogen you know you know you know so like well okay okay as a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored stored stored uh um like um well okay you know uh stored stored stored stored stored stored for later. Use this process continues until the um um uh like like okay I mean well pancreas detects a normal blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood blood glucose okay okay like I mean uh okay so well concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
