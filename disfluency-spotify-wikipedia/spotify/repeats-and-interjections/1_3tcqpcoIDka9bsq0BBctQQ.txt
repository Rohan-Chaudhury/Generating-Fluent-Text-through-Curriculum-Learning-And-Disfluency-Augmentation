And uh anyway, this is is just what I'm feeling and I know it'll pass at some I mean point and movement movement really seems to make all the difference which I think is okay so cool. Cool. Hello, everybody today. We are joined by Jenna and she's one of well my clients and and she's actually turned into a quite a dear friend of mine I mean during our time together. Together. And so today we are going to be having like a conversation about her journey that that led up to her and I working together where like she's at. Now what she she likes about our time together things that you can't well stand also perhaps we'll see see where it goes. But the goal of today is to highlight her journey in the hopes of connecting.
