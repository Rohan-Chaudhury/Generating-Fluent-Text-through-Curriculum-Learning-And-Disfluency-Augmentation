I I I think I'm good at that or the time well you know actually good at that so I have have have been challenged this week and And okay uh it's hard. It's hard pushing yourself through through through those challenges. It feels uncomfortable you I mean like get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and you you you your instinct says right. I so you know need to move away from this. I don't want to to to go there I mean I mean t harv Eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets gets gets easy like uh when you do the hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard stuff. Well okay. Stuff stuff. So something is really challenging you at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
