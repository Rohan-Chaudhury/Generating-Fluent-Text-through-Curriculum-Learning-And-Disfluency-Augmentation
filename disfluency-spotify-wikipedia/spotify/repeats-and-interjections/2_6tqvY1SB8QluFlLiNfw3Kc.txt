Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires you know uh are are are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first like I mean place of the the the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in I mean so first place due to the tiebreak, tiebreak, tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Like so. Is it the tiebreaker because that would make make make the most sense, but so like of course not listen, I don't care if technically they're not in in in first. Okay uh. All I care about is when you look at the points it is is okay well is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the situation uh okay we are are are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So okay so the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes Hurricanes Hurricanes four to one on a so like second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
