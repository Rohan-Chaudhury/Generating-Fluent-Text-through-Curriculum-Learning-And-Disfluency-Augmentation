He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other um I mean well other other other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and so well you know order to reinvent religion for for for for myself. Okay story time. I was driving like you know okay to visit a friend while listening listening listening listening to to the excellent well okay I mean album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I highly highly highly highly recommend for like uh um fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the speakers in you know well um in in in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it I mean you know well replaced. So instead of of of of Music I've had to listen to stuff so well you know that is still enjoyable when it's only coming coming coming coming out of one of I mean I mean okay the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
