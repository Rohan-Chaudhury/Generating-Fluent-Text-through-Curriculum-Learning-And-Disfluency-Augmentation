You're not always going to feel like you're doing um um um I mean the right thing someday is is is is is going to be really so well well so great and you're going to be full of passion and and and and and feel um um well you know inspired. And other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't aren't aren't so okay um well aren't aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you you so well um uh you you you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling you okay I mean so like what a stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business well so I mean uh you want to build or that that that that that career you want to I mean um like so have is just unrealistic for you.
