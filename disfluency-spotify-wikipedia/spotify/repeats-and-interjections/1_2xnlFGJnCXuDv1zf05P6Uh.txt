What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about like about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model well Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really like really really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on um this shout out out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea uh for this episode. Episode. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package well that came out for for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you uh can basically get these these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance so model 3 which already cost 60 60 Grand and then you pay five and a so half Grand more for these these new tires and these brake pads which are geared so to make it perform better on on the track. It's gotten some awesome you know reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And And I was just thinking like wow, there's so like much opportunity for Tesla as sort sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell uh all of these fancy new features and services services that sort of Die you know Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and and the track package is one example, like but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
