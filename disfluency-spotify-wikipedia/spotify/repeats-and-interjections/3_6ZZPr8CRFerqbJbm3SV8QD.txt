Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting grunting well well so grunting grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree you know okay you know tree tree tree of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching okay um I mean me. And I I I I calm and you fall to your uh okay so knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds sounds sounds sounds of making love my you know uh well breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath Breath Breath Breath um okay um of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high so well so higher higher higher higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
