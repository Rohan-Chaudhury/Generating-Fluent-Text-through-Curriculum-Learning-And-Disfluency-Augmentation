Ain't like you know so there was was was was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that I mean well I mean came from growing up between between between between worlds and of the push and pull well uh uh of the happy and the hard then I went went went went to so like I mean a school for missionaries kids in Germany when I was in ninth grade, and and um uh you know and and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite well I mean uh been able able able able to put a finger on we're not just in like I mean um me my friends at Black Black Black Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
