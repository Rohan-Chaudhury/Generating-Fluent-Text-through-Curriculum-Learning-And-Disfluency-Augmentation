Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one so I mean um one one one place suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came okay okay you know from from from from heaven and filled the whole house where they were um you know okay sitting they saw what seemed to to to to be tongues of fire so so well that separated and came to rest on each of them. All All All All uh you know so of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began. To speak in other tongues tongues tongues like so so tongues as the spirit enabled them. Now there was staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment.
