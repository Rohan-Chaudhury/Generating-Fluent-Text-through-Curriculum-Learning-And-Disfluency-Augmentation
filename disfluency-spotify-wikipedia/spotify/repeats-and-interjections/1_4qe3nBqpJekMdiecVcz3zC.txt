What kind of okay interesting interesting email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my um work and telling telling me how just in a short period of time. He's um in a situation where where I guess his he's been married. And he's in the so process of getting a a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. So. He found out she she was having an emotional affair with some other guy uh apparently. So the interesting thing thing is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving I mean forward with the divorce, but the interesting interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and you know hooking up with his wife wife without any kind of attachments or worried about what you know may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
