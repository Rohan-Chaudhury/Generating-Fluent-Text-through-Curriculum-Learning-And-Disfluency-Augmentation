Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or well or try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that um going going on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind well this podcast podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being you know real being being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite I mean the opposite. Opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to you know continue to grow grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to I mean serve as a reminder that that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see uh the way out when our backs backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
