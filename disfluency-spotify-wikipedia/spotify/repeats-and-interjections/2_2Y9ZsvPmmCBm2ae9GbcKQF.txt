I thought thought thought you know, what like catching up well well with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you you you know catch up with me sounds like like well a good title. But then as I recorded the the the past few episodes, I've I mean you know noticed something I started to figure out what the the the theme of this like um podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the the the you know uh things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health you know you know growing up up up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young you know you know adult. Adult adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be like okay basically growing up. Up up. I finally figure out what the theme of this so I mean podcast should be. So basically growing growing growing up is going to be having okay um guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having having having them share what they um like think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
