Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for for our so first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old old school you know one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one one uh of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first you know first ones she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this um movie movie when I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and okay violence seems wildly wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling so yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
