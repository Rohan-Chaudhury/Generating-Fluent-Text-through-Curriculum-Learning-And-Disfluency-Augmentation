Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking fucking week late. Well. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I I came to uh New Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a a so lot of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days after after so but I had so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to um to go get my pap. Smear I have errands to run I was well linking with with people that I see in a while. Basically, I really didn't uh have time and then then I'm staying in New Orleans and my mom house so and then my brother's over here here and nephews and it be loud like I'm so finally recording because now I'm finally finally in my house and no one's here right so now, which is kind of rare. Rare. So I'm trying to record before somebody try to uh come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
