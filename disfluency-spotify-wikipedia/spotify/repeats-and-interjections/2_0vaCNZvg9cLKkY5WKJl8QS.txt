Hey everybody. Welcome to Mom Hood, it's Wednesday. We're so glad that you're here. Okay um. I I I hope you guys are having a beautiful week. We are stoked because today well okay is part part part 2 of the October Gonzalez interview and we have been um um absolutely dying to release this this this one. So this episode focuses all on well I mean marriage and motherhood and man. There are some some some nuggets up in here. I okay like can't wait for you guys to hear it. If this this this is the first one like so that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going back and and and listening to part 1 um uh it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think that all of the the the information I mean okay in part to her story all her tips the way that she parents it's it's I mean so it's all like so much more interesting and almost more like valuable when uh I mean you know where where where she came from part 1 is all about her you know like life as a young girl girl girl how she was parented her family story um like Dynamic her as a young woman and and and it's fascinating and it makes her um I mean marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
