I forget forget forget forget the choreography and I don't even think about you know so I mean it being a workout. I just just just just listened to the songs and okay so like I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm I'm I'm I'm I mean um so in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training well well well training training training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times well okay um as possible, but but but but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all you know I mean so the work out. It's It's It's It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will uh you know I mean pop up or lyrics or stand out out out out all these musical landmarks um like you know will come up and you don't know what that's going to to to to I mean uh you know be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen I mean I mean you know to it it it it for a while and then when you actually then I mean well um go right let's plug in in in in and learn the choreography when I mean um you know those two things come together and you teach your already already already already naturally in I mean um uh the music.
