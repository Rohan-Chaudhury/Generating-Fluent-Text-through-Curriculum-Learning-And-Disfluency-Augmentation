Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl you know like Izzie Izzie Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So well well is he do you find it it it hard to balance time between all the I mean so stuff you do? Yes, it's very tricky tricky tricky to balance my time between the a-levels I mean so bought everything else had girl duties, but it's it's it's such an essential skill. That so so you have to learn especially when doing gcses and and and a-levels. So I have um you know some days where I meant to be in three meetings at at at once you know um which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have ways of getting around you know um around around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
