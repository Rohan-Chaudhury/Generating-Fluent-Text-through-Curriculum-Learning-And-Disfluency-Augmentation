July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 I mean uh year year year old came home from a long day at work and kissed his I mean like girlfriend Juanita Lopez Lopez Lopez over dinner. He glanced out a window to watch I mean okay the Summer sun setting over San San San Jose the largest city in I mean you know Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it it it seemed after uh so dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin Heroin Heroin just like like uh most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. Okay I mean. The drugs burned burned burned hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before I mean um he began to hallucinate hallucinate hallucinate and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
