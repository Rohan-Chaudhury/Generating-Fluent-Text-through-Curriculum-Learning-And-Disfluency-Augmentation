Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. So. I guess guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday I mean that that I had a a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it so out a little bit bit the day up. But for the most part very few um things surprise me. It is is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. So. Have felt here towards the end end of chapter 20 and the Book of John like starting in verse 19 following it says this and and the evening of that first uh day of the week when the disciples were together together with the doors locked okay for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and and said okay peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
