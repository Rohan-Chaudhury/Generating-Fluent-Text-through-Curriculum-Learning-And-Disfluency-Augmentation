Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree and I I um became good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal State I mean Long Long Beach Bree was actually taken the course because she was preparing to apply okay to occupational therapy therapy school. She has recently been admitted and we are so proud uh of her Bree also also has a background in kinesiology, which is what she studied like for her undergraduate major major and when she was still studying that she also you know played basketball NCAA Division II at at Cal State East Bay. So this woman has a well lot of knowledge about not only only how to exercise but also how to exercise like confidence. We're going to dive dive into some of the ways in which she's faced some I mean really tough situations and and she's had to pull out that inner strength to keep you know going in the face face of some situations where she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
