So we just got a letter so for you here, we like wanted to talk about about a few things that we've been stumbling upon over the last uh few days since since the finale and couple things we want to talk about I mean before the reunions show just just in case that It gets wild and we don't want to I mean you know, take up up too much time in the podcast after that. So uh we're yeah, the internet internet is swirling with post interviews and insights into the show. Well. And I think now now that they can be open and doing you know, like you definitely see certain couples couples out there on the interview circuit and like making appearances. And so we just want to talk talk about what we found um out since the show and how we feel about it going into reunions and second seasons and spin-off and really we're looking for.
