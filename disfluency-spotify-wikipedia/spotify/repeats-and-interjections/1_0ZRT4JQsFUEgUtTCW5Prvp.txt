What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge I mean Ford in in London, Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is Thursday, well Thursday, March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little I mean little pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after after the so Leafs loss in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in in a row so prior The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but but like you have to sort of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won um three three games in. Road that we're key games against teams that were at I mean least on on par with them Florida a few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead um of them them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver who was battling for uh a playoff spot in the the Western Conference. They come up against the okay team and they play three teams on this west west coast swing that are well out of it that are basically, you know, playing out the the string and they got like outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
