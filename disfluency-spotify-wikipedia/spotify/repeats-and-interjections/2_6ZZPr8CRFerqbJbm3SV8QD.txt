Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you you you well so grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the the I mean uh the tree of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And like you know I I I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans um okay and groans the sounds of making making making love my breath is a fucking that okay I mean you're not forget. Your breath the the the Breath of Life kissing my lips. Okay I mean. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high high high higher than the mountains like I mean kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
