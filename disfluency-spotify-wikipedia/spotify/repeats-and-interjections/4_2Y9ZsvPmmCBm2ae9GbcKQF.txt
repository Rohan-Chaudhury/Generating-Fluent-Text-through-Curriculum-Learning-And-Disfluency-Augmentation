I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. You know so well I mean. Just talking about about about about about random stuff, you know catch up with me you know you know okay so sounds like a good title. But then then then then then as I recorded well you know like well the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what what what like uh uh um what what the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know I mean well um so notice a a a a a lot of the things that we covered from so you know you know well the past few episode is about about about about about mental health growing up and things we well so okay well deal with as a teenager or as a a a a a young adult. So you know uh uh I mean with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically basically basically basically um uh um um basically growing up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should should like uh like so should should should be. So basically growing up is going to be having okay uh uh uh guess hopping onto the podcast and and and and and basically having them okay I mean well um share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
