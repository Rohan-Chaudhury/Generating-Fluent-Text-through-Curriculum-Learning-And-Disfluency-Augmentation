So is he do you you you you you find it hard to balance you know um so like time between all the stuff you do? Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, it's um you know so um very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl girl girl I mean um so uh girl girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially I mean okay okay well when doing gcses gcses gcses gcses gcses and a-levels. So I have some like you know uh like days where I meant to be in three three three three three meetings at well well okay um once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have ways ways ways you know uh okay uh ways ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
