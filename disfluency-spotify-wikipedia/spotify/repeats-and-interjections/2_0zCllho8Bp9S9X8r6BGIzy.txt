But yeah, so sorry about that long break I mean you know we took we were just really really really busy with midterms papers. We went um you know on a Hiatus we just were busy. Yeah. Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, not a Hiatus. That means we're like temporarily broken up. It's a short break. Okay spotty spotty neck.
