Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires uh okay like well fires fires fires fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals you know so um I mean in first place of of of of of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the you know you know you know I mean Caps are still in first place due to to to to to the tiebreak, which um okay um I mean is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that that I mean uh okay well that that that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I mean like um like I don't care care care care care if technically they're not in first. All I care you know I mean like so about is when you look at the the the the the points it is you know like you know um tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the the well well you know like the the the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so you know I mean so um happy. So the Flyers Flyers Flyers Flyers Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one okay so I mean well on a second half of a back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
