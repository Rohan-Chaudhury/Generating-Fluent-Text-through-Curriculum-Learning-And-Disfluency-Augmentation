It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a well so okay um small range range range range range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases well uh um uh The energy needed by every living cell. If If If If If there is like you know uh I mean not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood blood blood you know okay I mean okay blood blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, I mean okay uh like which is is is is is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration um like well like gradients as blood flows through the the the the the pancreas. The body can detect if um I mean so okay there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose glucose glucose glucose glucose if the concentration like you know uh um of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin insulin okay I mean okay well insulin insulin insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence uh you know uh you know of insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as uh like um okay a form of glucose that is is is is is insoluble and can be stored you know well well you know for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects detects detects detects detects I mean well so well a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
