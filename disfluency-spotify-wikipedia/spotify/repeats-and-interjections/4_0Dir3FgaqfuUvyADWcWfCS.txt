Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. Um so so uh. So for for for for for our first episode we're going to get into the movie um like like um Carrie the original old old old old old school one from 1976. So um uh um like I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one one one one one of like uh I mean like my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones so so like um she she she she she saw in the theater growing up. I was like I mean like I mean introduced to this movie when I I I I I was about nine or ten, which like okay you know you know given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly wildly wildly wildly wildly I mean so I mean like inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
