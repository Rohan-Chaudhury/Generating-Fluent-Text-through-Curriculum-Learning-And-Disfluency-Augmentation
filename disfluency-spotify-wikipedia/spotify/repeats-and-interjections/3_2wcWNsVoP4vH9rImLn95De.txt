So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I um like well I I I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to uh um you know my coach because because because because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings okay okay you know about parenting and how hard it can can can can be sometimes and so so uh I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this this this this okay you know like pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know like you know um know know know better than to do but I just kind of got caught uh um okay in a a a a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so um so uh my coach said something to to to to me so very profound and the well you know you know shift that it has created since then has been so so so so powerful um okay you know that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
