At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a a a Southern well like state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six six like uh six feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting sitting sitting like so on the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to well you know to to notice a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll you know um bet that that that person who lost that hat is very sorry now after you know well the Hat had floated out of of of sight. Around the corner of the house you know I mean the boy kept on watching the river river river suddenly much to his okay so surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously obviously uh well obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around around you know you know around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a while. While like you know while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
