It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels like within a small range range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy like needed by every living cell. Cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce well enough energy if blood blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative okay impact on osmosis, which is the the movement of water between cells by I mean affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. Pancreas. The body can detect if well there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the the concentration of blood glucose is um too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream bloodstream the well liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the the excess glucose into well glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble and and can be stored I mean for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
