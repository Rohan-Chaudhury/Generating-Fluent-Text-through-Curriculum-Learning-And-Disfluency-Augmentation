Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on the John John um Hopkins database. So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty seven so cases cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the you know United United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. Okay. 102 cases confirmed with six six deaths all happening in Washington, which is like interesting that we haven't had any deaths in in California. And so there might be something um specific look going on in in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
