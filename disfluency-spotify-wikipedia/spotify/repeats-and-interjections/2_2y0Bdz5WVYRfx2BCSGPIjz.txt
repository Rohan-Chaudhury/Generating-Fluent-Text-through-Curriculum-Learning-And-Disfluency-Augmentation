together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel gospel gospel okay you know how Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day I mean like he gets gets gets up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be um well with God to to to be with the father in prayer. And when you uh like had gone up to be with with with the father in prayer, he um so went there to pray and Simon Peter comes comes comes to him and he okay uh says to him we've been looking for you and and and Jesus says while uh you know I needed to be with the father but also need to to like so to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. Uh well. It is is is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. Like um. He begins it by by by being with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
