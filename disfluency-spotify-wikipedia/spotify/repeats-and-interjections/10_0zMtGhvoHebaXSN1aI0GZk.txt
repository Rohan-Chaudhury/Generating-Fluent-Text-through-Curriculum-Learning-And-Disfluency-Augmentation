It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a um uh okay you know um so like okay uh well small small small small small small small small small small small range Lucas is um well okay you know you know uh um like I mean you know important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living living living living living living okay like okay okay well you know uh okay uh well living living living living living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism um you know I mean like so I mean well um well you know cannot produce enough energy if if if if if if if if if if you know like you know you know uh so um well um I mean if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which I mean like uh uh uh okay you know like okay okay is is is is is is is is is is is the movement of water so like okay so so you know um you know you know you know between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through through through through through through you know I mean I mean you know I mean okay I mean uh um so through through through through through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is you know well I mean uh uh okay okay um so so a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if if if if if if if if you know you know so uh uh like I mean uh I mean um if if if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases uh okay so I mean okay okay okay I mean um okay the hormone insulin into the the the the the the the the the you know so um okay you know so well I mean well so the the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert you know uh I mean so okay uh well well you know so the the the the the the the the the the the excess glucose well well you know so like well you know well well I mean into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble insoluble insoluble insoluble insoluble I mean you know uh like well okay well uh I mean um insoluble insoluble insoluble insoluble insoluble insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process um you know okay so like okay well so well like continues until the pancreas detects a a a a a a a a well okay well um so um uh uh you know uh a a a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
