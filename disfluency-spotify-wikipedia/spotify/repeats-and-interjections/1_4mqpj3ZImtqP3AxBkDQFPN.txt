Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a regular regular okay Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some shit I mean shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of um of which is the fact that I have literally not had a job like for the past. Past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from you know like a gig gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of you know my mother and my bank account. I I have not consistently been working and you know I think that's for a few reasons. One of of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
