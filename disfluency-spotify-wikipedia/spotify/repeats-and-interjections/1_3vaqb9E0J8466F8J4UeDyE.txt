Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if well you want to to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I um reported that Madison Pruitt with with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link well in the description and and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated like that Maddie was certainly going going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead okay because Claire Crawley was announced announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get like this straight. Maddie was filming filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not uh the Bachelorette so she has to be be the winner of this season, right? Is there okay any other reason Maddie would have have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of so right now I see no other explanation explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let um me know your thoughts down in the comments below. Below. That's all I've got for like today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're you're new to Clare Crawley, I just I mean did a deep dive on her earlier earlier today. So check that out on this channel uh and make sure you check out our our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. You know. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham.
