Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard towards I mean ascension. Ascension. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I am like joined by by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream so speakers in another episode episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I so thought it might be nice to to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. You know. I am doing fine. I was on the the Midnight Express podcast to uh talk about the woo Kang now we talked for almost almost two and a well A half hours just about the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the I mean the Hem Caso back where they take it where he takes 18 pages of material material so and talks about that for two hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I mean I made made was I forgot that Australian summer time and North American okay summer time do not occur occur at the same time. So I'm like, let's figure so out a time to record what will will be good and I'm like 9:00 p.m. Uh. Your time sounds good and I work backwards backwards and like I can wake like up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
