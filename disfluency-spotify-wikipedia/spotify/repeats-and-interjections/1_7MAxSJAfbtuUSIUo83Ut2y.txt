As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot uh hoot and a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so uh it it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was like through through the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, well which was probably a a fire hazard looking back at it but us so being students not our number one problem and and really it was just bingo. So so anybody could win and there were Current objects objects of pleasure. I guess you could so say I'm not too sure what is safe safe for the radio. So I'm going to like kind of curve that but also objects objects to practice safe sex like our well ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids on on the watch of Plymouth state. Okay. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded funded money on these objects um of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
