It's much appreciated Gamecock fans everywhere appreciate your vigilance vigilance your dedication to I mean traveling and I sound like I'm being sarcastic because it's not not a clock. In like the morning, but I'm being serious because Friday you were in in Colombia. You covered um the baseball game and then Saturday morning you woke up up and drove um to Tuscaloosa. Watch the basketball game. And then you said you stayed okay stayed overnight in Hoover or Birmingham somewhere thereabouts and then drove to Clemson, South Carolina well first first thing Sunday morning to cover the baseball game then came back to colombia.
