And it's the whole crew here today and we're going to um do this this ourselves in a minute, but guys, I realized just the so other day that we've been been at this for a year. Well, I so think this is like episode 56 or or something. Maybe it maybe that's wrong. Um. We need the fact Checkers out there to to correct us, you know, occasionally we uh do say things that are not correct often speak speak for yourself. Awesome, we correct um each other in the course of the show, show, but that just has because uh we do is almost zero prep. We just just kind of come from wherever well we are and we sit down and and and I think most of the time we well do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Catches Us from someplace else. Never glad. Uh. I'm glad that I don't think it's it's ever happened to Glenn. I'm glad you got you know me last week on Warfield and and Whitfield.
