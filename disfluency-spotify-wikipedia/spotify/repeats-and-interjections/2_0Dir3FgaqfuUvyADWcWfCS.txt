Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So you know like for our our our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original you know uh old school one from from from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. So um. It was one of my mother's favorite. So So So I think it was one well uh of the first ones she saw in the theater growing growing growing up. I was like I mean introduced to this movie when I was about nine or ten, ten, ten, which okay well given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. But I turned turned turned so um out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
