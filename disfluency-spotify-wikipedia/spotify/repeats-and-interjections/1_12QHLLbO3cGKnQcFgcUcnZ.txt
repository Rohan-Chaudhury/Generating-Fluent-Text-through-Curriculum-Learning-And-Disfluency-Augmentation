Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If okay you you follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know I mean that that I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the uh word of God. And And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will okay be looking at real real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll okay be using and speaking very very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. I mean. My heart behind this is that as as we go through tests and like trials which we can't obviously avoid but we will will our mindset that we would well go through it will be different. I am so convinced and and I okay have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
