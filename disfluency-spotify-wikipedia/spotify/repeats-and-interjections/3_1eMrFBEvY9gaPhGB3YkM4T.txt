Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was okay so I mean was was was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism um well so right right right right in front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth so you know well we reading the rules rules rules rules again. And again, it was so uh well um dark in here that I had to use use use use the small I mean I mean like lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights so you know well lights lights lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Um uh so. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. Me me me. It didn't do much damage. This uh so okay is going to be a great shift. The first first first first thing I uh uh um tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my my my my uh I mean well peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
