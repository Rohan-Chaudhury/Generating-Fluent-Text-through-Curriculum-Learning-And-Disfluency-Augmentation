Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm your host so host Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock central.com Kyle so and Taylor here here to talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite impressive 12-point home victory uh over the the Mississippi State Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had you know to have and they they did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for you know South. Carolina they got got up big early and then they squandered almost every single ounce I mean of that lead going into into halftime and then by the second half things kind of so evened out in South South Carolina, they didn't Coast because you know, they only won um by 12 and most of of the time they were up by like six okay or something like that but it felt felt comfortable in South Carolina did it so without getting a single spectacular performance but a lot lot of good performances from a uh lot of different areas and as much as we've talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
