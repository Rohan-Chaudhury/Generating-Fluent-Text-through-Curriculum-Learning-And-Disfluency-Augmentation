Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be well going going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be so be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your uh sides. You You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you know you you want to make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or well or a wall if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting sitting in like a chair have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your uh your knees. So once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your okay hands, hands, I want you to find your navel. So with your thumbs I mean identify your navel and then then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
