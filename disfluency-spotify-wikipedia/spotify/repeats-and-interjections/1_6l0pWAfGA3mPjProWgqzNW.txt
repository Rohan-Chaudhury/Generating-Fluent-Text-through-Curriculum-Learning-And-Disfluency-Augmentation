Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may uh may ask that is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven years you know old old Nate nasty couple of nicknames. He had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Ace I mean Qbert boos. Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I I mean assure you you I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years I mean but the the reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because so he has a a propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four uh weeks at a time or or maybe even a couple days when I get my okay sad boy moments. I'm talking talking six months to a year. This man can well disappear at times. He has a lot lot of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
