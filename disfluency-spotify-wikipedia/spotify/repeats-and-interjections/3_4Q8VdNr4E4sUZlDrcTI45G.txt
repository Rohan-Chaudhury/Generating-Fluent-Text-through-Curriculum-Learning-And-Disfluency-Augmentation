I think it was my 18th birthday so well so that that that that that I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of uh um okay got stiffed it out a a a a little bit the day up. But uh well well for the most part very few things things things things surprise me. It is difficult so like uh to imagine the way that the disciples must. Must must must. Have felt here um I mean um towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting starting starting starting so like um in verse 19 following it says this and the evening of that first day of well I mean uh the the the the week when the disciples were together with the doors locked for like I mean okay fear of the the the the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and said uh um well peace be with you you you you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
