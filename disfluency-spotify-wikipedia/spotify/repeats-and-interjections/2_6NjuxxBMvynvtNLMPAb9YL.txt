Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get um uh a a a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget I mean uh Les Mills. I forget forget forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being you know um a workout. I just just just listened to the songs and I have them on the uh okay whole time. Like when I'm I'm I'm in the shower when I'm making food when so I mean I'm doing the laundry when I'm training training training gym, I just try and listen so uh to the music as many times as possible, but but but I'm not even you know okay thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's It's It's um so just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand like you know stand stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what well I mean that's going going going to be or when it will be but it just like okay happens after you listen listen listen to it for a while and then when you actually well okay then go right let's let's let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two uh you know things come together and you teach teach teach your already naturally in the music. So those you know I mean little moments that your son or or or little hit movement or shoulder uh um wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
