This is your everyday positivity here on Vale. Hello. I'm Kate Crocker. I I hope you know you're well today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough? I I had a well moment this week with my coach about accountability and I was really surprised. Surprised. So. It's always really surprising when you think I've got that bit sorted and I'm always so always really good at that and then someone asks you a question and you go always um always like that. I think I'm good at that or the time actually good at uh that that so I have been challenged this week and And it's hard. It's hard well pushing yourself through through those challenges. It feels uncomfortable you get that vulnerable feeling like around your heart and you you your instinct says right. I need to okay move away from this. I don't want want to go there t harv Eker in I mean his book. The millionaire mindset says life life gets easy when you do the hard stuff well and challenging yourself is about doing the hard hard stuff. So something is really challenging you um at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
