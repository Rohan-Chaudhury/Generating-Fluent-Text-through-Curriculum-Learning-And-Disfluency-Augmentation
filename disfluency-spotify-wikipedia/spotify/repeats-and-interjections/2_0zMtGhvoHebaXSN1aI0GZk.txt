It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within like okay a a a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by you know well every every every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot well I mean produce enough energy energy energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have uh so a negative impact on osmosis, osmosis, osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by like okay affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the the the pancreas. The body can like um detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if if if the well well concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into into I mean so into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the like like the the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is I mean well insoluble and can be be be stored for later. Use this process continues so um until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose glucose glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
