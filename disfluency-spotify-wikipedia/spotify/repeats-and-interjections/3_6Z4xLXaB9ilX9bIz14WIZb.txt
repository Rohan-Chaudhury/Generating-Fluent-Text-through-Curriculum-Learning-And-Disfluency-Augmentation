It was a okay uh well welcome respite after a long day of traveling the sleeping men were were were were so you know um well exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in their midst. Under the the well I mean I mean the the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured by so uh um bison meat that that that that had been hung up to dry. If it decided like um okay it wanted to snack on on on on some humans. There would be no um um uh stopping it unaware of the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
