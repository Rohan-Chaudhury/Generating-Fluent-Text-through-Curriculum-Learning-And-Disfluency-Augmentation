They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in like I mean you know okay so first place of of of of of of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps okay uh I mean well so are still in first place due to to to to to to the tiebreak, which is crazy uh well okay I mean well to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that that that that that I mean well um uh uh that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if technically like you know you know you know you know technically technically technically technically technically they're not in first. All I care about um uh I mean okay like is when you look at the the the the the the points it is tied. This very well okay well like so moment and just the fact that that is is is is is is the situation um like um so like we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So So uh well uh like I mean So So So So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one uh like so you know I mean on a second half of a a a a a a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
