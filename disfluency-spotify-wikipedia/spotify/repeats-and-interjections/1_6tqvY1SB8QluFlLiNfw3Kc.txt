Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are um so nasty. Nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place like of the metropolitan. Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due okay to the the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the like tiebreaker because that that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, uh I don't care if if technically they're not in first. All I care about is okay when you look look at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the so fact that that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what so makes me so so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to so one on a second second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
