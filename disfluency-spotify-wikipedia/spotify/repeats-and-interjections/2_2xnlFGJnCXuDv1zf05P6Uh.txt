What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the um uh gross gross gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S I mean okay and plasmid model model model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really you know so really excited about from a financial financial financial perspective. So going to nerd out you know um on this shout out to the third row podcast. Podcast podcast. I came up the well well idea for this episode. We were just recording and we're we're we're talking about well I mean this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's like like like like so a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new new new um well tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you you you know okay you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these I mean you know brake brake brake pads which are geared to make it perform better so uh on the track. It's gotten gotten gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. Well okay. And I was was was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla I mean okay as sort of this this this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new so well features and and and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds um okay would love and and and the track package is one example, but what I think okay I mean is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
