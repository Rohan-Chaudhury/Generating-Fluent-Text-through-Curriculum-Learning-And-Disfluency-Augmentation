Tom Brady greatest of all time you know you know time time Now if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you um I mean that that that he's staying put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. Okay uh. You staying staying staying put it just doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him okay so somebody that that that has been in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it um uh all with with with one team just doesn't make sense for me to um so it's just doesn't doesn't doesn't make sense to me.
