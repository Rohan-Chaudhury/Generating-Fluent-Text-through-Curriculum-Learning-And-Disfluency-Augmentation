Did. This is actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this okay little Snippets recorded recorded after your episode. Halftime, so we actually did have our guests on a I mean little bit earlier earlier this week. Yeah, when he was here because of the uh way that you know, this this Gus could make it around but you know, you know we're recording the intro after after we record the actual episode. Typically. We like to uh record the intro this this snippet snippet part without the guest even being around. I mean. Yeah. So it just the way it works. Works. So usually we recorded before um the guest shows up this last step the set set this guess we didn't have time you know to yeah. But anyways, how was how was your week bit how how things been for you?.
