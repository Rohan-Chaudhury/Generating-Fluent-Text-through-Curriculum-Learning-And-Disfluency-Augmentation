Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking talking so to you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Well. Assets. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just just um about how much money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing establishing Harmony I mean in your personal life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that that I mean good stuff. I get so many questions from people as I travel the world um helping. Helping. Some VIP. So this is our time for us to be together and for uh for me to answer your questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have uh been in a a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's okay actually more vocal about it it than I am but it's a little frustrating when I mean I see others getting married and and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely I mean happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
