A way, which I um okay well okay I mean like you know I mean I I I I I I I I know better than to do but I I mean okay so well okay I mean uh I mean just kind of got caught in a loop loop loop loop loop loop loop um uh so so like uh I mean so loop loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to like like like okay well you know I mean like me so so so so so so so so so very profound and the you know like you know I mean like well you know like shift that it has created since then has been so powerful that that that like I mean so so well you know so so that that that that that that he just knew that I had to share it with you.
