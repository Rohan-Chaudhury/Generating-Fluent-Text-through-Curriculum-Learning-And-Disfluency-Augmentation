Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. We are well are joined. Once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very special episode. I I like you know these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological career of the competitor or or like the coach that we interview in this case. We interviewed. And since it was was the like second time we had him on we'd already covered his career. And so I okay I got to talk about a lot of things on this show and I had uh I'd get get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on a lot of different things you know and we we kind of went through a couple topics one was his little brother well Greg just want want his fifth State title High School in New York. And well so we talked a little little bit about that and then Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
