We are uh a fitness based based community in North Spokane that does coach lead strength and conditioning like this podcast is is honestly something that's been on my mind for a while and it's uh time time for it to go. So here we go with episode. I want to talk like talk a little bit about why we're doing this and what to expect like and who it's it's for. So let's get right into it.
