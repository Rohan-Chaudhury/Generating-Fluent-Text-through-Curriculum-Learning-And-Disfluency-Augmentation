Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if if uh you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that well Madison Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew well Link in the the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated I mean that Maddie Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory okay is officially dead because Claire Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So so let me get this this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but I mean she's not the Bachelorette so so she has to be the winner of this season, okay right? Is there any other other reason Maddie would have been filming this is like unconfirmed. But as of right now now I see no other explanation unless y'all have uh other theories. Let me know your thoughts thoughts down in the comments below. You know. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News News Daily. But if you're uh new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on on her earlier so today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check out I mean out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on uh AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
