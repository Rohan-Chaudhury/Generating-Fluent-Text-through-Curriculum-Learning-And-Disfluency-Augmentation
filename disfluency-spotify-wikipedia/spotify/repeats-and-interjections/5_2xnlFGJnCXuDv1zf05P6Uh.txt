What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the okay well uh well so gross gross gross gross gross gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid like you know so you know um mode Model S and and and and and and plasmid model X on Tesla by this like well I mean well so is something I'm really really excited about from from from from from from a financial perspective. So you know well I mean I mean. So going to nerd out on this shout out to to to to to um like you know like like to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were well um well well I mean just just just just just just recording and we're talking about this new track uh I mean uh you know okay package that came out for for for for for for the model 3. It's like a you know well so uh um $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these these these these these these really cool well okay you know you know well looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost cost cost cost you know you know so uh so cost cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for uh uh you know so I mean these these these these these these new tires and these brake pads which are um you know I mean um you know geared to make it perform better on on on on on on the track. Um well so I mean okay. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I I uh you know so uh okay I I I I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla like so like I mean well as sort of of of of of of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of uh uh uh so okay these fancy new features and services that that that that that that sort of well well um well like Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track track track you know uh uh um okay track track track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
