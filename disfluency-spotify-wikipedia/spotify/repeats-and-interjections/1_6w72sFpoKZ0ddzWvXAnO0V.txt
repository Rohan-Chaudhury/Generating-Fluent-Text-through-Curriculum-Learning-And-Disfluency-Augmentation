Perhaps the most deceptively titled episode The Origin of Species was not actually about the okay the fucking word genus species. But back to chapter 24 to see what it actually you know actually is about today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to biology for bastards so teaching teaching biology and the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your okay host John Doe Doe D. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology so one chapter at at a time this week. We're on the chapter 24, I mean which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
