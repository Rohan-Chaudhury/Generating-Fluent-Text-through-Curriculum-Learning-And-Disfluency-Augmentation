It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within within within well you know so like I mean I mean um so okay within within within within within within within a small range Lucas is well like uh like okay so well um well important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by by by by by uh uh you know okay so um um okay okay by by by by by every living cell. If there is not enough glucose like um um so so uh I mean uh um an organism cannot produce enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough energy okay so okay uh I mean um um you know I mean if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative negative negative well you know so okay you know I mean uh well you know negative negative negative negative negative negative negative impact on osmosis, which is the movement of well like um okay so uh okay you know uh water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as as as as as as so I mean I mean okay okay well like um I mean as as as as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there okay I mean well well like I mean I mean like well is a high high high high high high high high high high concentration. Enough blood glucose I mean you know um like I mean so um okay like if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas I mean well I mean you know like okay well um well pancreas pancreas pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle so okay okay uh uh well well uh I mean tissues detect the presence of of of of of of of of of of insulin well okay okay um okay um you know well so these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that that I mean okay you know okay you know okay okay so like that that that that that that that that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Well okay um I mean you know I mean okay you know like. Use this process continues until the pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas you know uh uh like I mean well well um uh pancreas pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
