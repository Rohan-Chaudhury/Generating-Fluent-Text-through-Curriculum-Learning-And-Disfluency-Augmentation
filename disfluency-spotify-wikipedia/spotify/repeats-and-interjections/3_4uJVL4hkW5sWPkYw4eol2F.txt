Now, you might be wondering why are you know you know well we talking about about about about Parnell given that which is an affluent suburb you know well you know in Auckland given that it is is is is probably not likely an uh uh like investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a a a a couple uh uh well of weeks ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks you know okay you know banks banks banks in New Zealand and they said can you comment on an uh um okay article that we're writing for for for for our website where they were uh so I mean showing by the latest core logic data that the the the the the median gross I mean um uh rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 22 22 22. Percent. Whereas okay like I mean a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is is is is 5.1% and uh you know like they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
