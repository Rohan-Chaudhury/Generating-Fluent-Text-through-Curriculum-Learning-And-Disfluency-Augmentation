It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your your your your professional life um okay okay spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many many many well I mean you know many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some VIP.

I have been in okay well okay a committed relationship for 15 years. Years years years. We talked about marriage. He's you know um like actually more vocal about it than I am but it's it's it's it's a little like well uh frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their families. Families families families. Um um so. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
