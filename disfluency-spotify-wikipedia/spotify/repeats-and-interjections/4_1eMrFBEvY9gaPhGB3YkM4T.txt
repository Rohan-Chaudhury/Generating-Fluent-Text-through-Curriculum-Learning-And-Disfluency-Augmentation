Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I I I I mean you know well um I I was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism um I mean um I mean right right right right right in front of my eyes. I just sat in my well um I mean I mean booth we reading the rules again. Again again again again. And again, it was uh you know like so so dark in here that I had to use the the the the the um uh um I mean small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the you know um I mean I mean lights lights lights lights lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the I mean I mean well you know first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing me. It didn't do much like you know you know so damage. This is going to be a great shift. The The The The The first thing like okay um you know I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my my uh you know uh um my my my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
