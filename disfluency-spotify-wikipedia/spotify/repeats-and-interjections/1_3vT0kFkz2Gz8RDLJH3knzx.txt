I'll is international Women's Day on Sunday the 8th of well March, so so we thought it'd be a good opening topic as two female podcast. I mean. Has Amy what what could stuff have you heard in the news this week? Okay, so so I know in in a moment you're going to be talking okay about a really huge piece of news news that was covered in the I mean media last week. So I thought it might be be nice for me to start with okay maybe a slightly smaller you story that people haven't haven't necessarily heard about and I okay was scrolling through Twitter last week and stumbled across across an article about hair salons and basically a number of salons across the UK have been boycotting gossip magazines.
