Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be I mean be your host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to so to renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse uh is taken taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and so greatest day of of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let okay anyone who is thirsty thirsty come to me and drink when we view okay the invitation to come to to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. Uh. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
