As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and okay um a half. Half half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that um I mean so it was a little odd knocking knocking knocking alive, but the camaraderie in so I mean that room was through the roof. We had just just just about over a so I mean hundred people in one room, which was probably a fire hazard looking looking looking back well well at it but us being students not our number one problem and really uh like really really it was just bingo. So anybody could win and there were Current uh like objects objects objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too uh okay sure what is safe for the the the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve I mean so that but also objects to practice safe safe safe sex like our ad you know well reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the watch watch watch of Plymouth State. There's um okay over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these these these objects of well like pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
