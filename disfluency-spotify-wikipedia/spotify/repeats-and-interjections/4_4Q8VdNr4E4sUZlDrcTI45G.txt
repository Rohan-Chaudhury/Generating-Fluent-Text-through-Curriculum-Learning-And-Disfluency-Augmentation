Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I I um um um so I I I guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that um so um um that I I I I I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of you know you know um so got stiffed it out a little little little little little bit the day up. Uh okay you know you know. But for the most part very few things surprise me. It is is is is um so well like is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here towards well well so like the end end end end end of chapter 20 and the Book uh well well well of John starting in verse 19 following following following following following it says this and so well so uh the evening of that first day of the week when the the the the the so so well I mean disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus came okay like like like and and and and and stood among them and said peace be with you after so you know uh um he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
