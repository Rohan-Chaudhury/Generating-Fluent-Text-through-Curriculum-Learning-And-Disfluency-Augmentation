As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a um you know like hoot and a half. Half half half. What does sex Bingo and tail well uh so because I missed that so it was a a a a little odd knocking alive, you know well you know but the camaraderie in that room was through through through through the roof. Uh so I mean. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which which uh you know um which which was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students uh I mean you know not not not not our number one problem and really it was just you know I mean uh bingo. So anybody could win and there there there there were Current objects of well so well pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure sure sure sure what is well uh okay safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but so okay uh but but but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. Well well um. So nobody was getting getting getting getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth like so well State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped dropped dropped dropped Plymouth state funded money okay okay well on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
