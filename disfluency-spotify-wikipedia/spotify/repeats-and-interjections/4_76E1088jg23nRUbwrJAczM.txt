Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be um um um well be be be be explaining to each and every single male out there uh you know you know you know specifically how to become more more more more more masculine to determine your um uh I mean so fate. And the reason why I feel that that that that that this is such uh you know so I mean an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to to to to uh you know um you know to actually control their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so I mean uh I mean like that way way way way way they're in control of what they would like well well like like and as a man this is is is is is important to your you know well okay like success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only only only only only well I mean um you know that if you want to become a man of value so that way like um I mean well other men or or or or or other people in general can lean like you know so um on you. You're going to have to learn this. This this this this. I mean you know uh you know. So here's the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if okay you know you know I mean you're a a a a a person who cannot sit there and focus for well like so um two to five minutes, you're not going going going going going to do very well. Okay, um like like well because this video might take me a little bit to to to to uh um like um to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five I mean uh um like to ten ten ten ten ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
