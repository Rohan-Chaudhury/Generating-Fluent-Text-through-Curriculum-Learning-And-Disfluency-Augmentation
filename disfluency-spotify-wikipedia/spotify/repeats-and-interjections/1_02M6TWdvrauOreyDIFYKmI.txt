Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly you know weekly podcast podcast and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as uh so far and want want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made well a mistake on the Caroline Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme you know she put out and about be be kind and I notice when I listen you know back to it that I said be nice. Nice. It's not a big mistake. It's um not a big difference, but You know my my OCD kicked in and like I kind of wanted to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
