Good morning, everyone Welcome to our Friday spending time with Jesus podcast today. Um. I wanted us us to look at Romans chapter 1 the entire book of well Romans is jam-packed with with Theology and interesting thoughts and just like amazing Epic.

No matter where they've grown up so or what they've heard heard all their lives and it's an incredible chapter it lists out I mean all the ways that we we can act basically in sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that.
