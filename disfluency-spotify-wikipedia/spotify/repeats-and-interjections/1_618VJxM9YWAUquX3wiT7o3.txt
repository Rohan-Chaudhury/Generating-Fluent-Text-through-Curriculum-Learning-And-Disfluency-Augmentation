Keep it up permanently. Let me tell you something. You already know the world so ain't ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and so I don't care how how tough you are. It will beat you to your um knees and keep you there there permanently. If you let it you me or I mean nobody is gonna hit as hard hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you like hit it's about how how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward you know how much you can take take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. I mean. Well, if you know what what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But you you know gotta be willing to take take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you um ain't where you wanna be because because of him or her or anybody cowards do that. Uh. And that ain't you you you better than that. It's about how hard you I mean can get hit and keep moving moving forward. Yo. Yo yo, it's your boy Evan. Those were little bit of words from Rocky.
