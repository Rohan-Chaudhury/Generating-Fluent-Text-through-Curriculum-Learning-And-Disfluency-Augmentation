Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on vale. Well. I I was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder so song as as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And you know all it did did for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song you know for me of all all time, which is called Love's in Need of Love you know Today. I mean, first of all all when you come up with a song lyric okay like that, you've got to go. Um, Um, man, I've nailed life love is in you know need of Love Today and He's He's my favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love um sitting and listening to it the message message on it. Is that Love's in okay Need of Love today? We need to give the love love back to so ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted to to get you okay to consider that you can apply this to lots of of things in your I mean life and fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
