Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to uh be be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to like become more masculine masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel uh that this is such an an important topic is because people have no idea well nowadays how to actually control control their Destiny or how to actually control their you know fate so that way they're in in control of what they would like and as like a man this is important to your success. Success. This is ridiculously important to your I mean happiness. And not only that if you you want to become a man of value so okay that way other men or other people people in general can lean on you. You know. You're going to have to learn this. So So here's the deal. If like you don't have a very high attention span, if you're you're a person who I mean cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're you're not going to okay do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little little bit to well explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five five to well ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
