Hi everyone. Welcome to ocbc insights. I'm Selena Ling Chief Economist for CPC bang bang um today. I'm sharing with you about the feds emergency 50 basis point cut so the fat fat unanimously cut the federal funds rate by an emergency 50-point citing I mean a material change in the the u.s. Outlook due to the covid-19 outbreak fed chairman uh Powell basically indicated that the virus and and the measures that are being taken I mean to contain. It will surely way on economic activity both both in the US so and abroad for some time. This came earlier than scheduled March fomc fomc meeting okay but clearly illustrates. What we said about the FED being cornered in to like to a 50 basis point cut by market. The question that remains is where where uh will the FED go from here? If you reference the G7 meeting of Finance uh Chiefs Chiefs that actually felt to reveal more than verbal jawboning. So our senses look like to the the market reaction Wall Street quickly sold off while US Treasury bonds got an adrenaline boost. We saw the two-year you.
