Yo, yo, yo, what's up everyone? I guess I'll kick off this podcast addressing you know addressing probably the biggest talk in sports right now. Tom Brady greatest of all all uh time Now if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you um that that he's staying put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying well staying put it just doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody that well has has been in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one you know one team just doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense um to to me. So it doesn't make sense to me for this man the go well out and and play for another team at 43 years old after spending his entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just doesn't make sense for.
