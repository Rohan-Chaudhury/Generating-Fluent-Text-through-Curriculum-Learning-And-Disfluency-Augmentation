He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other other like religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to like reinvent reinvent religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while listening um listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I like highly highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of I mean the speakers speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting like it replaced. So So instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still I mean enjoyable when when it's only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so uh podcasts because because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
