Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had like had girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is like he do you you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you okay do? Yes, Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything you know else had had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn uh especially especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I I mean meant to to be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So so I do need to have have ways of getting around that which may I mean involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
