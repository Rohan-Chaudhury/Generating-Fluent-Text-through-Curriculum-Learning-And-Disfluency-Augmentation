Hey, what is up CI squads? We're back. We're back with another episode, 's I'm pretty so pretty energized right now. Just got off the back of doing some live training to Bluestone okay Bluestone College. I did four locations in one hit which is the power well of the the internet and amazing technological breakthrough where you can be in four places at um at one time. So very very exciting stuff and that's kind of inspired. Is well this this little podcast that I'm putting together for you today? But before we get okay into that, I I want to give a shout out so over the last uh couple of weeks. I've been been running a little bit of a giveaway. So well for anyone that that leaves a review on iTunes and sends me over a screenshot. I will well enter them into into a draw to win a little little gift from like me. So I just been scanning the reviews we've had some new reviews come through and I'm going to pick how.
