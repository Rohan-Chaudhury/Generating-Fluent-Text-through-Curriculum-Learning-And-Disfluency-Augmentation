Welcome to the hottest take my name is Chris Ryan. I am joined joined by Jason um concepci√≥n Juliet Littman and David Shoemaker and David you have before. I know know that uh we fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country country needs well is a king. Oh my God now listen. Listen, I'm not saying we we um need a monarch with absolute power. I'm not saying we need to go to uh to some like Royal Dutch like diagnostic system. But look at England right now how so much much better would our political discourse be if we would just elect the king like for every like like a decade every 10 years. Donald Trump gets to be I mean king. But we have have a like a boring-ass technocrat. Who's They're as prime um minister is actually making the the decision, right? So he's have a guy who's I mean a guy or a gal whose whose job is to go to NASCAR races and give speeches so and set off. Off. The first fireworks on the fourth of July. If you want to figure out is what I want a figure, how did.
