You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and you know like um and and and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading okay so like sweet to work on on on on their projects. They sit on this color couch so uh okay of mine for an hour a a a a day or weeks on I mean uh I mean end depending on the project those clients might be directors directors directors directors writers producers or like um um cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. Work work work. You know um like. On the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but I mean um like but but but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. So I mean you know. It's a glimpse behind behind behind behind the curtain of film and television you know so okay the podcast will talk about color from from from from time to time, but okay I mean well it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
