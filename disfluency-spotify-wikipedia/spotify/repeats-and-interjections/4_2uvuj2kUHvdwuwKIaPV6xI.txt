July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year like you know I mean uh old old old old old came home from a long day at work and so you know so okay kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez over over over over over dinner. He glanced out a so um I mean uh window to watch the Summer sun setting over San Jose the the the the the I mean uh uh so largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it seemed after well I mean you know uh dinner. Dinner dinner dinner dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin okay so so like just like most nights but but but but but right away something felt different. It was so well like uh all wrong. The drugs burned hot through through through through through his veins unlike um well um okay anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to hallucinate and eventually eventually eventually well I mean um uh eventually eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
