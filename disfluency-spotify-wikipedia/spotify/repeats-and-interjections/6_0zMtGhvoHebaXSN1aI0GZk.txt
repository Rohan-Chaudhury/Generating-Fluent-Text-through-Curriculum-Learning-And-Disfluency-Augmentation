It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a like okay um well I mean um a a a a a a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases um like like well um well The energy needed by every living living living living living living living cell. If there is not uh well like like you know uh enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood blood blood blood blood blood you know um like uh well um blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, okay I mean um you know okay um which which which which which which which is the movement of water between cells by affecting so so well well you know I mean concentration gradients as blood flows flows flows flows flows flows flows through the pancreas. Like okay I mean I mean uh like. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood blood blood blood okay so uh okay like well blood blood blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the well I mean like you know okay like pancreas releases the the the the the the the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver like uh uh so okay well and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin insulin um well so okay like I mean these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that like okay so you know you know you know is is is is is is is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this you know well so so I mean well process continues until the pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas detects a normal blood glucose like um okay well well um concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
