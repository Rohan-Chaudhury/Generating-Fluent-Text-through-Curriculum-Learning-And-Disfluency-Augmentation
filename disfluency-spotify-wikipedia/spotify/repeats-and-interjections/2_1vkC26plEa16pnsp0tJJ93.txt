Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to you know okay to to leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're well so recording this on on on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a I mean uh couple days to digest some some some of the performances from the skill position players and I mean well that's what we're going to to to talk about today the offense of risers and I mean I mean fallers from the combine. And I know I I I said this on last you know like week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot freak out out out about so you know one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I mean most okay like most most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're / like fractions fractions like like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your view of a um like player but but but we did learn some things some players had much better showing okay you know than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
