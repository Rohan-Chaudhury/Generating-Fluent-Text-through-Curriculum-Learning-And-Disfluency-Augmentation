So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And I mean you know you know like you know yes, I I I I I I have a coach coaches need coaches and I mean um I mean I mean well I was talking to my coach because I I I I I I had well okay I mean uh you know been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it can you know I mean okay you know okay be be be be be be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself so uh well well I mean to fall into this pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern of just beating myself up you know you know I mean well uh in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know know know know know know well so well I mean okay better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop and like uh so well okay it's it's it's it's it's it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said well uh okay um uh something to me so very very very very very very profound and the shift I mean you know I mean okay I mean that it has created since then has been so powerful that he he he uh um so so well he he he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
