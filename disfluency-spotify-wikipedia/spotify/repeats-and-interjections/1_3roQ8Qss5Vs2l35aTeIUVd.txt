Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things uh well, well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers you know me that the the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's you know six of us in in this household and this couch is falling apart. Uh. You're supposed to sit on a couch not not walk on it not uh run on it now jump on it and dance on it. It. Do not do uh WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. So when you catch catch them like doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they just can't can't help um themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when you well you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
