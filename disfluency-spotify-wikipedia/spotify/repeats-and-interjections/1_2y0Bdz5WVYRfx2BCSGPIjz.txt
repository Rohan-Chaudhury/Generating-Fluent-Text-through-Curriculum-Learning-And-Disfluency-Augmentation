And when you had gone like up to be be with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and well Simon Peter Peter comes to him and he says to him we've been I mean looking for you and Jesus Jesus says while I needed to be with the father okay but also need to go somewhere somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would you know like us to unpack. It is the attitude attitude of Jesus in picking the day. I mean. He begins it by being with God the father father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
