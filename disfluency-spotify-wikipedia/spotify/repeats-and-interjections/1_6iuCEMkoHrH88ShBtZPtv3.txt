In a world where two people God in a podcast for too early early for well this but their cat at 6:00 in the morning. If you here here they start you know to do a bomb gasps gasps gasps this are you done? No, let let so me have my fun. If you hear little sniffling and little like chipmunk noises in uh in the background, that's our kitten Nona if you haven't been following along the uh the latest week or two kitchen. You're so like you come up with the like the stupidest jokes when we feel like they're they're bad. They're not good. Like they're I mean not not funny. Oh my God. No I so we don't even want to marry me. I don't know.
