Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with your um your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for tuning tuning uh in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why uh when when and how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to you know me, let let me at least help you understand who I am. I've been an so RD for about about 5 years now. I've worked in many different places. I so started off at a nursing nursing home from there. I was able you know to go into a clinic Uncle setting working working at New York like Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice World, which is is really okay where I wanted to be I was able to sit with people for longer well longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we okay we were able to see each other for a bit more than five or or ten uh minutes and you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in in a couple okay minutes in between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because because they've you know been here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
