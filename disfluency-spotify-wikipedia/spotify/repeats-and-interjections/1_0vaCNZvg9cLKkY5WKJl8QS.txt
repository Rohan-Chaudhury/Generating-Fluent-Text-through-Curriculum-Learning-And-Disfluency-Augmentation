Hey everybody. Welcome to Mom Hood, it's Wednesday. We're so glad um that that you're here. I hope you guys are having a beautiful week. We okay are stoked because because today is part 2 of the October Gonzalez interview and like we have been absolutely absolutely dying to release this one. So this episode focuses um all on marriage and motherhood and and man. There are some nuggets up in here. I okay can't wait for you guys guys to hear it. If this is the first so one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Recommend. Going back and listening to like part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do do think that all of the well information in part to her story all her tips the the way that she uh parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost more more like valuable when you you know know where she came from part 1 is all all about her life as you know a young girl how she was parented her family story story Dynamic her as a young so woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
