Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What like like I mean you know, know, know, know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it um like so your entire life. Life life life. That there's something wrong with this world. You don't know um I mean well what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you crazy.
