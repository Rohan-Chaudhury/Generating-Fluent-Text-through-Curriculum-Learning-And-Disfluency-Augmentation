Welcome back to emerge today's guest probably needs no introduction. For those of you so who have have been following the podcast for some time as speaking with Robert um Keegan Robert or Bob Bob Keegan. It has a long history of working you know in the field of adult development. And And if you're not familiar with Bob's work, you I mean will be after listening to this this show. We do a kind of Action to you know his work an overview of the the 5 stage model that he created and that uh has been studied empirically for the the last 40 years. And the reason why I mean I wanted to talk to Bob Keegan Keegan isn't just because you know, he's like kind of a huge inspiration for me but but also because I wanted to have his voice in the mix at the very beginning of this.
