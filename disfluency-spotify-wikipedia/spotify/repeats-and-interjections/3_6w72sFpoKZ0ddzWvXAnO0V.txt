Perhaps the most deceptively titled episode The Origin of Species was not actually about about like um so about about the fucking word genus species. But back to chapter 24 to see what like I mean you know it actually actually actually actually is about today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to you know so uh biology for bastards bastards bastards bastards teaching biology and the most profane way you've ever seen so well I mean or heard. I'm your your your your host John Doe D. Thanks for listening this season. Uh um um. We're going through AP Biology one chapter chapter chapter chapter at a time this week. We're on I mean uh um the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
