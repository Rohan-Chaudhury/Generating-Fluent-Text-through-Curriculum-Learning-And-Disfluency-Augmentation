Hello and welcome to that's akitaka great episode for you today lot of stuff so to talk talk about a lot of stuff off the ice, which I want to get uh to to First. The NHL is apparently unveiling a new Puck filled with okay Quote unquote electronics electronics and they're going to be testing out during the playoffs. This well is the first first time they're going to throw it in used at least that okay we know of of so read a little article about this AQ and we okay were just talking about this before we we went live here. They've apparently used this uh puck in a couple games during the the regular season without telling the you know teams or players that they were using it. They've given given it to a few um of the Superstar players throughout the league the practice practice with the see so if they can notice anything feedback was generally positive. Of course only one player noticed some issues with it. No Sidney Crosby. He said he could notice.
