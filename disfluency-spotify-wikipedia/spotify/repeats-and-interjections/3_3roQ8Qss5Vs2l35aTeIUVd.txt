There's six of us us us us in this household and this couch okay so okay is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch couch couch couch not walk on well okay okay it not run on it now jump on it and dance on on on um so you know on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. So um uh I mean when you catch catch catch catch them doing it because they know they're um you know like not supposed to but they just can't help themselves, themselves, themselves, themselves, but do a well okay you know little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I I I um uh um I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
