Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing it like uh in a a a Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The well okay men of Lewis and and and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along I mean okay the banks of the Missouri Missouri Missouri River. It was a welcome you know you know respite after a long day of traveling the sleeping men men men were so exhausted. So so. They had no idea an intruder was in their midst. Under Under Under the cover like uh of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured by bison meat meat meat okay well that had been hung up to dry. If it decided it wanted to snack on you know uh on on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware of the okay um looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
