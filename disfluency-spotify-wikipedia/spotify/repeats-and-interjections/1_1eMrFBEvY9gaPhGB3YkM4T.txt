Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I um I was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right like right in front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we like reading the the rules again. And again, it was so dark in here you know that I had to use use the small lamp on the table next to me. So. They really need to fix the lights lights here. Yeah, I also realized I you know had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than than traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. Well. This is going to be a great shift. Shift. The first thing I tried um was to walk out but I could see movement movement in my peripheral vision. I mean. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
