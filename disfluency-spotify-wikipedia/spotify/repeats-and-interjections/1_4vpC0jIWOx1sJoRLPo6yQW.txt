So the time is probably going to come when I delete all these you know episodes right? right I think so. I don't want to just let it well sit here if I'm not not using it, but what's happening today why I'm well talking to you today is because it's warm warm out. I think it's uh in the 50s to me. This is warm when outside was was still wearing so a light down coat. Had all my stuff with me as most most like New Yorkers do we're always carrying stuff. Just taking out the trash. Too warm warm well All right. Someone's actually letting me cross. I'm shocked. Thank you. Almost got killed like by by someone before crossing the street. Thank you for being polite. So I was like was too hot. I came downstairs light down coat scarf in my bag too hot went back up put.
