Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had um so to have and they they they did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory you know you know for South. Carolina they got up up up big early and then they squandered okay well almost every single ounce of that lead going into into into halftime and then by I mean okay the second half things kind of evened out in South Carolina, they they they you know okay didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 and most of the time time okay okay time they were up by like six or something like that but it felt comfortable well you know in in in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but a uh so lot of of of good performances from a lot of different areas and as uh like much as we've talked talked talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
