Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the the you know topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I mean and I got an email here from a client of mine that I've um been been coaching for is probably since late last year by eight eight nine months. Okay. I guess. Guess. I've been coaching him now. Well maybe longer so he sent me uh this email email and he's got a couple of situations that he's asking me about so he okay he basically he meets his All at a concert and I guess his group like and her group of friends friends kind of emerged at some point, and she listened well this. She says that she told told him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
