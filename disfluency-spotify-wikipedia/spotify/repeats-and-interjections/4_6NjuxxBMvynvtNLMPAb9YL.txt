Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release like uh uh uh release release release release for me, it's all about the music and I I mean so you know you know forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography choreography choreography choreography choreography and I don't even uh you know okay so think about it being a workout. I just listened to to to to to the um so okay well songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower shower so so I mean so shower shower shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training like I mean so well gym, I I I I I just try and listen to the music as many so I mean so okay times as possible, but I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm not even thinking about the lesson well okay um okay was broken all the work out. It's just just just just just filled music and so I mean well um what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out out out out I mean you know so well out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's that's that's that's um okay you know I mean that's going to be or when it will be but it just happens after you well okay you know I mean you you you you listen to it for a while and then when you actually um like okay well then go right let's plug plug plug plug plug in and learn the well I mean uh um choreography when those two things come together and you you you you you teach um um you know okay your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or so like like you know little little little little little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
