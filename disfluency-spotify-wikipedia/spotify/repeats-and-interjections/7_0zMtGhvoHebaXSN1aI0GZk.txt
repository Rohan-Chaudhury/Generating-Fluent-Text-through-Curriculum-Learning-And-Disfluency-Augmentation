It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a okay you know so I mean well okay you know small small small small small small small small range Lucas is important for respiration um well you know uh like uh I mean respiration releases The energy needed by every living living living living living living living so I mean okay like so so um living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy well um I mean I mean well like well energy energy energy energy energy energy energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have okay you know I mean okay uh I mean okay a negative impact on on on on on on on on osmosis, which is the I mean so I mean well you know so you know movement of water between cells by affecting concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration concentration so so you know uh you know so you know gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a a so like well well you know okay uh a a a a a a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the uh so you know so like you know I mean concentration of blood glucose is too high high high high high high high high the uh um you know well okay um uh pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect detect well um um you know well like okay detect detect detect detect detect detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose uh okay well you know like you know so into glycogen glycogen as as as as as as as as a form of so well um okay um like okay glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this this this this this you know so um uh well um I mean this this this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. Well um um like uh you know like. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
