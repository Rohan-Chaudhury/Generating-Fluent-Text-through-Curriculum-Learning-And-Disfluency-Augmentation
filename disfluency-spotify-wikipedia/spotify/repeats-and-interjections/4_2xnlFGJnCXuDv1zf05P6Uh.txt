What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk um you know so you know about about about about about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of uh um you know uh the Plaid mode Model S and and and and and plasmid model X on Tesla so you know you know uh by this is something I'm really really excited about from from from from from so so well like a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third uh like like so third third third third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. Uh uh uh uh. We were just just just just just recording and we're talking about this I mean you know I mean like new track package that came out for the model 3. 3 3 3 3. It's uh you know um well like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new okay so um okay new new new new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost so okay so uh 60 Grand and then you you you you you pay five and a half so uh well uh Grand more for these new tires and these these these these these brake pads which you know like like okay are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's It's It's It's like you know um uh It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I uh like um so was just just just just just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla uh you know you know uh as sort of this luxury luxury luxury luxury luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of um like you know like these fancy new features and services that sort of of of of of Die well okay so so Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is is is is well I mean um well is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
