I actually I actually didn't have the mic in my hand. So. I I so got a fat callus on my hand right now. Sorry, I like sandpaper. It's uh It's all right. But yeah, so sorry about that long break we took we so were just just really busy with midterms papers. We went on a Hiatus we just were like busy. Yeah. Sorry, Sorry, not a Hiatus. That means we're like temporarily broken up. It's a short break. Okay spotty spotty neck.
