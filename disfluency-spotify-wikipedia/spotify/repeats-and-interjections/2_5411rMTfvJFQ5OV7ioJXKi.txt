I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 I mean um 7888 recovered and and and in the United States. We have now passed the so like hundred Mark. We're not at one. One one. 102 cases confirmed with six deaths all you know you know happening in Washington, which is interesting that that that we haven't had any well you know deaths in California.
