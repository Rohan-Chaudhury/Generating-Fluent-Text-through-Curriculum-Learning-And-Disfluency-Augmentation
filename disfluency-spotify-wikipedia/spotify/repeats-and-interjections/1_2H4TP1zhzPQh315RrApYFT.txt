You are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. I'm going like going to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met well met let's see here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's okay hard to to believe that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of well that that kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when so we get together. Together. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't like chatted in a while, while, but it was really great to record this episode. She so has spent the last several years years studying herbs. Actually, she was already well pretty into it whenever I met her and she she has spent uh all these years doing that. So she's going to share some of of her um knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have to apologize like apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I need to do before you know I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
