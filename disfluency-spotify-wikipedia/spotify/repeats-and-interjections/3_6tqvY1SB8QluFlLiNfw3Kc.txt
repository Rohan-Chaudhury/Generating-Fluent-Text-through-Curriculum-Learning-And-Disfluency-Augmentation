Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires fires fires so um uh fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in I mean you know uh in in in first place of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still I mean uh like still still still in first place due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that okay like okay that that that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would make the like well well most sense, but of course course course course not listen, I don't care if technically um okay you know they're not in first. All I I I I care about is when you um um okay look at the points it is tied. This very very very very moment I mean I mean well and just the fact that that is the situation we are discussing right now like so well is is is is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the I mean well so Carolina Hurricanes four four four four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
