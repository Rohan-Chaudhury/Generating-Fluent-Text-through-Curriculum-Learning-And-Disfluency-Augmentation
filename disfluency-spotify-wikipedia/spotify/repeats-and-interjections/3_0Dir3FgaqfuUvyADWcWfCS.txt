Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for um uh I mean for for for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie um I mean so the original old school school school school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about well um okay this one. It was one of my mother's mother's mother's mother's favorite. So I think like okay so it was one of the first ones she saw saw saw saw in the okay well like theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was about about uh um okay about about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems uh um uh wildly inappropriate. Inappropriate inappropriate inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling well um well yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
