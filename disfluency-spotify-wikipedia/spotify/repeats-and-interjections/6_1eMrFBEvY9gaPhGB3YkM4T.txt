I like uh so so I mean okay was was was was was was was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some well I mean well I mean uh like messed up organism right in front front front front front front front of my eyes. I so well you know I mean you know um just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. Again again again again uh uh I mean um so you know again again. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use I mean you know I mean um well you know the small lamp lamp lamp lamp lamp lamp lamp on the table next I mean so you know I mean you know you know to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Here here like I mean well you know so um here here here here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first you know uh well like like okay rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing traumatizing me. It didn't okay like I mean uh well so do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. Shift shift shift you know you know I mean well uh um shift shift shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I um I mean I mean like like okay could see see see see see see see movement in my peripheral vision.
