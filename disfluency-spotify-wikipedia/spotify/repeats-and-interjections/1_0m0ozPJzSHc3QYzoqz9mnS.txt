The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls girls that well were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking asking me uh how we do it how we get it out there how we record record it. I mean. And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor uh which if if we would have had when we first started out this well would have been way way way easier and it's much easier. It is I mean now gotten super easy, you you know, so anchor is by far the easiest way well to make a podcast it gives gives you everything you need. In one place so like you don't have to get Pro Tools or any any fancy recording equipment or anything I mean and you can literally make a podcast and and edit it on your um phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives gives you all the creation okay tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good good which you know, if we like didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
