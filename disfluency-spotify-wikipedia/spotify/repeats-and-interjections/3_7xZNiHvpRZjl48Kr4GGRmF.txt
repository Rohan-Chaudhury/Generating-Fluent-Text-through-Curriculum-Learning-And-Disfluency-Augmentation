I want us to talk so well okay about before we talk about like like like like life. So last episode we both talked um uh so about how we were reading the Jessica Simpson Simpson Simpson Simpson book okay you know so open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have to say anything anything I mean uh um anything anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell me like like okay if if if if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading uh so well Jessica's back home - - - - if I were John Mayer, I would so so so be under a rock right now. I I I I even went to his Instagram account. You know you know um. I don't follow him just to see if people people people people were commenting. That's like okay I mean like the rabbit hole. I went down when I read this but but but but you know so okay that bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram because I don't don't okay I mean so don't don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
