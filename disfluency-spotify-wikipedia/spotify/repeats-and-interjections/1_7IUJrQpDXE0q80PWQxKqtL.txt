Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about about uh the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor to okay to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, well too often often finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And okay then if we do do find them then on the other side of the world or uh is too expensive or or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people so now for over 30 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start like of this year. I've been been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how um I can help more more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship so group here. Here. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You uh can ask ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world you know for a fraction of of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
