Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really really appreciate your like support. I hope you're getting a lot out of of studying the Bible in like this way by looking at the literal sense of the the text, which is something well we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we we need to you know talk about it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting interesting passage. It's quite so unlike everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 17 1 okay to 9, which is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James James and his I mean brother John and led them up a high mountain where they they could like be alone. There in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
