You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film film television so and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to to you know work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine I mean for an an hour a day or weeks on end depending on the project okay those clients might might be directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the like project now our our work. On the project we talked about a whole bunch so of interesting things. Sometimes Sometimes it's color but not necessarily and that is what the well color couch is all all about. It's a glimpse behind the curtain of film um and television the podcast will talk talk about color from time to time, but so it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
