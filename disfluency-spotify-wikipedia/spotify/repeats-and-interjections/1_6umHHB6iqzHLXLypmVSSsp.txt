Hello friends, thank you for listening in today the theme of this first episode like in in a series is one that I consider really foundational as you know, my goal with like with pondering purple is to help missionaries kids and the people who love them I mean to better understand the the complexities that drive us the gifts and the challenges I mean the joys and the frustrations frustrations of growing up in a multicultural Ministry focused so and complicated environment. Ain't there was a time time when I wasn't aware of you know the differences that came from growing up between worlds and of of the push and well pull of the happy and the hard then I I went to a school for okay missionaries kids in Germany when I was in ninth grade, grade, and I quickly came uh to realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite been been able to put so a finger on we're not just in me my friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
