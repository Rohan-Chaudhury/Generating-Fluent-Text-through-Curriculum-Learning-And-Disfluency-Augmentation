The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that so well were were were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking um well me how we do do do it how we get it out there how we like uh record it. And you know, know, know, thankfully I was able to tell them like um about anchor which if we would have had had had when we first started out like well this would have been way way easier and it's much much much easier. It you know well is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far far um well far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you you okay okay you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any any I mean uh any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit uh okay edit edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So okay okay it gives you all all all the creation tools. You need to edit it uh um to make it sound good which you you you know, if we didn't have a you know uh background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
