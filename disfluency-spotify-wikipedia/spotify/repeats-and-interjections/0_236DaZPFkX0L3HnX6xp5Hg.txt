Hello friends and welcome to another episode of the John cast we are back it is nearly 2 p.m. And I am still in my pajamas that is not on account of laziness that is actually on account of the fact that I have been working really really hard today been editing some stuff right now sweet bear and I we are in South Carolina and we have some friends coming down here to meet. Eat us in a few days. It's one of our good friends. It's her birthday and so will kind of be taking Thursday most of Thursday and some of Friday off. So I'm actually recording this on a Wednesday. And so today was like my big day to kind of get ahead on everything so that I can unplug a little bit and be fully present with sweet bear and our friends to celebrate big shout out to Rebecca. It is your birthday. I think tomorrow by the time this comes out.
