Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires fires uh I mean you know so um I mean fires fires fires fires fires are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington okay so um okay I mean uh Capitals in first place of the the the the the the the Metropolitan. Well, technically you know like like so um I mean I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the tiebreak, tiebreak, um you know so um you know okay tiebreak, tiebreak, tiebreak, tiebreak, tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it so like okay you know I mean um the tiebreaker because that would make the the the the the the the most sense, but um well well okay like uh of course not listen, I don't care if technically they're not not not not uh uh um well so you know not not not in first. All I care about is when you look at the you know uh um okay okay well points it it it it it it it is tied. This very moment and just like like so well like you know the fact that that is the situation we are discussing right right right right right I mean so uh so like you know right right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina you know well uh okay I mean so Hurricanes four four four four four four four to one on a second half of a well like well um well so back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
