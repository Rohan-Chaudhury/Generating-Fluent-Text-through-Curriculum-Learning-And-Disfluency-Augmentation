It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within within within uh uh I mean within a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed needed so I mean well needed needed by every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce I mean like so enough enough enough enough energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This uh uh well can have a negative impact impact impact impact on osmosis, which is the movement of I mean um uh water between cells by affecting concentration gradients gradients gradients gradients as blood flows through so well like the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high high high high concentration. Enough I mean I mean uh blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas pancreas pancreas pancreas okay well well releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence presence uh um so presence presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of uh so I mean glucose glucose glucose glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Well um um. Use this process continues until the the the the pancreas detects a normal um okay so blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
