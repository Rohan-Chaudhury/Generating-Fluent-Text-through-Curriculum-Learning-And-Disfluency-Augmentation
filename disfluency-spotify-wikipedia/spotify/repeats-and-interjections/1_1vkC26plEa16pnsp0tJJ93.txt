Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your host Justin Boon to to you know leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this like on Monday Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a I mean couple days to digest digest some of the performances from the skill position players um and that's what we're going to talk talk about today the offense of risers and well fallers from the combine. And I I know I said this on uh last week's show but I have to reiterate you you cannot freak out you know about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I I so mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're they're / like fractions like of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your your view of I mean a player but we did learn some things some players had much better better uh showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
