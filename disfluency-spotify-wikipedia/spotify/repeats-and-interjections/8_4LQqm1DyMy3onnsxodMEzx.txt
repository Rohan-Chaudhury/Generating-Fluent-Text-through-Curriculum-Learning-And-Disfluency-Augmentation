That's right. I'm back with another episode of med school radio and we're looking at okay okay um okay um I mean so uh at at at at at at at at some more educational objectives. Let's get well okay um well like so uh um right to it starting with fragile X syndrome. Syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome like so you know well uh I mean so I mean syndrome. What is this caused by this is caused by an increased number of cgg um I mean so so well so so um trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide trinucleotide repeats on the fragile X. Mental I mean uh um uh well okay um like retardation Gene and that is fmr1 on the long arm arm arm arm arm arm so okay like so you know okay um okay arm arm arm of the X chromosome and this leads to hyper methylation and inactivation like well so you know well so well uh of fmr1. Fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1 fmr1. So remember these cgg trinucleotide like um I mean um you know I mean uh you know repeats fragile X mental retardation fmr1 gene on the long arm. Leading to hypermethylation and.
