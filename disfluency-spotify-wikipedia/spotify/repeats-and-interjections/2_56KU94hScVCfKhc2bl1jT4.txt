I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible so uh in in in this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which like uh is is is something we don't often talk about enough, but we need to we uh uh need to talk talk talk about it more and today we're looking at. Like I mean. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. Else else. We see so like in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is the the the Transfiguration. Jesus uh okay Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them um you know them them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence uh you know he he he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
