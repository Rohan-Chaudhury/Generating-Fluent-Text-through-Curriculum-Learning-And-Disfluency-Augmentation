Amen was called called called a mind all those we promise to pray for. I like like think the most exhilarating truth truth truth is that before the world was um uh created God already had you and I in in in mind each with our so uh own particular place in the grand plan of history that no no no other um well person can or ever will take we were designed for this role and I mean so only only only we can fulfill it and if we don't no one will well like Father favor and his spiritual spiritual spiritual conferences rights. No two of us are alike. God so I mean saw a specialty in US eternally, eternally, eternally, it was this specialty which he loved it is this specialty which decides our place and our work and his creation.
