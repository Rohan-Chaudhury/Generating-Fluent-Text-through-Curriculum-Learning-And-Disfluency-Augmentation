Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope uh you guys guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this like episode starts. Starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of uh this podcast is called called catch open me at the time that I started this so podcast. I thought you know, what what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random you know stuff, you know catch up up with me sounds like a good title. But then um as I recorded the past past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure well out what the theme of this this podcast should be. So if you know notice so a lot of the things that that we covered from the past few like episode is about mental health growing up up and things we deal with as well a teenager or as a young adult. So So with that said the new I mean title of the podcast will be basically growing up. Up. I finally figure out okay what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing growing up is like going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically basically having them share well what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
