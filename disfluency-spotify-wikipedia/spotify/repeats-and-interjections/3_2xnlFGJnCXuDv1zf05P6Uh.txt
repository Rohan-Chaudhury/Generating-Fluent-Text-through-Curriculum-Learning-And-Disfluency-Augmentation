What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about about okay okay well about about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode so uh I mean Model S and and and and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is so um well something I'm really really excited about about about about from a financial perspective. So okay so you know going to nerd out on this shout out to the the the the third you know you know like row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just just so um uh just just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out uh I mean uh for the the the the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can so so like basically get these these these these really cool looking new tire. Hours for um uh I mean your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand Grand Grand Grand and then you I mean uh um pay five and a half Grand more for these new new new new tires so so I mean and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the the the uh like um the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I okay you know you know I I I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort um you know well of this luxury luxury luxury luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these well okay you know fancy new features and services that sort sort sort sort of Die Hard fans uh well so and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, um like okay example, example, example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
