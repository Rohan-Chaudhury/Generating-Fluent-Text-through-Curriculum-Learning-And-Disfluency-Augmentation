Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release release for uh me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I I forget the I mean choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I I just listened uh to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Time. Like um when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the the laundry so when I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many many times I mean as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work work out. I mean. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics lyrics or stand out well all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know know what that's going to I mean be or when it will be but it just happens after you you listen to it like for a while and then when you actually then go right right let's plug I mean in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and and you okay teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son son or okay little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
