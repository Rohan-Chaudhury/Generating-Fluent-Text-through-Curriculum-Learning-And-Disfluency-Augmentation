I want us to talk about before I mean okay we we we talk about like life. So last episode we both talked about how so I mean we were reading reading reading the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question you know you know is no spoilers. We don't don't don't have to say anything in case you well okay haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell tell tell me if you well I mean would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's Jessica's Jessica's back home like um - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right right right I mean I mean now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just to see I mean I mean see see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down like like down down when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I well so went to his his his Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
