Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with so you know your your your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for I mean you know tuning in in in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into like so the who what why when and how how how of this podcast. So before so so you decide to listen to me, let me at least least least help you know I mean you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about 5 years years years um so now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a nursing home um you know home home from there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting so so working at at at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private I mean you know Practice World, which which which is really where I wanted to be I was able like well to sit with with with people for longer periods of time we set realistic I mean so goals, we had follow-ups and we were were were able to see each other for um you know a bit more than five or ten minutes and you're you're you're working in the you know um clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes in between between between the okay I mean doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've been here here okay like here for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
