Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was was um I mean was very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism um you know right in front front front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we you know so reading the rules again. Again again. And again, it was so dark in I mean you know here that I had to use the small lamp lamp lamp on the table uh you know next to me. They really need to fix the lights lights lights here. Yeah, uh okay I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than than okay uh than traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a like well great shift. Shift shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out like I mean but I could see see see movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer you know I mean as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
