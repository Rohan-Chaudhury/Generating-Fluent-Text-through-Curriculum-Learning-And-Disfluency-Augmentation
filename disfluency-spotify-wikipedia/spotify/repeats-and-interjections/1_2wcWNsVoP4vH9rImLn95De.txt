So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, like I I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach you know because because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about well parenting and how hard hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had so allowed myself to fall fall into this pattern of just beating myself up in a really so unhelpful. A way, which which I know better than to do but I just kind like of got caught caught in a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my well coach said said something to me so very profound and the shift that uh it has created since then then has been so powerful that he just knew that uh I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
