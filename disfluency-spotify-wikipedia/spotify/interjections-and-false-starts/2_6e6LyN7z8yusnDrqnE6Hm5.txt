Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 13 of the more, you know podcast. Like I mean. This is no l am speaking. And today. I'm going to talk about giving up Perfection uh so or this idea of perfection for progress. And for peace. I think I think that uh you know it's it's where we find peace when we accept that. We are we are we are imperfect like Just it's like like The Human Condition. I want you to know that every single person on planet Earth uh uh is not getting it. All right, they may look like they're getting it right because there's I mean so maybe one facet of their life that they're really focused on and really paying a well well lot of attention to but I'm gonna guarantee like seriously, I'm gonna guarantee that well you know there's other parts of their lives that are sacrificing because of it, right I look at life now is.
