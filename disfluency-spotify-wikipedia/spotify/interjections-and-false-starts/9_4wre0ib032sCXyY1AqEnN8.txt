Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or try um I mean okay so you know you know well I mean um to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going on like I mean okay I mean I mean you know okay you know like in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast like okay you know okay you know so uh uh okay is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being real being okay uh well well I mean um I mean okay so vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the opposite. We believe you know okay okay you know so like okay I mean so that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to grow through our struggle so um you know so I mean you know um okay well and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder that in our Darkest Hours okay like okay like so um I mean uh um when we can't see the way out when our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
