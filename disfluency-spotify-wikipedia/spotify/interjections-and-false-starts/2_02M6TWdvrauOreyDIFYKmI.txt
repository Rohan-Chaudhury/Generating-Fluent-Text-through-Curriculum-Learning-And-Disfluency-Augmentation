I well so made a mistake on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the well you know meme she put out and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it you know well that I said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big like uh difference, but You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to you know well set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
