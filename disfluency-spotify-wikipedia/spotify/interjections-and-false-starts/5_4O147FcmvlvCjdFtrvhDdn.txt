Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if um well I mean you know okay you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that like okay um like I mean Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description so I mean um I mean uh and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly I mean uh you know so you know going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley okay well I mean uh like was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was like uh okay you know uh filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be I mean uh uh I mean I mean the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have uh you know well like uh been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all I mean well you know um like have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's you know so like uh okay all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare like I mean I mean well okay Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out okay uh so um um on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show so okay so well so live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
