Well well like you know um maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got a couple of situations that he's uh um uh I mean asking me about so he basically he meets his All at a concert and I guess you know um okay uh his group and her group of friends kind of emerged at some point, you know I mean well like and she listened this.
