Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode today's episode today's episode today's episode is when did disability become so taboo? So okay I mean you know I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a fitness influencer and so like you know also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she came to be disabled you know so like or to have a disability. And also the way that the World perhaps disables us you know you know like more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do which might seem like you know um um a confusing concept. Act but act but act but act but it's basically the idea of ableism and how the okay uh like world is set up for people who are able-bodied as opposed to those of you know well so us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. It was so inspiring okay you know um to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting conversation. I really I really I really I really well so okay hope you enjoy it as always.
