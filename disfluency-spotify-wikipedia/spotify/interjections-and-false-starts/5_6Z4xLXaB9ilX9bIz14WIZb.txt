Traveling from Pittsburgh to the Pacific Ocean wasn't easy, especially when you were doing it in a well like I mean I mean like Dugout canoe on the 9th of June 27th, 1805. The men of Lewis and Clark's so so you know uh uh Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the banks of the Missouri uh you know you know okay I mean River. It was it was it was it was it was it was a welcome respite after a long day of traveling the sleeping men were okay um well I mean I mean so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in their midst. Um so okay okay well. Under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured by bison meat well well you know so so that had been hung up to dry. If it decided it wanted to snack you know okay I mean like I mean on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware of the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
