Good morning, everyone Welcome to our Friday spending time with Jesus podcast today. I wanted so like uh us to look at Romans chapter 1 the entire book of Romans is um okay um jam-packed with Theology and interesting thoughts and just like amazing Epic. Ders that okay um well people quote all the time and Romans chapter 1 is really no different and Romans 1 I mean well okay we're dealing with our sexuality. We're dealing with idolatry. We're dealing with the question of you know um so is the law of God really written on the human heart no matter where they're at. No so I mean okay matter where they've grown up or what they've heard all their lives and it's an incredible I mean well um chapter it lists out all the ways that we can act basically in so I mean so sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that.
