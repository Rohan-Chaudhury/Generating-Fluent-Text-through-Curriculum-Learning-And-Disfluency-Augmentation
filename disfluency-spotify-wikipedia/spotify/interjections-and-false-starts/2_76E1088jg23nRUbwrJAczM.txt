Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be you know well explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more so um masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is so uh such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control I mean um their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in I mean you know control of what they would like and as a man this is important to your I mean you know success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you okay you know want to become a man of value so that way other men or other people in uh uh general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's okay um the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a okay uh person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not you know well going to do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little so I mean bit to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take so like five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
