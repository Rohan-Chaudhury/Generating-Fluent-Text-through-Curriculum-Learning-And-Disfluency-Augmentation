The NFL combine is over. We're recording this on you know um well um like Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple days like well um like so to digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what um um so okay um we're going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. You know okay like I mean you know. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to you know uh like well well reiterate you cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are these are these are these are these are these are I mean like so like like Incredibly talented athletes. I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, um well well like um but they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your so well you know um okay view of a player but we did learn some things some players had much so you know so so I mean better showing than others. So I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
