The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay emerged well uh I mean to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading shockingly racist DMS okay you know well that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully but both fans of uh okay you know the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation so so well fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake you know well you know and eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious well so I mean username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and like okay like the show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The like I mean so Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. Like uh I mean. The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. Uh um like. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season you know I mean well there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then well like well confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
