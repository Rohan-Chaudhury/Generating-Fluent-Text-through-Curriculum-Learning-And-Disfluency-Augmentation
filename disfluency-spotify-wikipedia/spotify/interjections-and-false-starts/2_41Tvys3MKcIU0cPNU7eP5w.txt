Yo, yo, yo, what's up everyone? I guess I'll kick off this podcast addressing um um probably the biggest talk in sports right now. Tom Brady greatest of all time Now I mean so if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you that he's staying so uh put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying put it just doesn't um you know make sense for me for? Somebody like somebody like somebody like him somebody that has been in um well the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one team uh I mean just doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense to me. So it I mean okay doesn't make sense to me for this man the go out and play you know I mean for another team at 43 years old after spending his entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just it just it just doesn't make sense for.
