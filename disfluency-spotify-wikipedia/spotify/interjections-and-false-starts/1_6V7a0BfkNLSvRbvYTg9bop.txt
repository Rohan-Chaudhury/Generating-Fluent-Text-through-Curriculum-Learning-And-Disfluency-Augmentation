Hi guys, welcome to the dead by tomorrow podcast. My name my name is Daniel winter okay and my co-host is Andrew Monroe in each episode. We're going we're going to explore so topics that are too important to wait until your last day on Earth as uh we introduce each topic. We encourage you to remember that some tomorrow will be your well last so each new day could be your final chance to really live. This um week we'll be covering introductions for Daniel and I where the idea for the uh podcast came from and some of our topics moving forward. Thanks for listening. Okay, well okay, well Andrew, what would you do if you were going to die tomorrow? If I was okay going to die tomorrow? I would probably do something involving being shirtless for starters so and hopefully something memorable at the same time. You know, you know, I've got this idea in my head of that scene from that movie. I can't remember where the guy.
