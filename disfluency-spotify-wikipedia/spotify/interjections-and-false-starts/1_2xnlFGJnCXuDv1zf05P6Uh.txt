What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk uh about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model um S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really I mean really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout um out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We I mean were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the okay model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these okay really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost um 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new um tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on uh the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. So. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort um of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services you know that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and um the track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
