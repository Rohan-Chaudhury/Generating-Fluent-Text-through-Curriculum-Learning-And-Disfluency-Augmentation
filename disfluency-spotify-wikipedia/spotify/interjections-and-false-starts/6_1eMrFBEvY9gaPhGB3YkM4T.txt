Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very I mean uh um well okay I mean traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of I mean you know um okay um you know my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. I mean okay so uh I mean okay. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small you know um okay you know um um lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the I mean okay you know um like so lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. You know you know well um well I mean. Hopefully other hopefully other hopefully other hopefully other hopefully other hopefully other hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be I mean I mean okay you know like like a great shift. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see I mean well okay okay you know uh movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
