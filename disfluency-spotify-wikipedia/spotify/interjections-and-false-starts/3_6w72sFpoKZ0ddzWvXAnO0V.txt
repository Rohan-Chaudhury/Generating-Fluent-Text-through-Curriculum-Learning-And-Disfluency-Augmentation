Perhaps the perhaps the perhaps the perhaps the most deceptively titled episode The Origin of Species was not actually about the well you know I mean fucking word genus species. But back to chapter 24 to see what it actually well you know um is about today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to biology for bastards teaching well you know you know biology and the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John Doe well um uh D. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter at a like so so time this week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
