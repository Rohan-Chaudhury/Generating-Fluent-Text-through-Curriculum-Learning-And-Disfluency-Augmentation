Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if well so you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that I mean like Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in well um the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie so well was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire okay I mean Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Uh you know. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so you know like she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason okay well Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no uh like other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the like um comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if but if but if um well you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check uh um that out on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show okay like live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
