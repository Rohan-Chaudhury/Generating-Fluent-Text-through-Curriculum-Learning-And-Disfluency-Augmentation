Hi everyone. Welcome back to skincare Somali A's your favorite bi-weekly skincare podcast. I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay so so Natalie and I'm Jessica this week. We are talking about what we I like you know I mean I mean to call the great exfoliation debate because we've got two different points of view and I mean um I mean we're going to Duke it out. Mano a mano this week. We will also of uh uh I mean course do our wine pairing because we are your Somali A's and this week uh okay okay we're going with something a little bit more aggressive a little bit Bolder just like uh um um exfoliation. I would like to recommend Santa Julia winemakers Reserve Mountain blend. That is that is that is that is a Malbec and cab Franc blend from 2016. It's just a little bit.
