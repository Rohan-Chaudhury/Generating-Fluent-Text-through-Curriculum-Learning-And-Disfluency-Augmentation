And when and when and when and when and when you had gone up I mean well I mean uh to be with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter so well okay I mean comes to him and he says to him we've been looking for you and uh I mean I mean um Jesus says while I needed to be with the father but also need to uh you know I mean well go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It like you know well I mean is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being you know okay so uh with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
