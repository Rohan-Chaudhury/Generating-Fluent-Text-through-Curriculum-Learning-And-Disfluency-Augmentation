Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree and I well well so became good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal State Long Beach uh you know okay Bree was actually taken the course because she was preparing to apply to occupational therapy you know okay I mean school. She has recently been admitted and we are so proud of her Bree also has okay I mean uh a background in kinesiology, which is what she studied for her undergraduate major and when so so um she was still studying that she also played basketball NCAA Division II so so like at Cal State East Bay. So this so this so this so this woman has a lot of knowledge about not well well so only how to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. We're going to uh so like dive into some of the ways in which she's faced some really tough situations uh you know you know and she's had to pull out that inner strength to keep going in the face well um like of some situations where she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
