What is up guys? This is Stu is what the fuck Jim talk. So I I mean well made a post the other day about the you know, I even made a podcast like um it was probably one or two podcast back now from here maybe but well so about you know, your gym not being the best our today, you know, well like I think it should be more of a pillar of the schedule and I made so I mean this Instagram post and I dropped it in a couple of Philly at so I mean owners groups. And anyway, obviously you can imagine the feedback was was was mixed and like uh one individual this Rob he owns a gym. I believe it's called CrossFit rise again. I um well apologize Rob if I'm fucking that up. You know, you know, you know, he shot me a DM and well like you just like bro. I don't I don't agree. I think I think I think this argument is um so pointless. I don't get it. You should strive to do both like and he just didn't agree uh so with it which was but he reached out to me and show me a DM like so and I do what I typically do when I hit him with an audio message okay uh and explain my position and you know next thing, you know, we're back and I mean I mean forth with a few audio messages and the guy, you know, we're we went from adversarial to you know, I probably go get a beer the.
