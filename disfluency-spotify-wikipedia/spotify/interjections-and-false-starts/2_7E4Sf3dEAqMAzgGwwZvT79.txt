Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this and this and this is my video coaching newsletter and okay you know the topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I mean okay I got an email here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for is so okay probably since late last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been coaching him um well now. Well maybe well maybe well maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got a well well couple of situations that he's asking me about so he basically he meets his All like so at a concert and I guess his group and her group of friends kind of um well emerged at some point, and she listened this. She says that she told him to text I mean you know her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
