Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, uh um I mean so um so there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me well like okay you know okay like that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us uh um uh well well you know in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed to sit on a uh okay well I mean you know well couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance so so okay uh okay uh on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. Like um uh I mean uh you know. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they okay uh well uh okay uh just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but um so so like you know like when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
