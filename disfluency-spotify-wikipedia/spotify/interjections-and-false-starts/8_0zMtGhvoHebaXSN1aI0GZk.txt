It is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within well well um so you know like so so a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every um okay I mean I mean uh okay like you know living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy so well um okay I mean well so so if blood glucose levels are too high. This can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can have a negative impact I mean um like so okay I mean okay well on osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as okay so so I mean um like so you know blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a I mean you know okay okay um okay you know so high concentration. Enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the like okay like like like um uh I mean pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues like so you know I mean so okay well you know detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as uh uh like um well um um um a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this so you know okay uh well like um well process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
