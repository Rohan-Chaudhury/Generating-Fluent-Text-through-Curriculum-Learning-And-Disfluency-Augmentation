I reported uh um I mean that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link you know okay I mean in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie like well uh was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because I mean like like Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get okay like well this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the I mean well so Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any like I mean well other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I well okay um see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your I mean like so thoughts down in the comments below. That's all that's all that's all that's all I've got for today so I mean so on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I you know um um just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check so check so check so check that out like okay uh on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show like I mean okay live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV.
