It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that like like okay uh like you know, you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t so so you know you know you know have a conversation. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're I mean I mean I mean like uh just here to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So you so you so you so you so you so you know um okay well. So it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that well okay so uh like question, you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it um I mean like like so was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful well I mean um um okay ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally okay I mean I mean uh um useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah you know uh uh I mean well blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
