You are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. I'm going to well I mean like be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's see like so okay here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to believe that like I mean uh now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of all of all of all of that you know you know so kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. You know um like. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a while, I mean well um but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent um so so the last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever uh so okay I met her and she has spent all these years doing that. So you know like you know she's going to share some of her knowledge of herbs and we had a like uh like really good discussion. I have to apologize that I have not figured out uh I mean um yet, which I need to do before I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
