Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl uh okay Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he do I mean you know you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? like so Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl uh like duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you that you that you have to learn especially when doing okay okay gcses and a-levels. So I so I so I have some days where I meant to be in um well three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have uh um ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
