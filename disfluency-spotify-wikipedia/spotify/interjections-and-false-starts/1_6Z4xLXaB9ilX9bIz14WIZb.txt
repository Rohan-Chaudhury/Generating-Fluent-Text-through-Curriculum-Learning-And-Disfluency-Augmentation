It was a welcome respite after a long day of traveling the sleeping like men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder was in their midst. Under I under I mean the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into Camp lured by bison meat that had like been hung up to dry. If it if it decided it wanted to snack on uh some humans. There would there would be no stopping it unaware of the looming danger so the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
