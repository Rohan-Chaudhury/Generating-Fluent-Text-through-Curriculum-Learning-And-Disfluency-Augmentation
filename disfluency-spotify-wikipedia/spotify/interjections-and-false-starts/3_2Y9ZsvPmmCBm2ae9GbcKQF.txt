Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss I miss I miss I miss you guys. Hope like okay um you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this like you know well episode starts. I just I just I just I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this like uh I mean podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I okay okay I mean thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, uh well so you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I so okay like recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the I mean I mean I mean theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of okay you know I mean the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and um uh I mean things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So with so with so with so with that said like okay I mean the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I finally figure out like um I mean what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up is going to be I mean I mean I mean having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them share what they think is important uh okay okay for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
