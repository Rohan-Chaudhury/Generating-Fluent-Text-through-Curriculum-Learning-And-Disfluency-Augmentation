So today we are recording the first episode you know I mean of the podcast that we've been talking about recording for at least two or so okay three months. He has smelt a long story short may not going to be in um um touch for a while and I made not for sample cups of coffee on the you know you know lisburn road and we thought that the ideas and the conversation we were having may like so help a few older. So this is all very much part in those thoughts like so into action. And if and if and if we can help at least one other person as a uh like byproduct of our conversations recording and Publishing it then we think this is like I mean a very valuable form to do. So, so first of all, we're just going to well I mean basically introduce ourselves so you can get to know us that more about who you I mean um actually listened to and then down the line move very much want to so like delve into some of those deeper questions that may help others. So just by well uh where personal introduction my name is Asha Monaghan. I'm from a gallon which is about 10 minutes from the organ.
