If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes okay okay like like like like in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened it. I you know like I mean like I mean well was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you saying all uh okay like okay um um is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that habit you know like well I mean um okay of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And so so so you know um you know okay okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels um so so okay okay uh and we want to remind you that that there is a stream of well-being which you well um so uh so okay are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason are um like I mean okay uh okay standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that stream of well-being because you know um you know well okay um not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so you is so you know um okay you know like well painful from that painful place. That's always that's always that's always that's always that's always that's always that's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
