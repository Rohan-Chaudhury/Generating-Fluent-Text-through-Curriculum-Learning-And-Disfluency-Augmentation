This you this you know is the second ever podcast I've ever made. So I so I hope this isn't like too horrible and still trying to find my feet. So I hope you are you know bear with the bad editing in places. I've done my best to fix stuff well and re-recorded sections that were terrible. Anyway, let's anyway, let's get on with the show in uh this show. I cover I cover recent news and questions that I've been asked by the community. So. I then spend the rest of the show focus on a conversation about maniples the basic so building blocks of the game. I was intending to spend some time discussing uh how to use them as narrative devices, but following some feedback and realizing have well a lot of Basic Ground to cover I'll be focusing on the man of courses um primarily from gaming perspective. This is a longer episode than I initially planned and you'll um probably notice a slight change in Styles throughout the main section of the shug. So. This week work was a lot busier than I was expecting and much for my normal recording time was taken by.
