Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really um um like appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in I mean um so this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we don't uh uh I mean often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about it more so uh so and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. We um well you know see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is the transfiguration. Like uh like. Jesus Took jesus Took jesus Took jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up you know so so a high mountain where they could be alone. There in there in there in there in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
