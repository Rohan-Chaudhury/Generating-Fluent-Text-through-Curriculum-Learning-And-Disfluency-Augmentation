Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for our you know well first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old school okay like one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was it was it was one of my so um mother's favorite. So I so I so I think it was one of the first ones she I mean okay saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was like I mean about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. But um so I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
