Hey guys, welcome to the ladder talk. This is John. It's been a while since we okay had episode with just me and Gerard So today we're going to have a discussion so about the ethics of flipping. Now the way we're defining flipping for the you know conversation today is just the selling of any shaving related item that's significantly marked okay up from the original price. We hope you enjoy the conversation and now onto um the episode. Hot cake flipping okay, if you can sell a Wolfman for $2,000 all the power to you. I don't know how to respond because.
