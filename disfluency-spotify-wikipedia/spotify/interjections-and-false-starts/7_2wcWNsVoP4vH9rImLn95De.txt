So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. Uh uh um uh you know you know well. And yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach you know I mean so I mean well okay um because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how I mean like okay like well okay uh hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into uh okay uh I mean well I mean I mean this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which you know I mean um you know okay so I mean I know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in like okay well so you know like I mean a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so well so well so well so well so well so well so well so my coach said something to well um like uh okay um I mean me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then um so you know so you know you know well has been so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
