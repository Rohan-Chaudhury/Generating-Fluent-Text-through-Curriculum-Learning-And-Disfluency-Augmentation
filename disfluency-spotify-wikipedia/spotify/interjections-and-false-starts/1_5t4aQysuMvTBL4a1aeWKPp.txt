From Vice from Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian Morgan's. This is the okay show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today we're looking at one I mean of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th century. It's a story like about for men and for women who are locked inside this enormous glass dome for well two years just to see what would happen. And as and as you'd imagine it all went uh a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started to get a bit uncomfortable okay rarely about the four to six month Mark. I think we all knew instinctively that if so ever anybody opened up physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
