Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was um very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in uh front of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules I mean again. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to like use the small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the you know lights here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other hopefully other than traumatizing like me. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. Okay. The first thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in uh my peripheral vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
