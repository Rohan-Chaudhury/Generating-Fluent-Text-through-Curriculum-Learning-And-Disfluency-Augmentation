We know that those cases are so so based in Washington state at a nursing home in Seattle. Most have occurred. The so you know number of infections in the United States overall have climbed past a hundred. They're scattered um I mean across 15. It's with it's with it's with 27 cases in Washington state alone. As I mentioned like I mean that states getting hit very hard, but it's not the only one the okay well nursing home outbreak apparently seated the first case in North Carolina and Wake County resident you know okay who had visited the Washington State nursing home tested positive but is in isolation at home and doing well.
