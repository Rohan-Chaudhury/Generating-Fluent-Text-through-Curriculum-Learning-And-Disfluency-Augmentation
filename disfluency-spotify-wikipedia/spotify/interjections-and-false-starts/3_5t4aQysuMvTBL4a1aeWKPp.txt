From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian Morgan's. This you know you know I mean is the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today you know um like we're looking at one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th like I mean like century. It's a story about for men and for women who are locked inside this enormous so um you know glass dome for two years just to see what would happen. And as you'd imagine it uh I mean okay all went a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started to well like like get a bit uncomfortable rarely about the four to six month Mark. I think we like like well all knew instinctively that if ever anybody opened up physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
