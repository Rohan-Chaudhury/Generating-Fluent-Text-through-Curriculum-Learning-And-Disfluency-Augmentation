Salute up, salute up, salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when but when but when when I get so like a release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the uh okay choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just I just I just listened to well I mean the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when like when like when I'm in the I mean I mean shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training so like gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm um um not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just it's just it's just I mean so filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand uh uh out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going I mean well to be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen well you know to it for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug um uh in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach your uh I mean already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or little hit uh well movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
