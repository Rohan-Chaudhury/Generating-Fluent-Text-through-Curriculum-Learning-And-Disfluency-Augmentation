Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the like uh things well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me well like that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us I mean so in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit uh so on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it okay okay and dance on it. Do not do not do not do WWF moves on it. It's for okay you know sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know like well they're not supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a well uh little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency okay uh to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
