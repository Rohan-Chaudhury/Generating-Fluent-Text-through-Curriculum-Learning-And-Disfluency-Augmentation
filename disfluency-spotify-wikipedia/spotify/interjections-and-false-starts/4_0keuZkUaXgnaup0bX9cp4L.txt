Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did so I mean well uh disability become so taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is like I mean well well a fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she okay well like I mean came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the World you know okay you know so perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may like you know so uh do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but act but act but act but act but it's basically the idea you know um uh um of ableism and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as well well so well opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. Uh so uh so uh so uh so uh so well you know. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting uh um I mean you know conversation. I really I really I really I really I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review um so you know um And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, hi guys, hi guys, hi guys, hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
