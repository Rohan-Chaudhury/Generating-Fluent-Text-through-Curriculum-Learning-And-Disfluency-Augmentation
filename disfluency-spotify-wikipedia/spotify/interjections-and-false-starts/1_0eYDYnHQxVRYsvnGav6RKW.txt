Thank you for listening uh by the way, but if you haven't heard about anchor it's the easiest way to uh make a podcast.

It's free. There's creation tools that allow you to like record and edit the podcast, right? Your phone your phone or your computer? You can have your you know fans leave messages. Thank you to those of you that have been doing that by the like way, keep them come and keep harassing us and anchor will distribute the podcast for so you and can be heard on Spotify Apple podcasts and a bunch more this so many um channels that are podcast is on some of them. I never I never even heard of so like it does the work for you and you can make money from your podcast with no minimum listenership. You can just hit the ground running.
