Welcome to the hottest take my name is Chris Ryan. I am joined by Jason well concepci√≥n Juliet Littman and David Shoemaker and David you have before. I know okay that we fought the Revolutionary War for a reason but what this country you know needs is a king. Oh my God now listen. Listen, I'm not saying we okay need a monarch with absolute power. I'm not saying we need to go um to some like Royal Dutch like diagnostic system. But look at England right so now how much better would our political discourse be if we would just elect the uh king for every like a decade every 10 years. Donald Trump donald Trump gets to be like king. But we have a like a boring-ass technocrat. Who's They're as prime minister okay is actually making the decision, right? So he's have a guy who's a so guy or a gal whose job is to go to NASCAR races and give like speeches and set off. The first the first fireworks on the fourth of July. If you want to figure out is what I want a figure, how did.
