Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release for um well like okay so uh me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the choreography and uh I mean well okay uh like I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to the songs okay um um so uh you know and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower okay um um uh okay I mean when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I well you know um you know okay so just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not I mean you know you know um okay like even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just filled you know I mean so um I mean well music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out okay I mean um well uh you know all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to be um well okay um um okay or when it will be but it just happens after you listen to it for a um like well I mean um um while and then when you actually then go right let's plug in and you know well so okay like I mean learn the choreography when those two things come together and you teach your well okay well I mean I mean so already naturally in the music. So those little moments that your son or like you know you know well like uh little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
