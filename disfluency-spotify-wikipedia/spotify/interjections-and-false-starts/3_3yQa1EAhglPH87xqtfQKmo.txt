Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic like okay so of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This is well um uh something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is uh so I mean you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going okay um you know to feel like things are going to work out in your favor. You're okay you're okay you're okay you're okay so so not always going to feel like you're doing the right thing someday is going to okay so you know be really great and you're going to be full of passion and feel inspired. Well um um. And other days it's going to feel hopeless and like things aren't working out so um you know and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your like like you know ear and your life telling you what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business uh well uh you want to build or that career you want to have is just well okay uh unrealistic for you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what uh um okay he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
