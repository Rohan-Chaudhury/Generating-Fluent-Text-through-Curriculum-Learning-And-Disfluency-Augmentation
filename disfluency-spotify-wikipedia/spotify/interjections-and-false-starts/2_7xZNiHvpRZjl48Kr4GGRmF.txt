Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I have just I mean you know some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk about like life. Like um. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica uh well Simpson book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have you know okay to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell okay okay me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back uh like home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. Um um. I even I even I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just to see uh so if people were commenting. That's like that's like that's like the rabbit hole. I went down when I read well you know this but that bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram because you know um I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
