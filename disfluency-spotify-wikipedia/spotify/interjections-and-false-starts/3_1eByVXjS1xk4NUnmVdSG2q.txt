The NHL is apparently unveiling a new Puck filled with Quote unquote electronics uh you know um and they're going to be testing out during the playoffs. This is this is this is this is the first time they're going so so you know to throw it in used at least that we know of so read a little article I mean so um about this AQ and we were just talking about this before we like uh I mean went live here. They've apparently they've apparently they've apparently they've apparently used this puck in a couple games during the regular season without um um well telling the teams or players that they were using it. They've given it to so so okay a few of the Superstar players throughout the league the practice with the like uh like see if they can notice anything feedback was generally positive. Of course only one player noticed some issues with it. No Sidney Crosby. He said he could notice.
