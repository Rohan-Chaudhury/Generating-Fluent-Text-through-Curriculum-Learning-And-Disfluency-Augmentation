Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, like like you know you know uh I mean so so uh um there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the uh well well okay so well um um okay you know kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in this uh okay so well okay like like I mean uh you know household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch um you know I mean um you know well okay so uh I mean not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance like um you know well I mean like so I mean um you know on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. Uh I mean um I mean I mean so um I mean like you know. So when so when so when so when so when so when so when so when so when so when so when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they um like you know so uh I mean I mean you know okay well just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch um okay um okay I mean you know okay so like uh them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking on the couch stop.
