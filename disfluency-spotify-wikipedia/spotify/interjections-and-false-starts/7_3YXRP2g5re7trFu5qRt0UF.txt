Okay so well uh I mean you know so. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to like like well okay I mean so um serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's like like uh I mean well okay like I mean we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know so okay well okay well so okay was a success not enough to sustain it.
