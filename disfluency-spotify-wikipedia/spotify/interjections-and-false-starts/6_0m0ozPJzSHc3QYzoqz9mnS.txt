The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were um um so okay you know well friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how so so well so I mean so we do it how we get it out there how we record it. Like I like I like I like I like I like I like I mean um so okay uh. And you and you and you and you and you and you and you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we uh okay I mean like you know I mean would have had when we first started out this would have been way uh well so like okay you know way easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor like so so um okay you know is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you you know you know so well you know like need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any like so like you know uh you know fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it um you know like like I mean um on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives so okay so like I mean well you all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound uh well I mean you know like uh good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
