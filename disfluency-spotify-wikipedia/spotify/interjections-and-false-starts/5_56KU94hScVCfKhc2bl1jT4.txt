Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really like well so like well appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in this so um you know you know well way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we don't um uh like okay so often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk okay well well you know okay about it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike like well um well like everything else. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which is the so well like like I mean Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up you know uh I mean okay uh a high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he was like well I mean uh you know transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
