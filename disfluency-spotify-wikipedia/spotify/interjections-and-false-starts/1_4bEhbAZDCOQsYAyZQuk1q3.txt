Hello Madge hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works hard towards ascension. Okay. So you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I am joined by terrie uh Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream speakers in another well episode of tomes of magic. But before we do, I thought it might be so nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I am doing fine. Well. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the woo Kang now I mean we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about the Wu-Tang um because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it where he like takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours wasn't quite enough but well the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer time and uh North American summer time do not occur at the same time. So I'm so like, let's figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm um like 9:00 p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I can I mean wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and but and then only later did I find out that.
