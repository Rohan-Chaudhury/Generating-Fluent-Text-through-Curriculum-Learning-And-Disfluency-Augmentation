And this is just a quick pause here during our so lesson on English to tell you a little bit about something called anchor anchor is like actually the tool. I am using to produce this podcast for you. So if so you are listening to me right now, it's because of anchor now. What is um anchor anchor is a free free podcast tool that you can use to well create and record and edit. Build your build your podcast right on your phone or your computer anchor uh distributes your podcast for you. So I don't have to track down apple and um Spotify and Google anything it does that all automatically for me. I just kind of so click the button and it goes all by itself. You can you can make money from these so podcasts right this ad that you're hearing right now is an ad that I've written you know for them so that I can make a little bit of money off of uh this podcast.
