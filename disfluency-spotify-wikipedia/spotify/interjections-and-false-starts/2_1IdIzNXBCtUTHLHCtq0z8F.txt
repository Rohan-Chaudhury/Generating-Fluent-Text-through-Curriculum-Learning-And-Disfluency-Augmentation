This is this is this is actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this little Snippets well you know recorded after your episode. Halftime, so halftime, so halftime, so we actually did have our guests on a um uh little bit earlier this week. Yeah, when yeah, when yeah, when he was here because of the way that well like you know, this Gus could make it around but you know, we're recording the um like intro after we record the actual episode. Typically. We like to record the intro you know so this this snippet part without the guest even being around. Yeah. So it just the way you know so it works. So usually we recorded before the guest shows up this last step the like um set this guess we didn't have time to yeah. But anyways, how was how was your week bit how how things been for you?.
