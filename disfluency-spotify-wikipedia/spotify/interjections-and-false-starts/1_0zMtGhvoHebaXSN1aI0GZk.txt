It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small okay range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every I mean living cell. If there if there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood I mean glucose levels are too high. This can this can have a negative impact on osmosis, which uh is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through like the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough so blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases like the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these uh convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble um and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas detects a um normal blood glucose concentration. If the if the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
