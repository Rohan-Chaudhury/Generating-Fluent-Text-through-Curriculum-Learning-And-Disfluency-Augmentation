I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of living um with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived problems well and worries going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. The simple the simple fact that like we all only have one life and that none of us are promised another day uh on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Of our of our current health well status after all would you seriously stay in the job you hate so or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your life could so end next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you happy uh and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this um groundbreaking podcast. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
