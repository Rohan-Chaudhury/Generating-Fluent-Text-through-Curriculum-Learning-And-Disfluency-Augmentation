If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our you know so so uh show notes in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and you know okay uh so and I opened it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone well well like okay ever comes to you saying all is well. They're from they're from they're from they're from they're from Satan and I'm thought thinking uh um like you know you kind of have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own um you know so okay words. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad well I mean I mean uh angels and we want to remind you that that there is a stream so I mean um you know of well-being which you are allowing or not. And what and what and what and what and what we've noticed about any okay I mean well you know who for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment okay um like well with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that I mean so I mean so is so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where well so uh um you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
