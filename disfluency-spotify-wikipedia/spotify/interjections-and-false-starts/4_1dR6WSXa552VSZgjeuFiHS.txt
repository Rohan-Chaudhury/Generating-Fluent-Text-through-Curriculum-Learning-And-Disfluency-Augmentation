Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so excited about talking to okay like so you know you about money. But not but not but not but not but not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology and so so uh so health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you um so you know you know have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal so like like so life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I you know you know okay like get so many questions from people as I travel the world helping. Some uh so you know um VIP. So this is our time for us to be together and for me like I mean so like to answer your questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been so I mean um uh in a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more like I mean like um vocal about it than I am but it's a little frustrating when I see others um you know you know okay getting married and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for I mean uh you know you know them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
