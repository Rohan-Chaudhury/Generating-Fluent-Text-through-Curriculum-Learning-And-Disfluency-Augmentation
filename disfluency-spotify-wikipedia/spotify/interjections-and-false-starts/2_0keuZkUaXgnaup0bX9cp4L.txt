Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become so taboo? I mean um So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a you know I mean fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she um um came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that you know um the World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were I mean like born with may do which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's uh uh basically the idea of ableism and how the world is set up for people you know I mean who are able-bodied as opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very so you know specific way. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really you know well interesting conversation. I really I really I really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
