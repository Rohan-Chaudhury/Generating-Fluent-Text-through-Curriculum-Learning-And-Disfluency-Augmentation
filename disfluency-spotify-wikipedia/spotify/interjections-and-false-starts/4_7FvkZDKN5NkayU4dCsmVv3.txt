You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television so I mean okay like and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work you know well I mean I mean on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an okay uh um like hour a day or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be so well well so directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On well um so you know the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but so I mean uh well not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse you know you know um like behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from you know okay like so time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
