Hi late, Friday morning your head spend all those more working on my Saturday well night talk for tomorrow night, and I'm still doing the history series and also so Snow ending with other work and Purim stuff. I always have a cebit I mean my house. I'm pouring and now I always try to put together something so as I mentioned the other day. I'd only time I ever write anything down like is Is there something going to shop a super work for husbands or also for like Purim believe it or not? Because they always write a five or six well or seven page Arturo whatever couple whatever did I like the liver because so important you drink, you know know, you know, you can't remember what you're saying. So uh I have a text in front of me. So hopefully so hopefully you can't go wrong and well my son from Israel wrote me that sent him a driver toga. For his Yeshiva, and now they're going through the.
