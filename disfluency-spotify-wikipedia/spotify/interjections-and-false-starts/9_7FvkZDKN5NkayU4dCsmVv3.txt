You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and like uh I mean uh I mean well so you know well everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work on uh I mean you know I mean I mean you know you know well um their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a day I mean well I mean so like you know I mean um okay or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors okay uh uh well well like uh well I mean writers producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the you know you know you know like so um okay okay well project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but like okay I mean uh so you know so like okay not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse uh so you know okay um uh um so you know behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color like I mean you know okay like so I mean I mean you know from time to time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
