The Bachelors the Bachelors the Bachelors the Bachelors the Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel I mean um uh like Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading I mean well okay um shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully you know like um uh but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit I mean I mean um like passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake and uh I mean well um eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying how you know uh you know I mean the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the you know I mean like so show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor like uh so I mean show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic I mean you know I mean so environments. The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. Well I well I well I well I well I mean well uh. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season I mean I mean I mean like there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then um I mean like um confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
