Yes. Hi. I am calling this number because I saw it on a bathroom uh like wall. See if see if see if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is going to hell okay um and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have Adam Breeze of Raven okay uh I with us but before we hop into that, I just wanted to go over okay um I sold myself short on the last episode about my romantic capabilities. I think I well well came up on the last. Episode saying episode saying episode saying that I don't remember what I like so got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards out, but I well like personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got him a like I mean heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got him Star Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
