Hello and hello and welcome to be on the borderline. This is the podcast dedicated to exploring in like a realistic and hopeful way what it's like to live with borderline personality disorder um and other mental health problems. My name is Celine and I am your host um for this podcast. I want to issue a Proviso at the beginning of the Podcast well which is that this is absolutely not a substitute for professional mental health and I mean medical intervention. So, please seek out those sources of support if you need them. You know. And I also want to mention that I will be discussing topics such as self-harm and suicidal ideation.
