Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was you know okay so I mean I mean um um very traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front uh uh like uh okay okay well of my eyes. I just I just I just I just I just I just I just I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, I mean so like so uh well like it was so dark in here that I had to use the small lamp on uh uh um like so you know I mean the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Yeah, I also I mean so um you know so like well realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. It didn't do much so okay so you know um uh uh damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first thing I tried was um like well well you know well like to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral vision. They got closer uh so you know I mean okay I mean well as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
