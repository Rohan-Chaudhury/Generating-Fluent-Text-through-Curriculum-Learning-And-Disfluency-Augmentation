Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune out if you know you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported I reported that um Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description well and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was like certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because um Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this so straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette well so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other so reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as but as of right now I like see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts like down in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News like Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on you know her earlier today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check um out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
