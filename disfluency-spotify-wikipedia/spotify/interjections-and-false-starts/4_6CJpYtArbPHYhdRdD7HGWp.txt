I'm your host Mike summer, and um like I mean um I want to help you buy sell and trade your way into a collection I mean uh you know I mean you'll love. Hello everybody and thank you for joining me for another episode today. Okay well I mean so. I want to ask you a question. Do you enjoy collecting cards? No really uh um well so if the whole card industry went away. Do you think your life um um um um would be better or worse? I think if you really stop and think about it and you know well so um honest answer for some of you would be yes, I'd be better off if it all you know uh uh uh went away and for others you. Fathom a life without cards regardless of what your answer was to that question. I want to.
