Hello and welcome to that's akitaka great episode for you today lot of stuff to you know talk about a lot of stuff off the ice, which I want to get well to First. The NHL is apparently unveiling a new Puck filled with Quote unquote electronics like and they're going to be testing out during the playoffs. This is the first time they're um going to throw it in used at least that we know of so read um a little article about this AQ and we were just talking about this before um we went live here. They've apparently used this puck in a couple games during well the regular season without telling the teams or players that they were using it. They've I mean given it to a few of the Superstar players throughout the league the practice with like the see if they can notice anything feedback was generally positive. Of course only one player noticed some issues with it. No Sidney Crosby. He said he could notice.
