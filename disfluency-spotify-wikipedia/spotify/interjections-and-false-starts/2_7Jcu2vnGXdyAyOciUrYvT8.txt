Welcome back welcome back welcome back to emerge today's guest probably needs no introduction. For those of you who well I mean have been following the podcast for some time as speaking with Robert Keegan Robert or I mean you know Bob Keegan. It has a long history of working in the field of adult I mean uh development. And if you're not familiar with Bob's work, you will be after listening to I mean well this show. We do we do we do a kind of Action to his work an overview of so you know the 5 stage model that he created and that has been studied empirically for the you know well last 40 years. And the reason why I wanted to talk to Bob well uh Keegan isn't just because you know, he's kind of a huge inspiration for me but I mean so also because I wanted to have his voice in the mix at the very beginning of this.
