Hello, you lovely bunch and welcome back to yes, another episode of the vitalife well show me Tori and Me Myself and Irene. I have nobody on this podcast and there's well a good reason for it. I also just want to say if the okay sound quality sound slightly different. I do apologize. I haven't got my headphones and well that is because I am currently in the middle of moving so I have packed uh my whole life up not thinking that I needed me. Fines and I'm in like the middle of a hotel because I also started a new job last week. Um. And yeah, it's all decided to come at once. But the reason I actually so chose to do this podcast and do this by myself is because it's something that you know I want to talk to you about just from my own personal experience for okay once to a perfectly honest, obviously with being mental health months and the last couple of episodes to kind of touching on Mental Health.
