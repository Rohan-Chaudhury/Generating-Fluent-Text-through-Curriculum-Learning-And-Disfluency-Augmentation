Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a regular so Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some shit I mean on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of which is um the fact that I have literally not had a job for the past. So. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like a um gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my well bank account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for a um few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
