I hope you guys are having a beautiful week. We are stoked because like so I mean today is part 2 of the October Gonzalez interview and we have been absolutely dying to like uh um release this one. So this so this so this so this episode focuses all on marriage and motherhood and man. There well there well there well there well you know okay are some nuggets up in here. I can't wait for you guys to hear so so okay it. If this is the first one that you're tapping on I do recommend. Going okay um like back and listening to part 1 it's not absolutely imperative. But I do think um uh so that all of the information in part to her story all her tips the way that well you know uh she parents it's all like so much more interesting and almost more like valuable when you um um you know know where she came from part 1 is all about her life as okay well uh a young girl how she was parented her family story Dynamic her as a so um well young woman and it's fascinating and it makes her marriage and motherhood style that much more interesting and I think that's how it is for.
