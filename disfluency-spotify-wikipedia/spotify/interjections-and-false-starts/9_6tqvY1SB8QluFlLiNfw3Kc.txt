Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires um you know okay you know uh so uh um um are so nasty. They are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place um um I mean like uh so you know you know like of the Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due uh so uh uh uh okay well like so to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it the tiebreaker because I mean okay uh okay well you know okay well uh that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care okay you know well okay um well you know you know like if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at the points it uh okay uh well uh uh uh you know so is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the situation well so like you know like uh um um uh we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the Flyers beat like uh like like you know I mean like you know I mean the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
