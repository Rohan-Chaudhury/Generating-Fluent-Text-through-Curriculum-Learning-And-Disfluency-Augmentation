Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will so well um so be your host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink um you know uh well refocus and to renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the you know well so you know memory verse is taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the uh um uh well last and greatest day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice um uh I mean you know let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation like you know uh so to come to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
