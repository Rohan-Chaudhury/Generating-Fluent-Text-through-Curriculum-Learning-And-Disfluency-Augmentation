together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel I mean like how Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day uh you know he gets up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God um okay to be with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be you know so with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes like so to him and he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says like so while I needed to be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. They I mean I mean something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude you know you know of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being with God the like like father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
