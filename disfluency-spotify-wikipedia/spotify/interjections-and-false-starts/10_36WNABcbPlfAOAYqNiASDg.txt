Okay um you know um uh okay uh um uh you know. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you like uh uh well uh so you know okay okay I mean saying all is well. They're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of I mean um you know I mean you know um uh I mean um um have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own words. You know so okay I mean you know well you know you know you know you know. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad uh um you know um so so so you know okay well angels and we want to remind you that that there is a stream of you know I mean well okay um uh like like so like well-being which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who for uh um okay you know you know like um you know okay like whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that so like um uh you know I mean you know you know like so stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is like I mean like so I mean like uh I mean I mean uh so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
