Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So so like well okay so I mean like for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old so well I mean so I mean so I mean school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one okay so you know you know I mean um I mean of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she saw in you know like well okay well um like the theater growing up. I was I was I was I was I was I was I was I was introduced to this movie when I was I mean uh okay I mean so um um about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly inappropriate. Okay um uh like I mean uh uh. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
