Welcome ladies welcome. So I so I so I so I so I so I so I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat texting and so so uh well well you know FaceTime. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I do a lot I mean like like well um well of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some um well you know okay so um of you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few minutes like you know you know well so um and then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk uh I mean uh so um so about first uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age you know so like well uh um of 25 and that and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it okay I mean like you know okay uh for real. It's pushing it. I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
