And then okay I mean so so I mean well if we do find them then on the other side of the world or is too so so like I mean you know well expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 okay uh I mean well so um years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking um um I mean so I mean so a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help more people. Well uh you know well uh I mean.
