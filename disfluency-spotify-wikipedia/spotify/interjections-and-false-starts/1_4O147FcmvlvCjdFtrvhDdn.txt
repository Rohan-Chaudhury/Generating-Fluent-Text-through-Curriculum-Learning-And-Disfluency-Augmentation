Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out if I mean you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported that I mean Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in uh the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that well Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that well that theory is officially dead because you know Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let so let me get this straight. Okay. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so like she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there is there like any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of so right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me let me I mean know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all that's all I've got for today well on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just okay did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check so check that out on this channel I mean and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific like on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
