What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the I mean so um well um um so so gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S uh okay uh okay um um uh so and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from uh like like um like I mean I mean you know a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the I mean well like uh okay I mean you know well third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording like um like okay I mean I mean I mean well and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model so so so I mean so I mean you know okay 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool I mean you know like uh so well like so looking new tire. Hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand you know like um okay so okay so well and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires well like um uh uh you know okay so and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. So um like so well like so like. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's a really cool thing. And I was just I mean so I mean well I mean uh so okay thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury uh uh um um like well okay uh Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort so you know you know I mean uh um okay I mean of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package um well you know uh like so um uh is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
