If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes you know like I mean in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened it. Like uh well. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you uh I mean well saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of I mean um uh have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And I and I and I and I mean like I mean so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels okay uh well and we want to remind you that that there is a stream of uh I mean you know well-being which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any well you know um who for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing like uh like their alignment with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment well I mean you know with the well-being that is so you is so painful from that painful place. I mean you know uh. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
