Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I am too but I'm trying to okay pretend I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this podcast episode um set up because my microphone I feel like it's only really good for one well person and that I feel like our audio is always a little well off and you guys have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it like we're probably going to have to get two separate microphones. But anyway, welcome to okay yeah, we said it with me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first like time tuning in. This is a mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice um questions that you emailed to me and Miss thing at gmail.com. And I would say uh it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
