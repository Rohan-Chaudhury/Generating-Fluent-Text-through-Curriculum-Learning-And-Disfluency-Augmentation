It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels like you know you know you know so you know like I mean well like within a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by well I mean uh um like um I mean um um um every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough well I mean so uh uh uh like um so I mean energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative so I mean uh uh uh okay you know you know well well impact on osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients well I mean I mean like uh so uh I mean so I mean as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. You know you know you know you know you know um like you know uh um. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas well I mean like like okay uh well uh uh uh releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence uh well uh so well well um um I mean like of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of I mean um uh you know I mean like uh you know okay you know glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the you know uh you know uh like well uh you know so okay pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
