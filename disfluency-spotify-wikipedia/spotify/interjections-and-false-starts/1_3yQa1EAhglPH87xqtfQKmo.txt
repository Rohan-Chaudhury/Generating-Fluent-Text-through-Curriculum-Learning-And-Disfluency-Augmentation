Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic I mean of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This well is something that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is um you're not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel so like things are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel like I mean you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're going I mean to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's going to feel so hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially okay if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling you okay what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you want so to build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for you know you. So I've got an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
