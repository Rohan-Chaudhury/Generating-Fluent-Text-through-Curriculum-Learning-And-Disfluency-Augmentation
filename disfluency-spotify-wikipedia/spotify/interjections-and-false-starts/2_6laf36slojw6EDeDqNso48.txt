I've never I've never I've never even been to Oklahoma. I'm pretty sure it's where the wind goes whipping down so like the plains and up until recently that's about what I knew of it. But um but um but um so now I know it's also the ancestral home of two warring American factions those no-good like okay greasers and those rotten sotius. Greetings and greetings and greetings and welcome to fuckboys of literature. I'm your host um like Emily Edwards. What is it about this book? That just that just that just gets it I I mean um mention it on Twitter and it gets love letters. So with me today is um so writer journalist Leslie gray Streeter. How are you today?
