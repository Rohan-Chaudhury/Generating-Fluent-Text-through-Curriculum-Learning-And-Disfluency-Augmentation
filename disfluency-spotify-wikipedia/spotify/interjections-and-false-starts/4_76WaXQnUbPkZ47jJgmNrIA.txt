Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the Gospel reading uh like so so from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an exegesis of I mean like well well the literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter okay well well um 5 verse 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how it was so so okay um said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say this to well I mean you know well you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in this way. So okay um well. You will be sons of your father in Heaven for he causes his sun to like like uh uh rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
