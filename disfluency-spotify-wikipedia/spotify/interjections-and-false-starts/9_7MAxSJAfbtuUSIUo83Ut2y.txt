As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot like well um you know um you know you know so well and a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so okay well uh well um like okay uh um it was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was I mean uh um uh uh you know you know well well through the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which like uh um like like okay you know like uh was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not so you know well you know like like okay so well our number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody could uh okay well uh like okay okay well well win and there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess you could say well so well like okay you know so uh like I'm not too sure what is safe for the radio. So I'm going well like like uh I mean I mean um so like to kind of curve that but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay I mean okay you know uh I mean uh uh um nobody was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a you know well I mean so like well uh so so thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
