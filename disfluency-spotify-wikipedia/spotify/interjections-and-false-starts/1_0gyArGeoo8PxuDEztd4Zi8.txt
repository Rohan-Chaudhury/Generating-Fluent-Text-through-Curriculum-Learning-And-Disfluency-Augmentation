Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on vale. Well. I was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder so song as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And all like it did for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me of you know all time, which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, I mean, first of all you know when you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got to you know go. Um, man, um, man, I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's my okay favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on you know it. Is that Love's in Need of Love today? We need to give the like love back to ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted okay to get you to consider that you can apply this to lots of things in um your life and fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
