This is this is a podcast about tree planting like as a reforestation practice in the Civic culture industry tree plungers are a uh collective of people who spend much of their lives replenishing the logged area with New like Forest. However tree planting is so much more than the physical act of planting like thousands of seedlings in the ground day after day as a Job, it so is about the connections experiences bonds and memories that last a lifetime. The dirt like is a place to shed light on the culture that is mostly contained within um those who have stuck with shovel in the ground.
