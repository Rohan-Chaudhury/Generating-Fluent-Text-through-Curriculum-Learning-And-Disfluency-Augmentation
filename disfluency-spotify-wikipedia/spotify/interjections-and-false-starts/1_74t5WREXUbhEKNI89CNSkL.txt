Welcome back welcome back to another episode of tuxedo time where we were Tuxedos and it's time. I mean. I love cast Edition. Yes, I love that when you say it. You sound you know like you're trying to be a radio announcer. You're like welcome back to another episode okay of I don't want to put my microphone. We're not in the new studio yet I mean because we had a little bit of a hangout if you watch the Vlog that okay we posted at by the time you listen to this a few weeks ago I mean we found Mice in our basement. So we had to put our project on hold like for a few while we get rid of that. But in but in the meantime okay now, we're sitting in our living room. So we've now recorded a podcast uh in three different places. This is definitely the most comfortable out of all um of them so high so, what's the plan today? Listen? I haven't seen you so in like a week and a half sure. We have one together. Yeah. Okay. So let me rephrase that. I haven't really.
