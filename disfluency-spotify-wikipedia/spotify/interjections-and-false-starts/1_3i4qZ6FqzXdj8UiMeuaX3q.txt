Hello and welcome back in to another episode of the hard foul. I'm your well host Pearson Fowler and with me as always from Gamecock central.com Kyle and Taylor here so to talk about South Carolina's incredibly important quite impressive 12-point home victory over the Mississippi I mean State Bulldogs, 83-71. Again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and they uh did and it wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they got um up big early and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that lead going you know into halftime and then by the second half things kind of evened out in South Carolina, uh they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 and most of the um time they were up by like six or something like that but it felt comfortable in okay South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but a lot of so good performances from a lot of different areas and as much as we've well talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
