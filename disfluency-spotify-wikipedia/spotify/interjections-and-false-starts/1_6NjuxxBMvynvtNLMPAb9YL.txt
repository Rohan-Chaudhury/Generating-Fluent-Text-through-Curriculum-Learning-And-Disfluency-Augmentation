Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a okay release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget um the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. Uh. I just I just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Uh. Like when like when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when you know I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times uh as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all I mean the work out. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or uh lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't um know what that's going to be or when it will be but it just I mean happens after you listen to it for a while and then when you actually okay then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come well together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments you know that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
