It is it is it is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within I mean um a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by so I mean every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough so uh energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a so okay negative impact on osmosis, which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration you know so gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is so okay a high concentration. Enough blood enough blood enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the um okay pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence so um of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that like like is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the um okay pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the if the if the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
