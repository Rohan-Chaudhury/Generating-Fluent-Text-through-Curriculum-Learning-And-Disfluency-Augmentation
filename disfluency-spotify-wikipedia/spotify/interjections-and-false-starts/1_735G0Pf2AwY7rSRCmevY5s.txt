Is arranged marriage a um scary proposition last year three of my friends had terrible experiences involving arranged marriage in uh the first experience. The two parties are engaged and right before the wedding the girl told like him that she loves somebody else in the second experience as a wedding date approached the girl ran uh away with her boyfriend in the third experience the two parties got married, but within well a month my friend found out that she was still in touch with her ex-boyfriend uh and probably had an affair and asked he filed for divorce right away. Such so experience has made me wonder what are the reasons that make people go for an arranged matters on man.
