The Tuesday the Tuesday first race of the day of the meeting is a supreme well novices hurdle grade one. We've got shishkin at five to two Astro and phalange you know 72 Abracadabra 601 change warehouses noise and then we've got my pick you know a last 25 to 1 Nick ends and seconds during the race with Jeremiah McGraw so confirmed to be riding him on the day. Two main two main Market while I was issued okay in a stirring for lunch. They probably deserve to be up there because they've like got probably the best form of all the horses in the race. She skin very like impressive as two wins. And again asking for loans and being free starts this year looking um very very impressive indeed two wins over hurdles and one in a bump of him. You know. I've gone without a heart he is a two-time winner over hurdle so far like this season, he filed his first start over the obstacles at Ascot last year very well back.
