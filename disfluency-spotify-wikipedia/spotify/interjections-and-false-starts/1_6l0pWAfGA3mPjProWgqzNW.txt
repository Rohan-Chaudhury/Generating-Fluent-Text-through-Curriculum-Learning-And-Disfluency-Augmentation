Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may well ask that is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven years old Nate I mean nasty couple of nicknames. He had he had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Ace Qbert uh Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I uh assure you I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. Um. The years but the reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is um because he has a propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four you know weeks at a time or maybe even a couple days when I get my so sad boy moments. I'm talking six months to a year. This man can disappear at I mean times. He has a lot of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
