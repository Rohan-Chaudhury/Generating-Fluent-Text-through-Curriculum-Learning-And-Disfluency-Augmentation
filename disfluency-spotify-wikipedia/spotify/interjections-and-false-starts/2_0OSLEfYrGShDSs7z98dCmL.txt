Hello, so turns out that people do actually want to listen to what I have like you know to say, which is pretty shocking because my own boyfriend doesn't listen to what okay you know I ever say, so there's a surprise but I'm glad that everyone is on board I mean I mean and I'm excited for this little journey this little educational Journey that we okay um are going to go on together. I've done a little eye. Like organizing and like um you know note books and stationery and stuff and lists. So I've so I've so I've done list of how like you know I want it to pan out whether or not it pans out like that is well so another story because I can be a little bit impulsive. So we shall see so well but I want you to shut your eyes everyone that's listening. Please unless you're uh so driving. If you're driving, please do not show your eyes, but shut your eyes and remember the last time that you ate.
