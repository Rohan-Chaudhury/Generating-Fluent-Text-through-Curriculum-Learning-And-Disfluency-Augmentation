Hello plants tongue of fuck. Okay, I'm upset. Well, I am too but I'm trying to pretend well like I'm not okay. We've had a lot of trouble getting this podcast episode set up well I mean because my microphone I feel like it's only really good for one person and so you know that I feel like our audio is always a little off and you um I mean guys have probably noticed that and I'm trying to troubleshoot it we're probably going to I mean I mean have to get two separate microphones. But anyway, but anyway, but anyway, welcome to yeah, we said it with you know so me. Me Emma and Ellen This is your first time tuning in. This is a so uh mother-daughter podcast where we answer your life advice questions that you emailed to me uh I mean and Miss thing at gmail.com. And I would say it's a little advice a lot of talking and a lot of attitude. We're not licensed therapists.
