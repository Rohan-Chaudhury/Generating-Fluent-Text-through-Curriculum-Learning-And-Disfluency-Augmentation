Sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things um okay like okay I mean like you know well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me okay like um um uh uh okay that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six okay uh I mean well you know well you know of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed you're supposed to sit uh like I mean okay so I mean uh on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it uh so I mean you know you know well so and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's so um so so I mean so well it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to like uh uh I mean so okay I mean but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, so um well like like um so but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to I mean uh I mean you know okay uh uh stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
