July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 year old okay so uh you know came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend Juanita Lopez you know uh like so over dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over San Jose um like I mean uh the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as it seemed uh so um okay after dinner. He went he went he went he went he went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin just like most uh I mean I mean I mean nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The drugs burned hot okay well well I mean through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began to hallucinate um um you know uh and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next the next the next the next the next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
