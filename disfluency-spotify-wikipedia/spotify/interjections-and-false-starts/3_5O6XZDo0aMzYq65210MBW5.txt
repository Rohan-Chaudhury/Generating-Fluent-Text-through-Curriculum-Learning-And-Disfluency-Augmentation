I wanted to so uh well take a brief moment today to let you know about the easiest way possible to okay so you know start your very own podcast. Some of some of some of some of the more important aspects are actually like well well having a service to host and distribute the show as well as software to record each I mean uh okay episode for the longest time. I actually paid money to host the packet okay like like a podcast and have a distributed to different podcasting platforms while also using uh so so different software as I tried to record but not anymore anchor gives me everything we you know so um need to record host and Ribbit our podcast for free either from my computer tablet or okay so I mean cell phone.
