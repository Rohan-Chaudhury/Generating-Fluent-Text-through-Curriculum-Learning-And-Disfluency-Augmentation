Well, I think this is like episode 56 or something. Maybe well uh it maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers out there to correct us, you okay uh know, occasionally we do say things that are not correct often speak um like for yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the show, so uh but that just has because we do is almost zero prep. We just kind you know okay of come from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think most you know well of the time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from someplace I mean so else. Never glad. I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad that I don't think it's ever happened to Glenn. I'm uh I'm uh I'm uh I mean glad you got me last week on Warfield and Whitfield.
