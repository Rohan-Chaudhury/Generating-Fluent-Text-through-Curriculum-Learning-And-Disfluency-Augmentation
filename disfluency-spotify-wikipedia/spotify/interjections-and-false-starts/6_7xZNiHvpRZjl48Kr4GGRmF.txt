Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I I mean I mean okay you know I mean well have just some random stuff. I want I want I want I want I want I want I want us to talk about before we talk about like uh so so like so I mean life. So last episode we both talked about how we were reading the Jessica Simpson like I mean like well so well book open book Shay. My question is no spoilers. We don't have to say anything well so you know so well like in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it Shea tell me if like okay I mean uh okay so you would rather be Nick Lachey or John Mayer after reading Jessica's back home - if I so uh okay uh uh you know were John Mayer, I would be under a rock right now. I even went uh like so so I mean uh to his Instagram account. I don't follow him just to see if people were commenting. Like uh well I mean um um. That's like the rabbit hole. I went down when I read this but that like uh uh you know well uh bad it's not that bad. I went to his Instagram because I don't know in like okay okay I mean I mean um my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
