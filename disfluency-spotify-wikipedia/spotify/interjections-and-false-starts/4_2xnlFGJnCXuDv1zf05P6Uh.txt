What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about like so well okay the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S I mean so okay uh and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about um you know well okay from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to so like uh like the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We so we so we so we so we so well like you know were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for okay so like um the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking well okay so okay new tire. Hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you like well so you know pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads like uh um uh which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. I mean uh um you know. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so I mean uh uh um much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all so um so like of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans like uh like um and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, well you know okay so but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
