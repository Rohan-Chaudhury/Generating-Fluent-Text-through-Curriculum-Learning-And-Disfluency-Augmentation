You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and everything like uh uh in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work on their projects. You know I mean I mean. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a day or you know okay um weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers producers or cinematographers. It so it so it so it so like you know varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On the project we talked about well like well a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but not necessarily and that is I mean you know um what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse behind the curtain so like well of film and television the podcast will talk about color from time to time, uh I mean um but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
