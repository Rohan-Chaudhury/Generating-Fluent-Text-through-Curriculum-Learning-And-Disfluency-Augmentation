Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl I mean like you know Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is so is so is so is he do well well well you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? uh well you know Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had okay okay you know girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when I mean you know you know doing gcses and a-levels. So I so I so I so I have some days where I meant to be so so um in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need uh so you know to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is okay so um chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
