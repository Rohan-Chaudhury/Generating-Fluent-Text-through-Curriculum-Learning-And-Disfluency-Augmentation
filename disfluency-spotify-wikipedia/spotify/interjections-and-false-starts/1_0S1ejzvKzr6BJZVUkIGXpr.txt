A few months back. We did a call-in show. Hello. This is Josh. This is uh Tiffany Walling McGarity. I'm one of the three founders from medical and you our listeners voted well Tiffany Walling McGarity on Pitch Island going from a phone call to well the pitch room isn't an easy trick to pull off today. We'll hear a well pitch the likes of which we've never had on the show before. What does so it pitch sound like before any revenues even before the product is built in well all the founder has is an idea and a gut feeling that that idea so could turn into a big business today on the show. What a pitch uh sounds like when all you have are a few scratches on the back I mean of the metaphorical napkin from gimlet. This is the pitch. I'm Josh puccio. Um. Let's meet the investors and Maya Bittner Maya built to financial tech companies and sold them Bowl. Now. She's out scouting startups for Sequoia. One.
