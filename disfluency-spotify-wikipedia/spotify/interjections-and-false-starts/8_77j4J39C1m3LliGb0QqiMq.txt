The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay um I mean so um so okay uh you know emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading so well so okay um um well um shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully okay I mean um I mean uh okay like um but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit well so I mean well you know uh uh so passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake and eat uh uh I mean you know okay like like so it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying how like you know so well well um uh well the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the show taking no well I mean okay uh okay I mean like I mean accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show Runners are uh you know I mean I mean uh so so I mean producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The show is like um so uh so well uh well specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You can't uh you know I mean uh like you know like like guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season there will be like uh uh so uh you know like okay multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then confronting her okay um okay um like uh like um about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
