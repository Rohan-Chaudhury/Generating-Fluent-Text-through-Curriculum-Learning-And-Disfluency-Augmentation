Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. We um I mean are joined. Once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very special episode. So so. I like these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological career of okay uh the competitor or the coach that we interview in this case. We interviewed. And since you know I mean it was the second time we had him on we'd already covered his so okay career. And so I got to talk about a lot of things on this uh uh show and I had I'd get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on okay you know a lot of different things and we kind of went through a couple topics like okay one was his little brother Greg just want his fifth State title High School in I mean I mean New York. And so and so and so we talked a little bit about that and then Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
