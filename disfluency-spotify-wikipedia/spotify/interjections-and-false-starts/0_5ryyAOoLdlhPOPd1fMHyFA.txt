Again playing the game yet. I and welcome to the trailer or bit of an introduction episode for the NRL super coach chat pod cast Jose here. Thought I'd give you a bit of a rundown of what this podcast is going to be about. Each week and give you a chance to subscribe and get yourself set up for the upcoming NRL super coach season. So I've played Super kosher about seven years and I've spent a lot of time watching thinking reading listening to everything about the game The Players the trades the injuries and so I thought why don't I give you my thoughts and try and give you some tips and tactics to players who might be just starting out or could use a bit of guidance each week and don't have the time to.
