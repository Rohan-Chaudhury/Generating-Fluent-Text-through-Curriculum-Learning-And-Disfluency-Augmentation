Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things like okay so about the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom uh so you know of a mentor to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, um like so too often finding that person. We trust we trust we trust we trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if I mean um well we do find them then on the other side of the world or is um well well too expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been I've been I've been I've been mentoring people now for over uh okay um 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. Okay uh so. I've been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I uh okay um can help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group well I mean like here. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can I mean well I mean ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction well like you know of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
