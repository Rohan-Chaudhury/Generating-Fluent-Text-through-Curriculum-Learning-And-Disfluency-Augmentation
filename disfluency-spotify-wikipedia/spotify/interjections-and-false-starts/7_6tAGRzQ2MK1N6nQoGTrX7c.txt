Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through I mean okay well so um well like a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down you know you know like okay so so so on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can also well I mean so well okay um I mean do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure that you know like so uh like so okay your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you have your legs okay uh I mean well um uh well crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet Flat on you know I mean you know so um um okay the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either uh okay you know I mean well like like you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. Um uh I mean well so well uh. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
