Hello guys. This is dr. William Cairo Bowl starting the first broadcast that you know I'm going to be doing regularly once a week to cover the basic science of okay the coronavirus and to review and sort of restore some of the sanity to okay the conversation about this this illness in sort of the electronic discourse that goes uh About it to try to just seal fact from fiction. There's a lot of um Buzz right now in the media. I believe that there's been a very severe, I mean you know response already like last week in the stock market and Wall Street, and I decided to do this podcast because I realized that.
