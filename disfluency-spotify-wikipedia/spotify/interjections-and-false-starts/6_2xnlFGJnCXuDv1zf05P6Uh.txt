What a what a what a what a what a what a what a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going we're going we're going we're going we're going we're going we're going to talk about the um well I mean I mean okay you know gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid model you know you know uh I mean you know okay X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a okay well I mean like well uh financial perspective. So going so going so going so going so going so going so going to nerd out on this shout out to the third I mean I mean you know well I mean okay row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and well like I mean I mean you know okay we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's um okay I mean I mean well I mean like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours well um I mean so well well for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five I mean well so like I mean I mean and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads uh um okay so so um which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some you know like well I mean okay like awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, uh uh uh okay you know like there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell uh okay uh uh so um all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like so well so um you know like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what uh so I mean I mean you know well I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
