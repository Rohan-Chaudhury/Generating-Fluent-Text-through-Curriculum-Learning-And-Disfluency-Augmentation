I guess uh uh um well like so you know there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that okay okay well you know so like you know I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little well you know you know you know I mean uh um bit the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise me. You know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know I mean I mean uh uh well okay. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt here I mean okay well uh like so like towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 like well um so so um like following it says this and the evening of that first day of the week when um you know well well okay you know well the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the jews. So I mean so okay so um well. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you after he like like so okay well well well said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
