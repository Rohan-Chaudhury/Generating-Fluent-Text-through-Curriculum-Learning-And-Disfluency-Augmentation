Hope you well um well well well you know guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode um okay um you know I mean okay starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this podcast okay so um uh like uh is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I mean well um so I mean okay thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you so like like uh well so know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded I mean okay like I mean you know I mean the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme um uh uh uh you know like of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the things that okay um okay um well I mean we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and things you know you know like okay uh I mean we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So with that said the like uh so you know well like new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I finally figure out what you know I mean like so um okay the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up is going to be uh you know well uh uh you know having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them share what they think I mean like I mean uh I mean so is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
