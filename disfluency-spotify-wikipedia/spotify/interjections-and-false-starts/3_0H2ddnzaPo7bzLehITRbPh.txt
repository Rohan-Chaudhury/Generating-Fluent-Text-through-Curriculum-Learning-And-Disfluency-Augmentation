I'm from I'm from I'm from I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey you know well so of living with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived I mean so um problems and worries going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. Well you know um. The simple fact that we all only have one life and that none of us so so uh are promised another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Of I of I of I of I mean you know I mean our current health status after all would you seriously stay in the job you hate so well like or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you truly felt your life could end uh okay okay next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you happy well so so and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this groundbreaking podcast. Uh um well. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
