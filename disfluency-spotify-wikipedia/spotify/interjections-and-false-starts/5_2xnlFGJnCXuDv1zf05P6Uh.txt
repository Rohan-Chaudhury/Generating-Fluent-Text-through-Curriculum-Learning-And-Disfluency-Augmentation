What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about you know um I mean well you know the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S uh okay okay well um and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about well uh you know like like from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the um well well like you know third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording um so um so so and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. So like well um you know. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new uh um so okay I mean tire. Hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you um you know uh well um pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these like so you know I mean like brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten it's gotten it's gotten it's gotten it's gotten it's gotten so um um so you know some awesome reviews. So that's so that's so that's so that's so that's so that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking uh so okay like uh like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand so well okay I mean uh to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard well you know uh okay I mean fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, I mean uh uh so like but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
