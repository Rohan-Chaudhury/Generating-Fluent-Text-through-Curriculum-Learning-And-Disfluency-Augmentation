Hello, so turns out that people do actually want to listen to what I have you know to say, which is pretty shocking because my own boyfriend doesn't listen to what I uh ever say, so there's a surprise but I'm glad that everyone is on board and I mean I'm excited for this little journey this little educational Journey that we are going to go okay on together. I've done a little eye. Like organizing and like note books and like stationery and stuff and lists. So I've done list of how I want uh it to pan out whether or not it pans out like that is another story okay because I can be a little bit impulsive. So we shall see but I want you know you to shut your eyes everyone that's listening. Please unless you're driving. If you're um driving, please do not show your eyes, but shut your eyes and remember the last time that you ate.
