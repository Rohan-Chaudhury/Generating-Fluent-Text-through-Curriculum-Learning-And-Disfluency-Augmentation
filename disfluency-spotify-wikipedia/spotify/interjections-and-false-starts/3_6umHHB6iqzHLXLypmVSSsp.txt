Ain't there uh okay uh was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that came from so like you know growing up between worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and okay uh like the hard then I went to a school for missionaries kids in Germany so I mean um when I was in ninth grade, and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences. Like so you know. I hadn't quite been able to put a finger on we're not just in me my so so so friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
