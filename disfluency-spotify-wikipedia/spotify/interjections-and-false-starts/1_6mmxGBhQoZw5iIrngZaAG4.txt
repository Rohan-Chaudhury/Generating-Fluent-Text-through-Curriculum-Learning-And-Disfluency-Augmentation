Hello and welcome back into the hard foul. I'm your host Pearson Fowler with me as uh always from Gamecock central.com the bad luck charm in South Carolina Gamecocks this entire uh weekend Colin Taylor Colin. I hate that you have to wear that albatross around your um neck, but you had a busy weekend. He did he did a lot of travel. It's much um appreciated Gamecock fans everywhere appreciate your vigilance your dedication to traveling and I sound like so I'm being sarcastic because it's not a clock. In the morning, but I'm well being serious because Friday you were in Colombia. You covered the baseball game so and then Saturday morning you woke up and drove to Tuscaloosa. Watch the basketball you know game. And then you said you stayed overnight in Hoover or Birmingham somewhere thereabouts and uh then drove to Clemson, South Carolina first thing Sunday morning to cover the baseball game then I mean came back to Colombia. And the now you are back here in downtown Columbia at nine o'clock on Monday morning again admirable seriously everybody appreciates.
