We're going to start this section in verses 1 through 4 today 2nd so you know Corinthians chapter 5 beginning in verse 1 for we know that if the tent uh like that is our Earthly home is destroyed. We have a building from God a house okay okay not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this tent we groan I mean you know longing to put on our Heavenly dwelling if indeed by putting it on we may like um not be found naked for while we are still in this tent we groan so you know being burdened not that we would be unclothed but that we would be further.
