I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to well well so so um you saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind like so well well okay of have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own like um you know well um words. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels uh you know um so um and bad angels and we want to remind you that that there is a stream um uh I mean okay like of well-being which you are allowing or not. And what and what and what and what and what and what we've noticed about any who so uh so okay you know for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not so like I mean well um allowing their alignment with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational um um like I mean okay alignment with the well-being that is so you is so painful from that um um uh so well painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
