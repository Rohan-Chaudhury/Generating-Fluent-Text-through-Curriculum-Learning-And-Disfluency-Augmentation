So right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred so uh well you know okay twenty seven cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in uh okay you know uh um the United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not we're not we're not we're not we're not we're not at one. 102 cases like I mean uh uh I mean confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we haven't had I mean you know like well um any deaths in California. And so there might be something specific look going on uh well um well uh in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
