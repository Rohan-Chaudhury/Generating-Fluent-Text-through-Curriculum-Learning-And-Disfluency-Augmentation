Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a release for um you know uh me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget I forget I forget I forget the uh okay like choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened I mean okay you know to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in like uh I mean the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I um you know I mean just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm uh um like not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just it's just it's just it's just filled music and uh okay okay what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks uh I mean I mean will come up and you don't know what that's going to be or when it okay um um will be but it just happens after you listen to it for a while and um you know um then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography like well well when those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in the I mean I mean you know music. So those little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle okay so I mean that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
