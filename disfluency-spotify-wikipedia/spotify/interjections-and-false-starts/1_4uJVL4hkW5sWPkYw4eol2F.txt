Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your I'm your host Ed Makai time well major Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross rental yields uh in Parnell. Now, you now, you might be wondering why are we talking about Parnell given well that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably not likely um an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a couple of uh weeks ago. I got I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks okay in New Zealand and they said can you comment on an article that we're writing okay for our website where they were showing by the latest core logic data that I mean the the median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is I mean 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% so. And they and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
