Make sure to check out part one of this series. Thank you. I was very okay um like traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front like well um of my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. And like so like again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the small well okay so lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights well well so here. Yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. Like so like. It didn't it didn't it didn't it didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first the first the first the first like um uh thing I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral um uh you know vision. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
