This is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's begin you know like like I mean in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen was like you know I mean like called a mind all those we promise to pray for. I think the like uh okay you know most exhilarating truth is that before the world was created God already had you uh like well uh and I in mind each with our own particular place in the grand plan of I mean I mean so you know history that no other person can or ever will take we were designed for so so uh uh this role and only we can fulfill it and if we don't no one will I mean so well you know Father favor and his spiritual conferences rights. No two of us are alike. God uh um I mean well saw a specialty in US eternally, it was this specialty which he loved it is this specialty which decides our place and our work and his creation.
