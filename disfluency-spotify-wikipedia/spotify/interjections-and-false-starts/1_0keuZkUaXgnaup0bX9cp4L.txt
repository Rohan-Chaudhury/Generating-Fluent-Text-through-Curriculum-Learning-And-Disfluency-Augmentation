Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become okay so taboo? So I so I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a you know fitness influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she well came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that the I mean World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do so which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but act but it's basically the idea of ableism uh and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as I mean opposed to those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. Well. It was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting conversation. I uh I uh really hope you enjoy it as always. Please do rate review And subscribe. Bye. Hi guys, and welcome to adulting today. I am joined by Sophie Butler.
