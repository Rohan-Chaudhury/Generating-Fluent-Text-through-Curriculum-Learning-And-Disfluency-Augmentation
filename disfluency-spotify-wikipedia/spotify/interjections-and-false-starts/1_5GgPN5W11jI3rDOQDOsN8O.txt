Hello, beautiful hello, beautiful people and welcome to waking youth. My name is got a lotta gibberish. I mean. I'll be your host and I have to say I'm extremely happy to be here um with you today. And in this episode, I'll just be introducing waking youth. How did I I mean come up with this idea? And what waking youth is all about so over uh the summer I was listening to a lot of podcasts and I was you know thinking that I really wanted to work and focus on my creativity and when you know I started the semester I am Third-year communication student in Spain. I was also um looking for an initiative and I was feeling very stressed and very anxious and I realized okay that a lot of my friends were also feeling like this because we're obviously we're I mean very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and.
