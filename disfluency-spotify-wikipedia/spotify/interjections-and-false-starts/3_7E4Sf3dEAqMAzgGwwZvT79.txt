Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the so okay like topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I got you know so um an email here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for is um okay um probably since late last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been okay like so coaching him now. Well maybe longer so he sent me this email and he's got like um um a couple of situations that he's asking me about so he basically he meets you know like you know his All at a concert and I guess his group and her group of friends well you know I mean kind of emerged at some point, and she listened this. She says she says she says she says that she well I mean um told him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
