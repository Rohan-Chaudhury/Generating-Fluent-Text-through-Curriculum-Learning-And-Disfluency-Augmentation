Welcome ladies welcome. So I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat texting okay uh and FaceTime. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I do a so uh lot of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some of um um you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few um um minutes and then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I but I but I want to talk so okay about first uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age like well of 25 and that and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it for real. Well okay. It's pushing it. I'm not I'm not I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
