What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about you know you know um the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and like okay so plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited um okay so about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the you know like like third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just like um I mean recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model you know I mean you know 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Okay uh um. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then okay well so you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake okay you know like pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten well okay um some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like like um like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to so you know like upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard you know um I mean fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but uh I mean I mean what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
