Welcome ladies welcome. So I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat you know so so texting and FaceTime. We all we all we all we all probably have those devices on our phones. I do a you know so like lot of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some um so I mean of you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few minutes you know so like and then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk about I mean uh you know first uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so okay, so okay, so okay, so I feel like if you're over the age of 25 like like I mean and that and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it for real. It's uh uh um pushing it. I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
