I actually I actually didn't have the mic in my hand. So. I got a uh well I mean fat callus on my hand right now. Sorry, I like sandpaper. It's all um you know like right. But yeah, so sorry about that long break we took we were just really like um um busy with midterms papers. We went on a Hiatus we just were busy. Yeah. Sorry, you sorry, you sorry, you sorry, you know well like not a Hiatus. That means that means that means that means we're like temporarily broken up. It's a short break. Okay spotty spotty neck.
