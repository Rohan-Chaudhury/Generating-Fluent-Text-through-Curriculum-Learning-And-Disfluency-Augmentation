Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week late. Um. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to okay New Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was it was just a you know lot of stuff going on and I could have recorded like the days okay after but I had so much shit like a dentist's appointment. I had to well go get my pap. Smear I have errands to run I was linking with people that well I see in a while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm so staying in New Orleans and my mom house and then my brother's over here like and nephews and it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in okay my house and no one's here right now, which is kind of rare. So you so you know I'm trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
