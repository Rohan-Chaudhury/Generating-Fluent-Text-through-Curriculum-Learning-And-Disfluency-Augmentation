Hello, I'm hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly weekly podcast and okay I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as so far and you know want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made a mistake okay on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she put okay out and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it that I well said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but You know you know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
