He'll and he'll and he'll and he'll and he'll and he'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and well like okay um like other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to reinvent you know um you know um I mean religion for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a I mean well so uh like friend while listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which you know uh well well uh I highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the I mean like uh well uh speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So um well um uh okay instead of Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable uh so uh uh so when it's only coming out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because well um uh so like I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
