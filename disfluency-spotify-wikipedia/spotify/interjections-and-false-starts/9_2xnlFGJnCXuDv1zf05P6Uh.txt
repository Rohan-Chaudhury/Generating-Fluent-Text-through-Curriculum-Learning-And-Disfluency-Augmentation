What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the so you know I mean well I mean like like like uh gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and you know like uh so um so okay okay so plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a well like I mean I mean I mean I mean um so I mean financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third uh well okay uh um okay um uh so row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were we were we were we were we were we were we were we were we were we were just recording and well I mean okay I mean so uh I mean you know um we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's so like I mean I mean like um you know uh I mean like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking well you know you know I mean like well like like uh new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you know well I mean like I mean so so like okay you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads you know so so okay okay like I mean okay so which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome um okay so you know so you know well well uh reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, well well okay okay well so like well you know there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand uh okay okay I mean you know so okay so uh to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of uh well you know like okay I mean okay you know I mean Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one I mean so I mean uh uh like you know so okay example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
