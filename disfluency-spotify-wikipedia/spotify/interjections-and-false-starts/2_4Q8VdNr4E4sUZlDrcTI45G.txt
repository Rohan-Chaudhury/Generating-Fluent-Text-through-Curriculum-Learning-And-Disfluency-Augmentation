Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. I guess you know uh there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that I had uh well a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a little okay okay bit the day up. But for but for but for the most part very few things surprise you know you know me. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt I mean well here towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 well um following it says this and the evening of that first day of the week so you know when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus okay okay came and stood among them and said peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
