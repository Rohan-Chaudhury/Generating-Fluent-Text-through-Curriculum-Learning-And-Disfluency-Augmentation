The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when like Rachel Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which uh included her reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was I mean handled Tastefully but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its um inclusion on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the okay show to have its cake and eat it too with one trending post led by uh user and ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment so for bullying and the show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at well The Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic um environments. The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. Like. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season there well will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and well then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
