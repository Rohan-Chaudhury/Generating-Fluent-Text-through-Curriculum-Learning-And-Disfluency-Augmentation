Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires well okay are so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of uh uh the Metropolitan. Well, technically well, technically well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due uh I mean to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because you know okay that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care uh I mean if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at uh uh the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is so okay the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat you know um the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a back-to-back um like back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
