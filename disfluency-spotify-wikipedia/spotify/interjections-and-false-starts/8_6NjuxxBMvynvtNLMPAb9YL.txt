I you know well like like you know well uh okay forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I like so well like you know um okay okay just listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Well I mean so you know I mean I mean okay like. Like when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the like uh you know okay well like like like laundry when I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many like like so okay you know like so like times as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all I mean I mean well okay well okay okay I mean the work out. It's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up so like so like um I mean uh you know or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't uh uh um uh okay so I mean you know know what that's going to be or when it will be but it just uh um uh well like you know okay okay happens after you listen to it for a while and then when you actually then like well okay so okay I mean okay okay go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come you know well so okay well you know you know you know together and you teach your already naturally in the music.
