Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or I mean uh so um well okay so try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that like uh so uh I mean well well going on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this okay so like I mean okay well you know podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal um well you know you know well uh I mean stories that being real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, uh so like um like well like it's quite the opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability okay like uh like well well uh to continue to grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve okay uh so like uh I mean you know as a reminder that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when uh um um uh like like uh our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
