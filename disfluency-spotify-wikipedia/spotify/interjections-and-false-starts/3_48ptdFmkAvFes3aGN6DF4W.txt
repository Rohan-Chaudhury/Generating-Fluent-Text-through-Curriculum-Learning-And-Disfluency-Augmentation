Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name is Michael and I will be your um so like host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus and to you know uh I mean renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And the memory verse is um like well taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on the last and greatest day okay like um of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who is okay like you know thirsty come to me and drink when we view the invitation to come to Jesus um so like Through the lens of the Greek text. It is it is it is it is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
