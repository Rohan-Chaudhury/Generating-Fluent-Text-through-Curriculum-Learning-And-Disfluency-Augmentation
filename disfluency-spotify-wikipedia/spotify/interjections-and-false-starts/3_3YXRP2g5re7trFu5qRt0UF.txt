It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you know, um well um you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. Like um well. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here uh I mean well to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So um so you know it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, um so well you know was a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it so so okay was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful like like I mean ways to make you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally so well like useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah uh so like blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
