The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that um uh so I mean uh I mean well uh were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how I mean I mean okay I mean um um well so we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And okay and okay and okay and okay and okay and okay and okay and okay and okay I mean you know um well uh I mean uh you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we you know so you know um well I mean well like would have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier you know uh um so okay I mean um so and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor well I mean okay I mean well so okay so is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything um like you know I mean so you know okay okay you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any so well so I mean uh you know uh I mean fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit um so so I mean I mean so um okay it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you well well um um so well I mean um all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you know um like uh so I mean so um you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
