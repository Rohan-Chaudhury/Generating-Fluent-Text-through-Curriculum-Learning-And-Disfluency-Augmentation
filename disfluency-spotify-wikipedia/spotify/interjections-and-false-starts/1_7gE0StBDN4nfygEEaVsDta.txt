Hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised a you know bear and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. We are I mean going to take you on a journey blank to the Future and before you and well ask where we are going. You don't need green arrows and that's a good okay thing because you're not going to get them here at least not in this you know episode kind of a topsy-turvy week that saw several Blast from the Past tear okay up the usual FPL narratives and cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s film like references and of course I'm talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace which well Drew assisted one. I believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he could be uh considered a precursor to America's Alonso. And of and of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before but before we get into this any.
