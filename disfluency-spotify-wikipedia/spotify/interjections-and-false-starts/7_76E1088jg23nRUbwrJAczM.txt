Well well I mean you know so okay uh. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want I mean well you know I mean so I mean so to become a man of value so that way other men or other people in I mean um well you know uh um okay general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's so here's so here's so here's so here's so here's so here's so here's uh uh you know I mean so well so the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're okay okay you know I mean I mean like uh a person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going okay so you know uh I mean um I mean to do very well.
