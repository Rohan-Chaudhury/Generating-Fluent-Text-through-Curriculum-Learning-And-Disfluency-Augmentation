Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If uh well you follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know like well that I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of I mean like God. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking at okay like real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using and well so speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart behind this is um well that as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously avoid but we will you know so our mindset that we would go through it will be different. I am so convinced um I mean and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
