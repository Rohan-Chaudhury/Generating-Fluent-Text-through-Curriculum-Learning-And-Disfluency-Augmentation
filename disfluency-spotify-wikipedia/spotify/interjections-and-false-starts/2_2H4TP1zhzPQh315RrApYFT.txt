I'm going uh well to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's see here probably um okay close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to believe that now we um you know always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of that kind of thing okay um usually is what we would talk about when we get together. She's since well like moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a uh um while, but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent the like I mean last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I met you know like her and she has spent all these years doing that. So she's going to share some you know uh of her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have I have I have to apologize uh uh that I have not figured out yet, which I need to do before I okay okay do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
