Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be so explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine well to determine your fate. And the and the reason why I feel that this is such an important so topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny or you know how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of uh what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is so ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to uh become a man of value so that way other men or other people okay in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So you know here's the deal. If you if you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a I mean person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not um going to do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little I mean bit to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take uh five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
