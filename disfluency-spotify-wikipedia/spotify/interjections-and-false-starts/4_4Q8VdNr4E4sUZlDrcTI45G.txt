I think it was my 18th birthday that that I so like like um had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out a uh well okay okay little bit the day up. But for the most part very few uh well I mean I mean things surprise me. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples um you know um I mean must.

Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with I mean um okay like you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
