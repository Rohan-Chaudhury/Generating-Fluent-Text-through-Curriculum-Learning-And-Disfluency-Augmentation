It is Thursday, okay um okay um well March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little pregame okay you know like so well combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs loss um well well well well in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row prior The Beat like I mean okay well like Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to sort of well so like uh you know reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that we're key games um um uh I mean so against teams that were at least on par with them Florida a few points so so okay okay like behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver who was okay like okay um okay battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come up against the team um I mean uh um so and they play three teams on this west coast swing that are out well um um well uh of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string and they got uh well I mean you know okay outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
