We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor to uh I mean okay uh help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding that so like okay well person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then and then and then and then and then if we um so um you know do find them then on the other side of the world or is um uh um I mean too expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now so like you know well for over 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this uh so so okay year. I've been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can um uh so uh help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group I mean um like um here. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can well so okay so ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a like uh you know okay fraction of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
