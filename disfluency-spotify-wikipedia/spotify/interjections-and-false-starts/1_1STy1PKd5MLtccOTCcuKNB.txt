And now here's your host Aaron Richard. Hi everybody Welcome to a brand new episode okay of fun to speculate. I'm your host Aaron Richard and sitting next to me is producer um Vlad. Hi guys. I'm back. Well, yes well, yes you were sick last for I mean the last episode. That's right. Yeah, because in the grand scheme of things we you know recorded it's actually been a while since we like sat here to do and like episode 2 because we recorded so many episodes in like a three-day time well span and we had a nice little break in between and now we have to like catch up and record one like every week or schedule another week of uh insanity. That's okay though. I love this show. I love this show. I want I want this well show. I hope everyone in the world listens to that's a little bit extreme, but, you like know, I hope a lot of people enjoy it. I hope I hope we keep the well topics coming in good thought-provoking ways, and I just hope we always keep it entertaining for you. So, thank you.
