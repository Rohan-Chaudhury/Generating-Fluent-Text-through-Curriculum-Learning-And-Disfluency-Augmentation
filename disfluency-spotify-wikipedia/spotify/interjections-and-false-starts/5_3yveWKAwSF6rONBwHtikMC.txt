Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl Izzie so um well well well Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is so well you know I mean okay he do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? I mean uh okay well well Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had so I mean okay okay okay girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you that you that you that you that you that you have to learn uh you know uh uh I mean especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I so I so I so I so I so I have some days where I like like I mean like you know meant to be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. Like uh so so so. So I so I so I so I so I so I do need to have ways of getting around that which may involve I mean you know uh you know well meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
