Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. We are so so so joined. Once again once again once again once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very special episode. I well I mean uh like these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological career of the I mean I mean you know competitor or the coach that we interview in this case. We interviewed. And since it I mean I mean so was the second time we had him on we'd already covered his career. And so so okay well I got to talk about a lot of things on this show and I had you know I mean like I'd get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on a lot of different okay okay uh things and we kind of went through a couple topics one was his little brother Greg uh like uh just want his fifth State title High School in New York. And so we um like uh talked a little bit about that and then Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
