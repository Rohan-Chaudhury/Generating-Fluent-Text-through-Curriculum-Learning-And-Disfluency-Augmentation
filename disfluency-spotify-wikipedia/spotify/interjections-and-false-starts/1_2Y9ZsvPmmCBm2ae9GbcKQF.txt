Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope you guys like are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode starts. Like. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the so the title of this um podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought I thought you you know know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know catch you know up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded the so past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the okay theme of this podcast should be. So if so if you know notice a lot of you know the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health you know growing up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. Like. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing uh up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having I mean them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
