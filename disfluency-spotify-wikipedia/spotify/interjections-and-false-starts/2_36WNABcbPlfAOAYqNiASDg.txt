If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our show notes well so in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I mean well I opened it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you like uh saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that habit like like of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And so okay. So so uh what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels and we so uh want to remind you that that there is a stream of well-being which you like like are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason are you know uh standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that stream of uh uh well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so you like like is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
