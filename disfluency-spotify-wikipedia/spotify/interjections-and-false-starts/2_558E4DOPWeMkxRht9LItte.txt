Hi late, Friday morning your head spend all those more working on my Saturday night so so talk for tomorrow night, and I'm still doing the history series and also Snow you know well ending with other work and Purim stuff. I always I always I always have a cebit my house. Like so. I'm pouring and now I always try to put together something as I so um mentioned the other day. I'd only time I ever write anything down is Is there like uh something going to shop a super work for husbands or also for Purim believe it uh so or not? Because they always write a five or six or seven page Arturo I mean I mean whatever couple whatever did I like the liver because important you drink, you uh like know know, you know, you can't remember what you're saying. So I have a text like so in front of me. So hopefully you can't go wrong and my son from Israel um well wrote me that sent him a driver toga. For his Yeshiva, and now they're going through the.
