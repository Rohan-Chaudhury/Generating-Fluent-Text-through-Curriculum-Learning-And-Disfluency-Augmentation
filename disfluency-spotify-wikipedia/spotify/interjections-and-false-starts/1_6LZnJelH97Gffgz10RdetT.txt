But first of all, I'd like so to introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm a board certified you know Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see you about 40 50 patients a uh day and the office I'll still go to the hospital and usually have a census. It's I mean been 5 to 15 patients, including ICU and critical heal patients. So literally my patients have I mean been very worried about the core virus and to be honest who is not like been worried about this. Okay?
