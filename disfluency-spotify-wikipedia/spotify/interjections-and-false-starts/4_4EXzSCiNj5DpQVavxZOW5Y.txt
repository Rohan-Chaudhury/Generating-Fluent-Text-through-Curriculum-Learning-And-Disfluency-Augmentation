Hello guys. This is dr. William Cairo Bowl starting the first broadcast that I'm going okay uh um uh to be doing regularly once a week to cover the basic science of the coronavirus and to so um so uh review and sort of restore some of the sanity to the conversation about this this like like so um illness in sort of the electronic discourse that goes About it to try um uh uh I mean to just seal fact from fiction. There's a lot of Buzz right now in the uh well you know you know media. I believe that there's been a very severe, you know response already like so well um well last week in the stock market and Wall Street, and I decided to do this podcast because I realized that.
