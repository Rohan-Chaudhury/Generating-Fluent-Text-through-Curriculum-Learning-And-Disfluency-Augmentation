Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope so hope so hope so hope so hope so hope so hope so hope so hope so you know well well okay um um you know you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode like well I mean like um well so well starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this I mean uh um so so I mean okay I mean podcast is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought like I mean well well well um okay like you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, uh so well so uh like well well you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then but then but then but then but then but then but then but then but then as so okay like um you know uh like you know I recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out well like uh okay I mean well I mean so what the theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice uh you know so like like um well uh a lot of the things that we covered from the past few episode is you know you know uh uh so well you know okay about mental health growing up and things we deal with as a teenager well so well uh well you know okay so or as a young adult. So with that said the new title of the well like so uh um like well like podcast will be basically growing up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast you know well so you know uh like I mean you know should be. So basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast um uh I mean I mean I mean so so uh and basically having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
