You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television and uh um everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to work on like you know their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an hour a day I mean I mean or weeks on end depending on the project those clients might be directors writers okay well producers or cinematographers. It varies considerably depending on the project now our work. On okay I mean the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting things. Sometimes it's color but uh you know not necessarily and that is what the color couch is all about. It's a glimpse so okay behind the curtain of film and television the podcast will talk about color from time to okay well time, but it's really about what brought my clients my guests to the color couch. How did I get to this place in.
