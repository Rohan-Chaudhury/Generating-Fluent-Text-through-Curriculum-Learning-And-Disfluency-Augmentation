Hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly weekly podcast and I like well okay um want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as so far and so well well uh want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made a mistake on the Caroline you know you know you know well Flack part where I was talking about the meme she put out and about so okay okay well be kind and I notice when I listen back to it that I said like you know well uh be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but You know so well okay like my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
