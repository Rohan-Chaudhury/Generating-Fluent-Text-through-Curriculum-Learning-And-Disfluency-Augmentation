Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting so you know um okay as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. So um like uh. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm uh you know like you know and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and moans and moans and moans and moans and groans the sounds of making um um uh well love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath like well like okay of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing you're breathing you're breathing you're breathing you're breathing keeps me high. You make me high I mean you know uh you know higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
