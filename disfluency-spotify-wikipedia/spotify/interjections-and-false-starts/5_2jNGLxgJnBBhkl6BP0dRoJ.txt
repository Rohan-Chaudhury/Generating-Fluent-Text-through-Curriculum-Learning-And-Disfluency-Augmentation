Hello everyone today. I'd like I'd like I'd like I'd like I'd like I'd like to share a simple podcast about effective execution of strategy. So I mean okay like uh I mean their focus is all about execution of strategy. Okay, many people come up with um I mean okay well so great ideas. Great strategies great initiatives and every year they spent countless hours countless um um I mean well okay efforts of prepare. During creating recreating the till business plan or even set of so so like so you know strategic plans and sometimes they also hire very expensive Consultants to do so, but okay um I mean okay so the problem is sometimes most of the effort goes to waste why because uh you know uh you know um they don't really put extra effort to make sure that they do have a systematic approach to follow up follow through.
