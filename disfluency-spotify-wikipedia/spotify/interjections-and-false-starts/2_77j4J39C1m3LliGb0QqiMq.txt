The Bachelors the Bachelors the Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay so well emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading shockingly racist I mean I mean DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully but both fans you know I mean of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation uh well fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake and I mean um eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying how like uh the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the show um I mean taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show uh so Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The okay um show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You um you um you um well can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season you know you know there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and well um then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
