Hello everyone today. I'd like I'd like I'd like to share a simple podcast about effective execution of okay um strategy. So their focus is all about execution of strategy. Okay, many people okay uh come up with great ideas. Great strategies great initiatives and every year they spent so well countless hours countless efforts of prepare. During creating during creating during creating recreating the till business plan uh uh or even set of strategic plans and sometimes they also hire very expensive um I mean Consultants to do so, but the problem is sometimes most of the effort goes so I mean to waste why because they don't really put extra effort to make sure that they do have a systematic approach to follow up follow through.
