Hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with okay um your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you thank you thank you guys so much for tuning well well in in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why when so well and how of this podcast. So before so before so before you decide to listen to me, let me well you know at least help you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about 5 um you know years now. I've worked in many different places. I started off at a nursing home from um uh there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting working at New uh like York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice World, which is really uh okay where I wanted to be I was able to sit with people for longer periods I mean um of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were able to see so you know each other for a bit more than five or ten minutes and you're working well okay in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes in between the well so doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've been here for a while and um well then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
