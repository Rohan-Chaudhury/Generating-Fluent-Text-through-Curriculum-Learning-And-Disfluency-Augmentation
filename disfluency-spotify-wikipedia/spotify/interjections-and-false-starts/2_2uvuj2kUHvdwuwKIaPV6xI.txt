July 16th 1982 was just another normal evening for George Carrillo the 42 like okay year old came home from a long day at work and kissed his girlfriend so okay Juanita Lopez over dinner. He glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun okay well setting over San Jose the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic so you know as it seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself I mean I mean with Heroin just like most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. The uh well drugs burned hot through his veins unlike anything. He'd ever experienced before he began well I mean to hallucinate and eventually passed out into a narcotic induced sleep. The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
