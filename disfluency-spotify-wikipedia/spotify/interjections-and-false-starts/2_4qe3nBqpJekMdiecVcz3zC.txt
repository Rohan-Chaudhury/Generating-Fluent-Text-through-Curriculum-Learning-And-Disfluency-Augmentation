Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this and this and this is my video coaching newsletter and I mean well the topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind of you know um interesting email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and telling me well you know how just in a short period of time. He's in he's in he's in a situation where I uh so guess his he's been married. And he's and he's and he's in the process of getting you know like a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out so well she was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting you know um thing is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, I mean so but the interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his so I mean wife without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
