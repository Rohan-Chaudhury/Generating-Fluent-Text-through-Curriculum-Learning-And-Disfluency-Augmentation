Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works like well hard towards Ascension. So you so you so you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and I am okay well joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the dream speakers okay you know in another episode of tomes of magic. But before but before but before we do, I thought it might so you know be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I am doing uh like fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the woo Kang you know I mean now we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about the Wu-Tang because okay um B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it where you know so he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours wasn't okay you know quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer time and North I mean I mean American summer time do not occur at the same time. So I'm so I'm so I'm like, let's okay like figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm like 9:00 okay okay p.m. Your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I can wake up at like like that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
