Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for so for so for so for so for so for so for I mean I mean like so uh like our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original well you know um okay I mean you know old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one okay like like uh so I mean of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones uh uh well well you know I mean she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when um well I mean okay um like I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems okay you know so well you know well wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
