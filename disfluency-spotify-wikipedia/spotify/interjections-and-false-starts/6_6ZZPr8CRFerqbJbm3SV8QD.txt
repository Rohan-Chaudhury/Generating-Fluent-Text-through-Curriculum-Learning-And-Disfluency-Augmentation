Moans and moans and moans and moans and moans and moans and moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you so um well okay okay like grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree well um you know like you know I mean of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I so so uh I mean well you know calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the so so so um you know I mean sounds of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the you know you know well okay so you know Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make like you know well you know um I mean me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
