Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune out you know you know like you know um well if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I I mean uh like so like so reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in like okay I mean like okay um the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie well um uh so um so was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because you know you know you know okay um you know Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Okay okay you know um uh I mean. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she you know so um like like um has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason well so like I mean um I mean Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see you know you know you know I mean well um no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down so like uh you know I mean um in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily.
