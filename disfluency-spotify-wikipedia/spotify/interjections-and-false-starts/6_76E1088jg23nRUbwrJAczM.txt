Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to like you know okay so um like be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more um like like you know well uh masculine to determine your fate. And the and the and the and the and the and the and the reason why I feel that this is I mean so you know uh well uh such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control um okay I mean um okay you know their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in like okay I mean okay you know like control of what they would like and as a man this is important to uh well like uh like you know your success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you uh well well I mean so like want to become a man of value so that way other men or other people like like so okay so um in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's so um you know okay okay um the deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're uh I mean um um uh like a person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not like okay well uh well I mean going to do very well. Okay, because this video might take me a little bit uh um I mean um well like to explain so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
