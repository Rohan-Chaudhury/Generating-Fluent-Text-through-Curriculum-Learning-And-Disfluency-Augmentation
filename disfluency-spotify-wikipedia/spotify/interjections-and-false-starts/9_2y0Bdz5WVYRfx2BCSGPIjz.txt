And when you had gone up to be uh so I mean I mean so like uh I mean you know with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes I mean uh like okay like um I mean um I mean to him and he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while I I mean like I mean well so like you know uh okay needed to be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. They um like uh okay like you know uh I mean well something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is the attitude of well you know um uh like you know uh um um Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being with God the father in uh like um uh okay you know so so uh prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
