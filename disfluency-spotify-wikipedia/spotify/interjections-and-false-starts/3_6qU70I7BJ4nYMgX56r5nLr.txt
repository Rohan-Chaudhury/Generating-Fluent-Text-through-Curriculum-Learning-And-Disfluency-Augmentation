This does show that the RBA is reading um like so at the economy was at a gentle turning points towards the end of last year so well well was correct. However, it looks like that gentle turning points has turned into an S uh so so turn due to the fires and the coronavirus this data will be used as a baseline to determine how much stimulus.
