Welcome to the March 3rd 2020 edition of coronavirus questions answered with dr. Brian McDonough. Here's okay where we are at this very moment. We know that in the United States I mean the death toll has climbed to 9 in addition. We know we know that those cases are based so in Washington state at a nursing home in Seattle. Most have occurred. The number um of infections in the United States overall have climbed past a hundred. They're scattered uh across 15. It's with 27 cases in Washington state alone. As I mentioned you know that states getting hit very hard, but it's not the only one the nursing home I mean outbreak apparently seated the first case in North Carolina and Wake County resident who had like visited the Washington State nursing home tested positive but is in isolation at home and doing well. So, where are we now what's going on?.
