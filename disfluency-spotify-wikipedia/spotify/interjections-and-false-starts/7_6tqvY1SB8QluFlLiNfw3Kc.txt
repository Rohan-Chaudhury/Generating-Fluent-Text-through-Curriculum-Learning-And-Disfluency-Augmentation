Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires like like I mean you know okay you know you know are so nasty. They are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place I mean uh I mean so well you know so of the Metropolitan. Well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place uh so you know I mean well uh okay due to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the uh like okay so so uh I mean tiebreaker because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I well um okay uh I mean um I mean don't care if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look I mean um uh so like like I mean at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is um I mean like okay I mean um uh the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. You know well uh I mean okay I mean uh. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of uh you know okay so well um you know a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
