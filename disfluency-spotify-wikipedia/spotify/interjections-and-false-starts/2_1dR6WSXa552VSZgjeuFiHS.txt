Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking okay like to you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology and like so health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you have um you know in your bank account. It's about it's about it's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional life uh like spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many questions from people well I mean as I travel the world helping. Some VIP. So this is our time for okay uh us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So here so here so here we go dear well like Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's I mean so actually more vocal about it than I am but it's a little frustrating when I see okay so others getting married and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy okay so for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
