So thankful that you're here today and I so am going to go ahead I normally have you stand to read the scripture um is 19 verses today. So go ahead and sit down and we'll take it slow. God I god I mean bless you. My scripture from today's point of view is Acts chapter 11. This well this well sermon will probably take two weeks to preach. We did we did it last night. The okay Lord showed up. I thought he did till nobody said there was here last night. Yeah. To me to me he showed up. And so we probably won't get to.
