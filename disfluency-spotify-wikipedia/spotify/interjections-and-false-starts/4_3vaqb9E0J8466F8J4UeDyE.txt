Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune out uh okay okay okay if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks like okay okay well ago. I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a um I mean well so production crew Link in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor okay okay well like Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that you know you know uh um theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. You know um okay uh. So let so let so let so let so let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's I mean you know well so not the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, I mean um um well right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. I mean you know uh you know. But as but as but as but as but as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let well um uh like me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got for so well I mean I mean today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did I mean um um um a deep dive on her earlier today.
