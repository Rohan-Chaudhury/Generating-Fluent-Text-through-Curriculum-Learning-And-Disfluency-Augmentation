I do a lot well well uh like well of live videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see them some of so I mean I mean so um you listen to them some of y'all just probably watched for a few minutes and well uh like um so then move on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk about first uh um you know okay I mean uncovered Snapchat. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age of 25 and I mean I mean I mean so um that and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it for real. It's well well like like so pushing it. I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
