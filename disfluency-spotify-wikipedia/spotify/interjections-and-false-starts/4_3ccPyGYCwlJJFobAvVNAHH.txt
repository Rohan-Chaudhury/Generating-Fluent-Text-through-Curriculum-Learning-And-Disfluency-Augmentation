And it's the whole crew here today and we're going to do I mean um um you know this ourselves in a minute, but guys, I realized just the other day that I mean so well like we've been at this for a year. Well, I think this is like episode 56 um I mean you know like or something. Maybe it maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers like you know um uh out there to correct us, you know, occasionally we do say things that well well well so are not correct often speak for yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in well well you know um the course of the show, but that just has because we do is almost zero you know you know um well prep. We just kind of come from wherever we are and we sit down and you know so like I mean and I think most of the time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches uh you know okay you know Us from someplace else.
