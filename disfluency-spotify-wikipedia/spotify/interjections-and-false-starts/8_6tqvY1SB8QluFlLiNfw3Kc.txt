Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are like like um so uh well uh so so nasty. They are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are they are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the uh uh I mean well well um okay uh Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the tiebreak, I mean I mean like okay um uh okay I mean which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it is it the tiebreaker because that would you know okay I mean like well uh uh well make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if technically they're not like so um I mean so um okay I mean in first. All I care about is when you look at the points uh like okay like well like um well it is tied. This very this very this very this very this very this very this very this very this very moment and just the fact that that is the uh um um okay you know like um uh situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat okay um you know uh um um so uh the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
