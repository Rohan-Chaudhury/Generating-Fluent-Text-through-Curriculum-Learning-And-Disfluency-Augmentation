I want you to know that every single person um uh like on planet Earth is not getting it. All right, they may look like they're so um well getting it right because there's maybe one facet of their life that they're really like like like focused on and really paying a lot of attention to but I'm gonna you know um um guarantee like seriously, I'm gonna guarantee that there's other parts of their lives that are sacrificing because of it, right I look at life now is.
