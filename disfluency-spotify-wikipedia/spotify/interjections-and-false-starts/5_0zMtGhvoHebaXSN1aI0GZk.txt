It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a um okay so uh well small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every I mean um like you know okay living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood glucose well you know well um so levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is the movement okay so okay you know okay of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the pancreas. You know like so uh you know. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood enough blood glucose well uh so I mean you know if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone uh I mean okay so um insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin you know I mean like so so these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is you know you know uh um you know insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this use this use this use this use this use this process continues until the well I mean you know so um pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the if the if the if the if the if the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
