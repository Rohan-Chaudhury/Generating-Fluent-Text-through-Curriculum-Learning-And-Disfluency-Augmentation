He'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other religions well well and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to reinvent religion I mean I mean for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while so okay listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which uh um I highly recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the well okay speakers in my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead of so so Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's only I mean well coming out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the like uh only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
