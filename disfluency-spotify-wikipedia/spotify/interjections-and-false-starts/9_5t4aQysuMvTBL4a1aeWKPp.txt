From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me um like well um well um I mean I mean well Julian Morgan's. This is the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And you know okay I mean uh so uh you know uh so today we're looking at one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of I mean I mean like so uh you know you know so uh the 20th century. It's a story about for men and for women who are locked I mean you know uh okay you know uh you know okay uh inside this enormous glass dome for two years just to see what would happen. And as you'd uh okay so uh you know well um like you know imagine it all went a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started to so like well well so um um I mean well get a bit uncomfortable rarely about the four to six month Mark. I think we um so you know I mean I mean I mean uh well so all knew instinctively that if ever anybody opened up physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
