What kind of interesting email uh uh uh so um you know here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and telling like so um okay you know I mean me how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation where well uh well well like you know I guess his he's been married. And he's and he's and he's and he's and he's and he's and he's in the process of getting a you know you know you know well um uh divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she so well you know you know um like was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing is he's I mean so you know um uh you know completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the interesting thing uh um I mean well you know like is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife without any kind well well well I mean uh um of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
