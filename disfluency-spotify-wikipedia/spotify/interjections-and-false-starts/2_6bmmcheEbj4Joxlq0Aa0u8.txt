At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over I mean you know a Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about well you know six feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on I mean well the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw okay you know Hat as it went downstream. My he my he my he thought I'll bet that person who lost that you know uh hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around well uh the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to his um like surprise. Here comes here comes here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very strange. Uh I mean. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of uh I mean the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came it came it came back Upstream um okay yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the finally the finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
