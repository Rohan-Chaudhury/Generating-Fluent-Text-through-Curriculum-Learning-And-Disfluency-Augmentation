And the reason why I feel that this is such an important so I mean well okay um I mean okay well topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their uh you know well okay um so um um Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control like um okay well you know um well you know of what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. Um you um you um you um you um you um you um you um you um you know okay well I mean uh you know um. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not and not and not and not and not and not and not and not and not only that if you want I mean I mean um okay like uh I mean you know to become a man of value so that way other men or other people okay uh okay okay like I mean well okay in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's so I mean well you know so I mean you know um the deal.
