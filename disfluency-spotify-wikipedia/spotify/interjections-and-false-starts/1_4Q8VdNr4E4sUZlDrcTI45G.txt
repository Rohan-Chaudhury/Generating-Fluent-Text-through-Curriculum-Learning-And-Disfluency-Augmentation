Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. Like. I guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that that you know I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out like a little bit the day up. But for the most part very few things um surprise me. It is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have I mean felt here towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting um in verse 19 following it says this and the evening of that first day of so the week when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the okay Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you after okay he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
