Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are so um uh um uh so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the well um like you know uh Metropolitan. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the tiebreak, you know uh okay uh you know which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it is it is it is it is it is it the tiebreaker because that would make the you know like like so uh most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if technically they're I mean so you know I mean um not in first. All I care about is when you look at the points like I mean um okay uh it is tied. This very this very this very this very this very this very moment and just the fact that that is the situation uh uh well well uh we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the Flyers beat uh um well I mean I mean the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
