What a what a what a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about well uh the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and you know okay plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from so I mean a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to um uh the third row podcast. I came I came I came up the idea for this episode. We were just well well recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for so well the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get okay well these really cool looking new tire. Hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already um okay cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for I mean well these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it well okay perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. Like I mean. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort you know like of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that uh so sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package uh so is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
