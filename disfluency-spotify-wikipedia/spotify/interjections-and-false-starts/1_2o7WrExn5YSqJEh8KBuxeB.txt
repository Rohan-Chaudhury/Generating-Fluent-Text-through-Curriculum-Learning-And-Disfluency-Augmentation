Hello everyone and welcome to astral ashes. It is pi C season, and you know I'm Lisa Marie and I'm Andy talarico. Welcome to astral ashes. We are going um to be serenading you with a poem to start. So Andy take it okay away. I'm going to be reading a poem by one of the Lisa and my uh favorite poets Christina Rossetti and we thought the dreamy quality of this and the sort you know of fantasy vs. Reality aspect really spoke to pies. Season so season so this is called I well dream of you to wake by Christina Rossetti. I dream of you to wake I mean would that I might dream of you and not wake but Slumber on nor fine with you know dreams. The dear the dear companion gone as summer ended summer birds take flight and well happy dreams. I hold I hold you full and night I blush again who waking look so one brighter than sunniest day that ever shown and happy dreams. Your.
