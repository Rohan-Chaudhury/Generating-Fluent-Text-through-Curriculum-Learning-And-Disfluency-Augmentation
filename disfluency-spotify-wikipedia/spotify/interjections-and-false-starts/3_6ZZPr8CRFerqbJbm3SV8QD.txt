Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as okay so like we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You okay uh you know come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm uh so um and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of um like I mean making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the you know I mean you know Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me um so um high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
