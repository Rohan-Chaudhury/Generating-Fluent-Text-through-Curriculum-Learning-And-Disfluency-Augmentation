The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that uh okay well so were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how well um you know like we do it how we get it out there how we record it. I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean okay uh. And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we um like you know uh would have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier and I mean uh you know well it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is well okay well um by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything like you know uh you know you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy okay well I mean like recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it um I mean you know you know on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all okay uh I mean uh the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound good which okay well okay you know you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
