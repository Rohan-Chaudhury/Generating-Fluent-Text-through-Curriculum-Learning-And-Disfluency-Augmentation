Welcome everyone to the inaugural episode of Finding Fergus who is Fergus you may ask that I mean well um is my best friend since the second grade when I was seven years um um so old Nate nasty couple of nicknames. He had gotten Natan a sty Fergus Ace like well uh Qbert Boos. Oh the clown the guy has all sorts of nicknames and I so you know you know assure you I'm going to tell you those stories from all over. The years uh like well but the reason we're looking for Nate nasty or finding Fergus is because he has I mean um well a propensity to disappear and I'm not saying like three four weeks at a time I mean uh so or maybe even a couple days when I get my sad boy moments. I'm talking six um um I mean months to a year. This man can disappear at times. He has a lot um you know I mean of stuff going on in way of not knowing what's going on and he often finds himself in.
