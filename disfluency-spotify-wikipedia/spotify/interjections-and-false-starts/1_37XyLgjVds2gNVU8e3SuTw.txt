This is this is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's begin in the okay name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen was called like a mind all those we promise to pray for. I think the most exhilarating uh truth is that before the world was created God already had you and I uh in mind each with our own particular place in the grand plan of history that no you know other person can or ever will take we were designed for this role and only we uh can fulfill it and if we don't no one will Father favor and his spiritual like conferences rights. No two of us are alike. God saw a specialty in US eternally, I mean it was this specialty which he loved it is this specialty which decides our place and our work and his creation.
