The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that uh uh uh like uh so uh uh so were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how so like so okay like you know like um um we do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you you know you know okay like okay like well you know um know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we well well uh I mean so uh like um well would have had when we first started out this would have been way way easier well okay I mean well like so so well well and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is well you know okay I mean you know I mean um like uh by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. In one um well you know you know well you know well so I mean place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording so okay like uh like well so like like equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on your uh uh okay well I mean so uh um so phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the creation tools. I mean you know well I mean well okay well I mean uh. You need to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if so well like I mean so so well so like we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
