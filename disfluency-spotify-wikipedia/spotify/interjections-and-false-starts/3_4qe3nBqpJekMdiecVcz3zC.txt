Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this and this and this and this is my video coaching newsletter and the like like so topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind of interesting um I mean okay email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work uh um uh and telling me how just in a short period of time. He's in a okay okay I mean situation where I guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of getting like okay um a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found he found he found he found out she well uh you know was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting like okay okay thing is he's completely changed his approach. He still he still he still he still moving forward with the divorce, but the uh so uh interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife well like I mean without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
