Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so tune out if you want so um to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported I reported I reported that Madison Pruitt I mean um with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description uh um and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly uh uh going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced well I mean as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks you know okay after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be the uh I mean winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have like like been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no um okay other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the like you know comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're I mean I mean new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier you know you know today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check out uh um our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
