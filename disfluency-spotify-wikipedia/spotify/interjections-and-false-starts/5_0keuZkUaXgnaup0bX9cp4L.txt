Hi, POTUS. I hope you're doing well. Today's episode is when did disability become so you know like you know okay um taboo? So I speak to you the amazing Sophie Butler who is a fitness uh well um so I mean influencer and also a wheelchair user we discuss her accident and how she uh well like well okay came to be disabled or to have a disability. And also the way that well so um I mean so the World perhaps disables us more than injuries accidents or disabilities that were born with may do okay uh like so so which might seem like a confusing concept. Act but it's basically the idea of ableism you know um okay uh like and how the world is set up for people who are able-bodied as opposed to you know like like well so those of us who perhaps can't function in a very specific way. It well you know uh uh um was so inspiring to people Sophia, and I think it's a really interesting conversation. I like so you know like like really hope you enjoy it as always.
