Perhaps the most deceptively titled episode The Origin of Species was not actually about you know the fucking word genus species. But back to chapter 24 to see what it so actually is about today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to biology I mean for bastards teaching biology and the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm uh your host John Doe D. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP uh Biology one chapter at a time this week. We're on the chapter 24, which is I mean titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
