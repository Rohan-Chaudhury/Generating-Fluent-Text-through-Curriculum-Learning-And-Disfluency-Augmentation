Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one well like place suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven so so and filled the whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to so okay be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All well so of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began. To speak in other tongues um I mean as the spirit enabled them. Now there was staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment.
