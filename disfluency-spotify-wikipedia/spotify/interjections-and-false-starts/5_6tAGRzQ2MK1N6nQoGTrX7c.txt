Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through a well I mean um like well kemetic meditation. So the so the so the so the so the so the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down like you know uh well well on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can like uh so you know uh also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make so like I mean um you know sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall you know you know well well um if you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your you know I mean you know you know um feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find so well uh I mean so either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find like well well uh well your navel. So with so with so with so with so with so with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
