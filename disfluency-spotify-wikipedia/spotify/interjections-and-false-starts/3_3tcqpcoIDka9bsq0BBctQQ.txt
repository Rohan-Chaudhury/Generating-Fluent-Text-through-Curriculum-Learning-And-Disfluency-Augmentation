It doesn't make me afraid I did not injure myself. So there is no need well I mean so to worry or I don't need to worry that there's damage. And anyway, this is like um you know just what I'm feeling and I know it'll pass at some point and movement like like like really seems to make all the difference which I think is so cool. Hello, everybody today. Um you know well. We are joined by Jenna and she's one of my clients and she's actually uh so I mean turned into a quite a dear friend of mine during our time together. Okay um uh. And so today we are going to be having a conversation about her journey that like uh okay led up to her and I working together where she's at. Now what she I mean I mean okay likes about our time together things that you can't stand also perhaps we'll see I mean like like where it goes. But the goal of today is to highlight her journey in the hopes of connecting.
