Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like not like not like so um a regular Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I like you know have had some shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share okay I mean of one of which is the fact that I have literally not had a job well well for the past. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from you know you know like a gig here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and so well my bank account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for um like a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
