So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I have well a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I had been like feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it can be sometimes you know and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this pattern of okay just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I uh know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a I mean loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to like me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been so you know powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
