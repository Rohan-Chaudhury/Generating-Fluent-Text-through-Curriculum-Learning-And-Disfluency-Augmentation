You can learn more about on my free training over at Dropship webinar.com. I'll like so post a link to that in the the description by the way Dropship well so webinar.com, but once you know all that stuff and you kind of understand how like like to build the business then the question is, well, what do you actually have uh uh to get done before you make that website on Shopify before you contact your first supplier before um like you get your first sale?
