Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the Gospel you know uh so reading from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an exegesis so I mean I mean of the literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter okay so uh 5 verse 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how I mean you know well it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I I mean like you know say this to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you know okay like you in this way. You will be sons of your father in Heaven for uh so so he causes his sun to rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
