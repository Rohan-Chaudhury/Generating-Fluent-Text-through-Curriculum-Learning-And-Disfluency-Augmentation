He'll and he'll and he'll and he'll and he'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and other I mean you know um uh religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to reinvent religion like you know uh you know for myself. Okay story time. I was driving to visit a friend while listening to to so okay um uh the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I highly recommend for fans so I mean well um of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the speakers in my car. My like uh you know um current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead of Music I've had you know uh like like to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's only coming out of I mean I mean I mean so one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
