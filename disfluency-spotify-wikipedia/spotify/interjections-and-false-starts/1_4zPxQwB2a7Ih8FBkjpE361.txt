Due to the graphic consequences of today's disaster listener discretion is advised Extreme Caution is I mean advised for listeners under 13 at 3 p.m. On August 20th, 1910 Forest ranger Ed Pulaski uh and a ragtag team of young volunteers were clearing brush on a ridge above the town like of Wallace, Idaho. It was a hot day but the sun was obscured by you know smoke Pulaski and his Squad were on the front lines of an effort to combat. You know. Thousands of small wild fires blazing along the northern reaches of the Rocky Mountains for weeks. Okay. He and his comrades in the newly formed US Forest Service had relentlessly cleared swaths of well forest to Halt the fires, they were overworked and understaffed. But many members I mean of the service still believe the situation was under control but Pulaski worried the well worst was yet to come when smoke from the fires blocked out the sun around 3 p.m.
