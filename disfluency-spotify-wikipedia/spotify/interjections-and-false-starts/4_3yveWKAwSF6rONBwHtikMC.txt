Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl Izzie like um so uh Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he do you well you know um well find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, it's very you know so I mean like tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl duties, I mean okay uh like but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing gcses like uh okay you know and a-levels. So I so I so I so I so I have some days where I meant to be in three okay like like I mean meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have ways of so I mean okay like getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
