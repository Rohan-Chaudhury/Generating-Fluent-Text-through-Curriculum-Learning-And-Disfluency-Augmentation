So at this point we've at least had a couple like you know okay like okay you know days to digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're I mean uh um well uh I mean going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. Well like well I mean um uh. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you well so okay I mean so well cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are these are these are these are these are these are these are Incredibly you know well like okay so I mean talented athletes. I mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an well uh well so I mean like example, but they're / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you you know like well you know so okay wildly swinging your view of a player but we did learn some things some okay um well you know well I mean players had much better showing than others.
