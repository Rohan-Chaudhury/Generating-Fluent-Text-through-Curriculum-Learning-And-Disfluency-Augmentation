Keep it up permanently. Let me tell you something. You already know the world ain't I mean all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I so don't care how tough you are. It will beat you to your knees and keep well you there permanently. If you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard well as life, but it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you so can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving forward. So. That's how that's how winning is done. Well, if well, if you know what you're worth then go out and uh get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing um fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody so cowards do that. And that ain't you you better than that. It's about how hard uh you can get hit and keep moving forward. Yo. Yo yo, yo yo, it's your boy Evan. Those were little bit of words from Rocky.
