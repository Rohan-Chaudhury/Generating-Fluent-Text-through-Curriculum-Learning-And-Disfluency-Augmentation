Perhaps the most deceptively titled episode The Origin of Species was not actually about the well um uh like well I mean well you know I mean fucking word genus species. But back to chapter 24 to see what it actually is so like okay like um well I mean okay okay about today. So I hope you enjoy. Welcome to biology for bastards teaching biology and well okay uh like well uh so um well the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John Doe D. Thanks like so so like um well uh well like for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter at a time this so well uh well I mean you know like um uh week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
