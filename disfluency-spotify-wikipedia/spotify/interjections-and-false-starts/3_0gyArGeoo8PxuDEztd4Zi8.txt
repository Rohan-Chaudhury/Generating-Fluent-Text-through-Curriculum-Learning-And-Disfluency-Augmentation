Hello, my hello, my hello, my hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on vale. You know well um. I was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder song well you know you know as the best song on the planet. Can you beat it? And all you know you know I mean it did for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me so okay I mean of all time, which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, like I mean uh first of all when you come up with a song lyric like that, you've got um well well to go. Um, man, I've nailed life love is in need of Love uh okay I mean Today and He's my favorite Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and I mean like I mean listening to it the message on it. Is that Love's in Need of um um okay Love today? We need to give the love back to ourselves to for loved it. It's so well well that cycle and I wanted to get you to consider that you can apply this uh so you know to lots of things in your life and fundamentally you are in need of you today. Like so okay. So put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
