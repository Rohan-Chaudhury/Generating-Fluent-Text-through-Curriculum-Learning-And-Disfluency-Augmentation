Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or um I mean you know okay try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that you know I mean I mean you know going on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind uh well uh well this podcast is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being so um I mean I mean real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the opposite. I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean so you know uh. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to grow so um um you know through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder that like you know you know like in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when our you know I mean so I mean backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
