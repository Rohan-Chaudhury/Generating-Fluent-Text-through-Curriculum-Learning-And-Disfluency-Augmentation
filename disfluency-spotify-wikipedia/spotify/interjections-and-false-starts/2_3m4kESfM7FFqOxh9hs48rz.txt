Hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree okay well and I became good friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal like like State Long Beach Bree was actually taken the course because she was preparing to okay uh apply to occupational therapy school. She has recently been admitted and we are so like uh proud of her Bree also has a background in kinesiology, which is what she okay like studied for her undergraduate major and when she was still studying that she also played okay like basketball NCAA Division II at Cal State East Bay. So this woman has a um like lot of knowledge about not only how to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. Well you know. We're going to dive into some of the ways in which she's faced like um some really tough situations and she's had to pull out that inner strength so I mean to keep going in the face of some situations where she did not think um uh she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
