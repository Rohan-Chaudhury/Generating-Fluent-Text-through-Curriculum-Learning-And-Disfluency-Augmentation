Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So um I mean uh you know for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old okay so well like school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one I mean um so like of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she saw well well so you know in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was about so um I mean well nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly um so you know I mean inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so okay uh so um before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
