It is it is it is it is it is it is it is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a okay uh I mean okay okay uh small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by well you know okay okay well you know every living cell. If there if there if there if there if there if there if there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough um um uh uh okay like energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, um um uh well so I mean which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood okay I mean so you know okay so flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. You know um uh well uh well. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas well well uh like okay well releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect okay uh um you know I mean you know the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form uh um okay well I mean um of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this okay so so you know okay okay process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
