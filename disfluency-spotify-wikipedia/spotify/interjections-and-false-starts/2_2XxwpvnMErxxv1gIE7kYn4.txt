What's going on everybody? Welcome back to the quickie. This is Luke and I'm like um going to talk about a Convent not really conversation. Let's talk let's talk let's talk about a statement from I mean so Brandi Love about her and her her husband's relationship whether it's an open relationship so uh with that. I don't know how it will have fun. Alright, stay tuned. Welcome uh well to the quickie and first before we get into the show, if you haven't like uh heard about anchor before downloading it this time, it is the easiest way to make a podcast uh I mean and I encourage you to make your own podcast. It's fun and it's free. It's uh I mean free to download is free to be chord you talk. Anyway, you anyway, you anyway, you have conversations. Anyway, so well why not record it and make money while you're doing it. There are creation tools like uh that allow you to record and edit your podcast right from your phone or your so so computer. Anchor will distribute your podcast for you. So I can be heard on Spotify Apple podcast and other.
