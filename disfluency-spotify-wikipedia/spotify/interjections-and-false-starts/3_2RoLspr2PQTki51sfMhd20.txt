In the year leading up to the 2020 election. We're counting down the biggest scandals well uh okay in American political history. This is number 36 Carol Hubbard Junior. The former Congressman you know uh well was charged with three felonies after illegally using his campaign fund and Congressional staff for so uh so personal use 56 year old former Congressman Carol Hubbard Junior thought he was getting uh um you know ready to participate in a sting mission for the FBI the past few years on well um okay the hill had been tough for him pesky Agents from the bureau had been you know um you know poking around his Finance records. They were definitely looking for something no matter Hubbard thought um well um he'd outrun his cooked books with a little quid pro quo. He could you know so well play nice for a couple months and help the FBI. Investigate lobbying in Libya, then they'd see he was worth his salt.
