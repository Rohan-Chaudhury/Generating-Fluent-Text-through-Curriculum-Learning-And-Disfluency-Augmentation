And why okay so didn't somebody teach them do their taxes what you were taught that in school. Well well. It's called basic math in first grade or 2nd grade. They taught you how to uh like add and subtract numbers. That's how you do taxes. You line them up in um well a column you add some together, you subtract some the Part about that so um is you were taught how to follow directions. There's directions at the top of uh well the paper. You were supposed to read them. You read those directions and uh you know you follow them. So you were taught that in school that was in elementary school um okay the fact that you can't follow directions and do simple math doesn't mean that um okay you weren't taught that in school.
