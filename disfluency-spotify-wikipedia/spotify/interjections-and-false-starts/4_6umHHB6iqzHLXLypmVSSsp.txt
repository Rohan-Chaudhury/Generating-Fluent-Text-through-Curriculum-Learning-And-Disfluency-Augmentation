Hello friends, thank you for listening in today the theme of this first episode like like well you know in a series is one that I consider really foundational as you know, my goal with I mean um uh well pondering purple is to help missionaries kids and the people who love them to better um uh I mean uh understand the complexities that drive us the gifts and the challenges the joys uh uh well I mean and the frustrations of growing up in a multicultural Ministry focused and complicated environment. Ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there okay I mean well so was a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that came from growing uh well so I mean up between worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and the hard then okay you know okay I mean I went to a school for missionaries kids in Germany when I was in ninth I mean so well um grade, and I quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite been able so okay uh okay to put a finger on we're not just in me my friends at okay you know okay like Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
