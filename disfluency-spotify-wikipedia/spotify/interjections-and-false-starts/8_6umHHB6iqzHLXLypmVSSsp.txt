Hello friends, thank you for listening in today the theme of this first episode in a I mean like like well like well I mean I mean series is one that I consider really foundational as you know, my goal with uh um like so okay well um uh pondering purple is to help missionaries kids and the people who love them to better um you know uh uh you know okay like well understand the complexities that drive us the gifts and the challenges the joys and uh uh okay so okay like I mean uh the frustrations of growing up in a multicultural Ministry focused and complicated environment. Ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there ain't there was like so uh I mean so uh uh um a time when I wasn't aware of the differences that came from growing up between well uh I mean uh like okay I mean I mean worlds and of the push and pull of the happy and the hard then I went to you know like okay so like like you know I mean a school for missionaries kids in Germany when I was in ninth grade, and I you know well so well um I mean like you know quickly came to realize that those indefinable differences. I hadn't quite been able to put uh uh like uh you know like okay uh a finger on we're not just in me my friends at Black Forest Academy exhibited really similar traits. That's where my fascination with MKS and they're complex identity begins.
