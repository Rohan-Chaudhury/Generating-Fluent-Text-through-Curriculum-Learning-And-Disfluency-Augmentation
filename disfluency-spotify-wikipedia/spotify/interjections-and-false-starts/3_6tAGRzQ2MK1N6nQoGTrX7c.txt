Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be well I mean so going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be I mean like um laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You I mean you know okay can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to you know you know well make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you okay I mean well have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your like uh uh feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So okay um okay once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want like you know you know you to find your navel. So with so with so with so with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
