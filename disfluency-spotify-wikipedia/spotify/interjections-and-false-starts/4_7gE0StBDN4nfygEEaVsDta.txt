Hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised I mean okay so I mean a bear and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. So uh you know so. We are going to take you on a journey blank to the Future and before well well um okay you and ask where we are going. You don't need green arrows and that's a good uh so you know you know thing because you're not going to get them here at least not in this episode okay so like so kind of a topsy-turvy week that saw several Blast from the Past tear up the well well so um usual FPL narratives and cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s film references and of you know like I mean like course I'm talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace which Drew assisted I mean I mean I mean so one. I believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he could like you know um um be considered a precursor to America's Alonso. And of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before we get into this any.
