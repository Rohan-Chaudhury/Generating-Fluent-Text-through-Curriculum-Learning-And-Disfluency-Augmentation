Cough now, you know, there's this whole part of uh it that says, you know, you have to collaborate and do all those great like things. But there's also the part of you doing this goal this particular um goal by yourself, but me how far now you know, so I mean, we're just um we're just going to flow today and we just hope that you guys get well what you need to from this podcast because the truth is sometimes the goal is not necessarily.
