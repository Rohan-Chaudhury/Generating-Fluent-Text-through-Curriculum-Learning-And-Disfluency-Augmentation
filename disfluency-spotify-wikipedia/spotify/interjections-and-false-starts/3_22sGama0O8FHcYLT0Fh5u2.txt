Titanic's will titanic's will titanic's will titanic's will gain produced by Games workshop. Okay so I mean. This is the second ever podcast I've ever made. So I hope this isn't too um you know uh horrible and still trying to find my feet. So I hope you are bear with um you know well the bad editing in places. I've done my best to fix stuff and re-recorded well you know uh sections that were terrible. Anyway, let's get on with the show in this show. I cover you know um um recent news and questions that I've been asked by the community. I then spend the rest I mean so well of the show focus on a conversation about maniples the basic building blocks of the game. You know okay okay. I was intending to spend some time discussing how to use them as narrative well like like devices, but following some feedback and realizing have a lot of Basic Ground um I mean uh to cover I'll be focusing on the man of courses primarily from gaming perspective. This like you know you know is a longer episode than I initially planned and you'll probably notice a slight um you know well change in Styles throughout the main section of the shug. This week work was I mean uh so a lot busier than I was expecting and much for my normal recording time was taken by.
