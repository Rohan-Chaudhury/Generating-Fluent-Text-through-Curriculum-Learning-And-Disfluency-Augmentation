It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small well uh like okay well um you know uh um range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by well uh so uh um you know uh uh well every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if like okay I mean I mean um you know okay so like blood glucose levels are too high. This can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can this can have a negative impact on osmosis, uh well um okay so I mean um I mean you know which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood well like so well you know um so uh uh flows through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is um uh so well like you know you know um well a high concentration. Enough blood glucose if the concentration of blood glucose is I mean so okay so you know so uh you know so too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the bloodstream the liver well you know I mean uh okay okay okay um um and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen okay okay so I mean I mean well um um okay glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use you know okay you know like um like well well I mean this process continues until the pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
