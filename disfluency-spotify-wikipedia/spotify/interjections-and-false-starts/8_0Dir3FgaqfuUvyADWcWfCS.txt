So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one well I mean uh uh uh you know um you know of my mother's favorite. So I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I think it was one of the first ones she you know uh like so okay um well you know saw in the theater growing up. I was I was I was I was I was I was I was I was I was introduced to this movie when I was like um so you know I mean I mean like okay about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly um you know you know you know I mean okay um well inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
