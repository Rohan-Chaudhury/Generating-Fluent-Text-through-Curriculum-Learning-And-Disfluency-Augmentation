Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had girl Izzie uh okay well you know you know um Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he do I mean so you know I mean uh I mean you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, like you know I mean okay you know okay it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had like like okay well um um girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you that you that you that you that you that you that you have to learn especially when doing you know okay you know well like so gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I meant to be in three you know so um I mean well uh meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So I do need to have ways of like so you know um so okay getting around that which may involve meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
