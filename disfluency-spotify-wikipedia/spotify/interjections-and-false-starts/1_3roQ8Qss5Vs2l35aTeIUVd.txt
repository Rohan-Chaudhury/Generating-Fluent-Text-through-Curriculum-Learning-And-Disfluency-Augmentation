Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the so things well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me like that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six you know of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit um on a couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on it and uh dance on it. Do not do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's uh it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but you know they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the so couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. Okay. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
