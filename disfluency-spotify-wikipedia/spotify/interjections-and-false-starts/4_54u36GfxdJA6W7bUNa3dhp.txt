Welcome ladies welcome. So I want to talk a little bit about Snapchat texting and facetime. Well like well I mean. We all probably have those devices on our phones. I do a lot of live so um um so videos, of course for My Spa y'all. We'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see them some of you listen to I mean I mean like you know them some of y'all just probably watched for a few minutes and then move um well um uh on or whatever. That's fine. But I want to talk about first uncovered snapchat. Um so you know like. Okay, so I feel like if you're over the age of 25 and that like okay like so and that's pushing it 25 is just pushing it for real. It's pushing it. I mean so so you know. I'm not sure it Snapchat something you should be like doing okay that to me. It's just very.
