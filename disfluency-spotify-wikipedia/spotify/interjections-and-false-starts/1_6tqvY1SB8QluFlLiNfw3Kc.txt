Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are so so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the metropolitan. Like. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the uh tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would well make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if you know technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you look at the I mean points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact that that is the like situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so happy. So the okay Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half of a well back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
