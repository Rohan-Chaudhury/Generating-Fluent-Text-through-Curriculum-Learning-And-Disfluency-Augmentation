Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as we I mean breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You come I mean and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and you fall to well your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making love my breath you know is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath your breath the Breath of Life kissing you know my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher than the you know mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
