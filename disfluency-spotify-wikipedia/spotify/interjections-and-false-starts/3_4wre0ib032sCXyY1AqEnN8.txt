Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues or try to well well um create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going on in the well like well world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast is to speak okay uh uh to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being real being vulnerable and okay you know okay being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's quite the opposite. We believe I mean like um that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue to grow through our struggle well well you know and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder that in our Darkest Hours when we well okay uh can't see the way out when our backs are up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
