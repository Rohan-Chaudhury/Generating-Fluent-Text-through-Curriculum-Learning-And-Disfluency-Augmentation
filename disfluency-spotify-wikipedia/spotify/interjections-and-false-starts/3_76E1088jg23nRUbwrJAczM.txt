Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining I mean I mean um to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine uh uh um to determine your fate. And the and the and the and the reason why I feel that this is such an important um uh uh topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny or like you know okay how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of what they like I mean um would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is this is this is this is like uh um ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to become like so you know a man of value so that way other men or other people in general you know well well can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If well um like you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit so I mean like there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very well. Okay, I mean so you know because this video might take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen um you know so grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
