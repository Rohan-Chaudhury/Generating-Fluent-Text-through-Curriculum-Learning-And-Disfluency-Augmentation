Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a regular mom. Um well um so I mean. I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some shit so I mean I mean um so on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of which is so you know you know you know you know the fact that I have literally not had a job for the past. Really long time you know so um um well and like my adult life probably aside from like a gig here and well okay like um um a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my bank account. I have not you know uh okay okay well consistently been working and I think that's for a few reasons. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
