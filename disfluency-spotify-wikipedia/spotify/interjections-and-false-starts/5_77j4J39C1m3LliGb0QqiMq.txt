The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay okay so I mean well okay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her I mean uh like you know okay reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled um so okay okay you know Tastefully but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion so so well okay like on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have um okay like like uh its cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user and like I mean like like so ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying so I mean you know okay like and the show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at okay um like like so The Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic um I mean um you know like environments. The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of uh I mean um I mean well having a villain. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every okay like um uh um single season there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity so I mean um you know okay and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
