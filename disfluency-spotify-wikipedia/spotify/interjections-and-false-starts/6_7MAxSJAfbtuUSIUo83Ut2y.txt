What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was you know so like so you know uh a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the roof. Like um um okay you know well. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably a fire I mean um okay um so um hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number one problem and so okay okay so okay you know really it was just bingo. So anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody could win and there were I mean so you know you know like um Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too sure what um um you know um okay well is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that um so you know well okay like but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was um I mean uh well well I mean getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand um uh so like I mean like dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
