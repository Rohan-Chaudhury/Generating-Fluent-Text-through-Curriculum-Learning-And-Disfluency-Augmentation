Hi and welcome to the fort down podcast. I'm Ben. I'm so and okay like we're here to talk about American football. So I so I so I go into the NFL after uh you know the demo for Madden 2009 was advertised on my Xbox that which was like like the one with Drew Brees on the cover. Okay, because it won the Super Bowl and I mean um the AFC Championship Game the 2009 game between the Colts and the Jets. This was the um uh game that you could play. So yeah, I enjoyed the demo and so you play okay so that demo. That was your first experience. Yeah, pretty much why you chose you know you know to be a broadcaster? Yeah, because I chose to be a Broncos fan you know so because well quite frankly because I have a horse and I went and well so I didn't like I felt pretty scummy to be in like, you know, yeah, I don't like all this.
