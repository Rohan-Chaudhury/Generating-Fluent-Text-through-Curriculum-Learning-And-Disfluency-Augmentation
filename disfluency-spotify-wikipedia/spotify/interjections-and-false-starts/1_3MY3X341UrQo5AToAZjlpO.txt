Thank you thank you for so tuning in again for another week of Mayhem craziness insanity fuckery. If this is like your first time listening to the podcast shame on you start from the fucking so beginning. You'll be lost. What if you don't like to listen to rules or obey like them you can continue to listen to it, but you should pour yourself a drink so because I like to say fuck a lot and every time I say fuck you should drink or smoke or whatever.
