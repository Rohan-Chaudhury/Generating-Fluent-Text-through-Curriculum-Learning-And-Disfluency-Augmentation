It's been it's been you know a pretty eventful like week, I guess since we last recorded. Yeah, and we recorded uh this coming episode. This guests this guests really really early. We did we did. This so this so is actually hints to everybody at our behind-the-scenes process, but this little Snippets recorded uh after your episode. Halftime, so we actually did have our guests on you know a little bit earlier this week. Yeah, when yeah, when he was here because of the like way that you know, this Gus could make it around but you know, we're recording the I mean intro after we record the actual episode. Typically. We like to record the you know intro this this snippet part without the guest even being around. Yeah. So uh it just the way it works. So usually we recorded before the guest shows up this like last step the set this guess we didn't have time to yeah. But anyways, how was how was your week bit how how things been for you?.
