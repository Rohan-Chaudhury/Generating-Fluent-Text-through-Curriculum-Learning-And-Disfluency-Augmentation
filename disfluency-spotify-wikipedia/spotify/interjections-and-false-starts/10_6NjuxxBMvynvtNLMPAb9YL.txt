Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a uh so you know so well I mean so okay uh you know release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the so okay uh like uh okay uh okay well like choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just listened to the um um well you know uh well uh like you know um songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm in the shower um I mean you know well uh I mean so I mean uh um when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm training gym, I just try okay uh so like I mean you know like okay like I mean and listen to the music as many times as possible, but I'm not even thinking like I mean I mean I mean like uh um okay like so about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's just filled music and like you know so so uh well well I mean uh uh what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks uh so so uh so I mean so uh so I mean will come up and you don't know what that's going to be or when it will well well okay you know I mean I mean like you know you know okay be but it just happens after you listen to it for a while and you know okay okay well you know so like you know well uh then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when you know so okay you know I mean um I mean um you know you know those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music. So like uh you know uh um so so you know so you know those little moments that your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
