And I mean okay well uh uh well you know like well I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of so um well um so like like uh okay making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath you know so uh so so I mean like like uh of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high so okay you know like okay you know well like so higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
