This is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's begin you know I mean in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen was uh like called a mind all those we promise to pray for. I think the most exhilarating truth is okay okay that before the world was created God already had you and I in mind so okay each with our own particular place in the grand plan of history that no other person like um can or ever will take we were designed for this role and only okay like we can fulfill it and if we don't no one will Father favor and his spiritual so you know conferences rights. No two of us are alike. God saw a specialty in US you know I mean eternally, it was this specialty which he loved it is this specialty which decides our place and our work and his creation.
