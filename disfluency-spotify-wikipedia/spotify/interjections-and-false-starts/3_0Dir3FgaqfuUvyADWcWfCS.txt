Hi, this hi, this hi, this hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So for I mean I mean I mean our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old school so uh like one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one of okay so you know my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first ones she uh um you know saw in the theater growing up. I was I was I was I was introduced to this movie when okay uh um I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems wildly um well well inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
