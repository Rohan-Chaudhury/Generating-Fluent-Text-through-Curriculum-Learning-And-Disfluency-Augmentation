I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of living I mean like um well like with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived problems well like um you know like and worries going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. The simple um so you know you know I mean fact that we all only have one life and that none of us are promised okay okay like you know so another day on this beautiful planet. We all we all we all we all we all we all call home regardless. Of our of our of our of our of our of our you know well um uh um current health status after all would you seriously stay in the job you so well well so you know hate or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you if you if you if you if you if you truly felt your life could uh um um like so end next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you uh uh so like you know happy and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this groundbreaking podcast. Like so uh uh okay. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
