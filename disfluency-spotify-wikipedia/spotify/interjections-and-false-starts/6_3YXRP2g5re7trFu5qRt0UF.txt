It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you know, you know uh um like uh um you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. Um okay um okay um okay um okay um okay um okay um okay um well you know I mean. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to serve so um uh um so like each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's like okay uh okay okay I mean well we're you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know was so you know um well you know so a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because we like like uh well like okay just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make you like uh I mean well so so know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that it's okay like I mean so okay uh just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, you know like I mean um uh you know but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
