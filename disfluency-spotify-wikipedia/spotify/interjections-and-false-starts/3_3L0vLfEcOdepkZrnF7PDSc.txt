Hey y'all. Welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a fucking week late. Okay well well. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to New like okay like Orleans my hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a lot of stuff so like so going on and I could have recorded like the days after but I had so much shit I mean like like like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. Smear I I mean so um have errands to run I was linking with people that I see in a like so well while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New Orleans and uh like uh my mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and it be loud like like um I mean I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my house and no one's here right now, uh um so which is kind of rare. So I'm trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
