You know uh okay so um uh well well. The men the men the men the men the men the men the men the men the men of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery rested their tired bodies along the you know uh you know like well like um uh banks of the Missouri River. It was a welcome respite after a long day like um well uh like um I mean I mean of traveling the sleeping men were so exhausted. They had no idea an intruder you know well so so uh uh you know I mean was in their midst. Under the under the under the under the under the under the under the under the under the cover of Darkness a grizzly bear came into uh you know okay uh uh uh uh I mean Camp lured by bison meat that had been hung up to dry. If it uh you know well so um I mean okay I mean decided it wanted to snack on some humans. There would be no stopping it unaware of uh you know so okay so well I mean well the looming danger the Explorers continue to doze. However, one member of the expedition was alert and awake.
