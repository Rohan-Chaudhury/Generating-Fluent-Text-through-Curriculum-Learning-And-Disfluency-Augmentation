It is Thursday, March 5th 2020 like I mean so uh the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little pregame combo for like well uh okay you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs loss uh okay like um in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row prior The Beat um okay like um Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it yeah, it yeah, it yeah, it yeah, it does but you have to sort of reflect like like uh well on the fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that we're key games like so uh um against teams that were at least on par with them Florida a few points well I mean uh I mean behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver who was okay well like okay battling for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come up against the team um you know you know okay and they play three teams on this west coast swing that are out of it that okay like okay I mean are basically, you know, playing out the string and they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
