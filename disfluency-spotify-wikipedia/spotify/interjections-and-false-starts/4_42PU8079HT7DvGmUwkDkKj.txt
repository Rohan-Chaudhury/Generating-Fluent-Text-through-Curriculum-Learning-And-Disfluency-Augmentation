Good morning, everyone Welcome to our Friday spending time with Jesus podcast today. I I mean you know well um wanted us to look at Romans chapter 1 the entire book of Romans is um like um uh jam-packed with Theology and interesting thoughts and just like amazing Epic. Ders that people quote all like so so uh the time and Romans chapter 1 is really no different and Romans 1 we're so you know um um dealing with our sexuality. We're dealing with idolatry. We're dealing with the question of uh I mean I mean I mean is the law of God really written on the human heart no matter where they're well I mean um well at. No matter where they've grown up or what they've heard all their lives well well I mean well and it's an incredible chapter it lists out all the ways that we can uh you know you know you know act basically in sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that.
