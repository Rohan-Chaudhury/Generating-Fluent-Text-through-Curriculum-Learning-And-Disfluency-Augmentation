It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small range uh I mean you know uh Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. I mean uh like so. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if blood uh um like you know glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, which is so I mean I mean uh the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through the so well um um pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose okay okay so you know if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone so okay um I mean insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of well so like you know insulin these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is so uh like okay insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas um uh like um detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
