Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be okay uh going through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to I mean well be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can you know I mean also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure okay well that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you you know um have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet like okay Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once so once so once you find either uh so you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to I mean well find your navel. So with so with so with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
