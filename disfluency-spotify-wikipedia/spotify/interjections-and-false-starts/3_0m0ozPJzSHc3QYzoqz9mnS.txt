The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls um okay like that were friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking okay like so me how we do it how we get it out there how we record you know uh like it. And you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which I mean like you know if we would have had when we first started out this would have been way I mean you know uh way easier and it's much easier. It is it is it is it is now gotten super easy, you know, uh uh well so anchor is by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you well so you know everything you need. In one in one in one in one place so you don't have to get Pro I mean okay like Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast you know so you know and edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. It's free. So it like well okay gives you all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make it sound I mean um okay good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
