And when you had gone up to you know you know okay you know well be with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter well like um okay um comes to him and he says to him we've been looking for you okay um like so so and Jesus says while I needed to be with the father but also need okay like so so like to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It okay it okay it okay it okay it okay it okay uh I mean like um is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being with God um you know you know uh well the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
