Hello and welcome to come want to start off the show by giving a fond farewell like like you know okay uh like okay at least in the context of a presidential candidate to Amy Klobuchar. Amy Klobuchar has like I mean you know so well so I mean in recent weeks and months on some level endeared herself to me. I mean kind well okay well well well um well of a Madwoman if you're not familiar with her, she wasn't particularly viable as okay so like well I mean okay okay a candidate it seems She got a shot. Someone say surprise. Someone say shocking some would say rat fucking endorsement from The New York Times along.
