Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the okay I mean Gospel reading from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an um um exegesis of the literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter 5 um like verse 43 to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how it was said so like you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say this to you you know okay love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in this way. You well well will be sons of your father in Heaven for he causes his sun like um to rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if you love those.
