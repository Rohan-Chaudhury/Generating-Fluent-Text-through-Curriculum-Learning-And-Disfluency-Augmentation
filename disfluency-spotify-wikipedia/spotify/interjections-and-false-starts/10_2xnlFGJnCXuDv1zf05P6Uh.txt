What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the uh I mean like um uh so uh I mean like okay gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S you know okay I mean okay like like like you know uh like and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from um like I mean uh so well so okay so like a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third you know you know well like so like so so I mean uh row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were you know you know you know okay I mean like so um so uh just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the you know well well I mean okay so okay okay okay I mean model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking like um like so well you know well like well um new tire. Hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and I mean well okay you know like well well um uh well then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these um like well uh well I mean uh uh okay I mean brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome I mean well uh okay I mean uh well um I mean I mean reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, there's um so well you know um I mean okay so I mean um so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all you know you know I mean so uh so um uh um like of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like so so okay well uh um so uh okay well Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what I think well I mean I mean you know okay um um okay um like is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
