A single sardine cannot do much on its own accord. However, it however, it has been you know told I have read that back in the day a massive School of sardines underneath um the Golden Gate Bridge was powerful enough.

If you want to change for better in this industry, um if you want higher prices, if you wish people respected you more as a tile contractor, we have got to band together and unitedly turn this ship around.
