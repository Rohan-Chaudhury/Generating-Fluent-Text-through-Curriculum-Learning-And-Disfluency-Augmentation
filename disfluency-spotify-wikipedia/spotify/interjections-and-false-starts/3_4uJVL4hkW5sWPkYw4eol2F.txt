Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai time major you know like okay Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross rental yields in I mean so I mean Parnell. Now, you might be wondering why are we talking about Parnell given that which is you know um so an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably not likely an investor like uh uh suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a couple of weeks uh okay uh ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks in New you know okay well Zealand and they said can you comment on an article that we're writing for our website so um you know where they were showing by the latest core logic data that the the median gross rental I mean you know you know yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a whereas a whereas a whereas a one-bedroom apartment you know I mean well and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
