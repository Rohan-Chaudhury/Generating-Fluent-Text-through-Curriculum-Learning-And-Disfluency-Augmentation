Welcome to biology for bastards so I mean uh okay I mean teaching biology and the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John like uh uh so I mean Doe D. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter I mean okay you know I mean okay at a time this week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the I mean well so like like Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
