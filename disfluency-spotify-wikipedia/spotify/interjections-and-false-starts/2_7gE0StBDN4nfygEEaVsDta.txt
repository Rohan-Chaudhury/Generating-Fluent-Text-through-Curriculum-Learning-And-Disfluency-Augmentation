Hello and hello and hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised a okay uh bear and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. We are I mean I mean going to take you on a journey blank to the Future and before you um uh and ask where we are going. You don't need green arrows and that's you know well a good thing because you're not going to get them here at least not in um like this episode kind of a topsy-turvy week that saw several Blast from the Past tear up I mean you know the usual FPL narratives and cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s film like so references and of course I'm talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace which Drew so like assisted one. I believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he could be uh uh considered a precursor to America's Alonso. And of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before but before but before we get into this any.
