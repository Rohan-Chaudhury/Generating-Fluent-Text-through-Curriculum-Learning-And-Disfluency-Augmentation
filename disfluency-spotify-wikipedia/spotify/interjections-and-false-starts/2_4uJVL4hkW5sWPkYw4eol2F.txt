We're going we're going we're going to be talking about gross uh uh rental yields in Parnell. Now, you now, you now, you might be wondering why are we talking about like um Parnell given that which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is like I mean probably not likely an investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well uh like a couple of weeks ago. I got I got I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large I mean like banks in New Zealand and they said can you comment on an article that we're okay uh writing for our website where they were showing by the latest core logic data like okay that the the median gross rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell okay uh is 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that you know well is 5.1% and they said it can you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
