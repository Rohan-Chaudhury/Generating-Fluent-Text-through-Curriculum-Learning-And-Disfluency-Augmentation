The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were like so friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we well I mean do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you know, thankfully like I mean I was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have had okay well when we first started out this would have been way way easier and it's much easier. It I it I it I mean like is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far the easiest way to well so make a podcast it gives you everything you need. In one place so you okay you know don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything and you can so so literally make a podcast and edit it on your phone right there free. It's free. Um uh. It's free. So it gives you all the creation tools. You need to edit it to make I mean well it sound good which you know, if we didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
