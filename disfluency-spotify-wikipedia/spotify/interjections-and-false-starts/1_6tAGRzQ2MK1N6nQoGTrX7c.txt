Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through um a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying you know down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can also like do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure so that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if so you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your so feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you like find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you uh to find your navel. So with so with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
