What's up, everybody Anton craley here from e-commerce lifestyle.com and welcome back I mean to the podcast. So a big question that I get either via email um or over on our YouTube channel is from people that are just getting started with I mean their online store and they want to know what they actually have to get you know done prior to launch. So kind of the technicality is right and this is okay outside of how to pick a niche how to get suppliers how to get traffic like all that stuff. You can learn more about on my free training over at Dropship okay webinar.com. I'll post a link to that in the the description by the way Dropship okay webinar.com, but once you know all that stuff and you kind of understand how you know to build the business then the question is, well, what do you actually have to um get done before you make that website on Shopify before you contact your like first supplier before you get your first sale? So I so I want to cover a uh business checklist in this podcast go over a couple different options you have and then um let you know what I do and what I recommend so with that being like said, let's go ahead and get into today's episode. Okay. So the first thing we should talk about.
