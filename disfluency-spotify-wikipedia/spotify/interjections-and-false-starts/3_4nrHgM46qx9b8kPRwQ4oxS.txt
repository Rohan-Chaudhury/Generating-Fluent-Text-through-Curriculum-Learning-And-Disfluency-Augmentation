Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place suddenly so okay I mean a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the um well so whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be okay I mean um tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of I mean I mean um them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began. To speak to speak to speak to speak in other tongues uh um so as the spirit enabled them. Now there was staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment.
