So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And well I mean okay you know uh you know I mean okay like well yes, I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my well uh I mean like okay I mean you know like um uh coach because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about like um well I mean uh like like like well you know parenting and how hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed so okay I mean okay uh so okay I mean um okay myself to fall into this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean so like um like you know uh okay uh I mean. A way, which I know better than to do but I just kind of got caught you know uh uh so well you know you know I mean you know uh in a loop and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something so well okay um um uh um you know okay so to me so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has I mean okay uh okay you know well like um you know like been so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
