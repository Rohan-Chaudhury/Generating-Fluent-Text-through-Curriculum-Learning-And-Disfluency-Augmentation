Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If you uh follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know that um I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of okay God. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be I mean looking at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll okay be using and speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. Okay. My heart my heart behind this is that as we go through tests and trials which we so can't obviously avoid but we will our mindset that we would go through it will well be different. I am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
