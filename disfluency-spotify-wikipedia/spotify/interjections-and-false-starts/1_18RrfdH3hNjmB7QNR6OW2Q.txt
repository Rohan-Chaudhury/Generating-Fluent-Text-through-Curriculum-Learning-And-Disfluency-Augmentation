Hello and welcome back to the not another Runner podcast. Thank you so much for like joining today. I am I am so thankful that you have downloaded this episode and that you choose I mean to listen today. I've had an awful cold all week. So hopefully I'll be able uh to get through this introduction without losing my voice. So today's episode is well something I couldn't wait to publish. The guest today is a fellow Irishman the uh very first wash guest of a podcast. And someone I have followed on social media well for a long while now. I'd actually heard of this guest back on okay another podcast God over a year ago. Now whilst I was training for the well London marathon and I remember listening thinking wow, this guy is crazy like what he you know has achieved. I was I was just bewildered by his achievements. He is an ultra runner from penarth Cardiff South Wales. His name is Reese Jenkins. He.
