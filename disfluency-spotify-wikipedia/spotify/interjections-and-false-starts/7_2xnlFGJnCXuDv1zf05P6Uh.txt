What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about well okay you know uh I mean I mean you know the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S you know well you know you know uh I mean okay and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited like I mean uh well um um like about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to like so okay well well um I mean the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just well you know well well well okay well recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. Well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well um um so so I mean. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new I mean like like um so uh uh tire. Hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay so you know like you know uh so like five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads uh so like so well like I mean which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some well I mean you know so I mean you know you know awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking I mean like I mean well uh like so like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand uh so I mean um like well you know to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard okay so okay so well I mean uh fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, I mean okay okay like um well well but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
