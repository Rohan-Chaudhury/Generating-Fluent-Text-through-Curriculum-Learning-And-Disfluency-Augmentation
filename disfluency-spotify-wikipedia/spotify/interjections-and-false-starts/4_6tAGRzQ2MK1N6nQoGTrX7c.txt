Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going well like you know you know through a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down well well uh you know on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can also do this in well you know you know uh a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure that your like well okay well back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you have your legs okay uh I mean I mean crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your feet Flat on the ground like okay you know uh ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either you're sitting or you're uh so uh uh laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. So with uh you know you know so your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
