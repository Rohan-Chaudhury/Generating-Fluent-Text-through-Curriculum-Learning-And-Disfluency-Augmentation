Hi, I'm hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the uh topic of today's video is going to be going with the flow and I got an email so here from a client of mine that I've been coaching for is probably since late uh last year by eight eight nine months. I guess. I've been coaching him now. Well maybe well maybe um longer so he sent me this email and he's got a couple um of situations that he's asking me about so he basically he meets his All at um a concert and I guess his group and her group of friends kind okay of emerged at some point, and she listened this. She says that she well told him to text her later and then he says, but I just told her if she wanted to meet up.
