He'll and he'll and welcome to a Satanist treats to Bible exploring the Bible Christianity and okay other religions and their sacred texts through the lens of Satanism and order to reinvent well religion for myself. Okay story time. I was I was driving to visit a friend okay while listening to to the excellent album hearts of No Light by shamash, which I highly well recommend for fans of Behemoth in particular and blew out one of the speakers in you know my car. My current workload prevents me from getting it replaced. So instead of well Music I've had to listen to stuff that is still enjoyable when it's only coming okay out of one of the two stereo channels so podcasts because I'm not well the only satanic or philosophical podcast on the Block and it's probably well past time that.
