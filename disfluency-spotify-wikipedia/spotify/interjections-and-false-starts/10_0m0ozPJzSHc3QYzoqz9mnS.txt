I mean um uh I mean uh well so you know so okay. And you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you know, thankfully I was able to tell them about anchor which if we well you know uh um you know so well like you know okay would have had when we first started out this would have been way way like I mean um like okay um well um uh like easier and it's much easier. It is now gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is I mean um okay um I mean so uh okay you know like by far the easiest way to make a podcast it gives you everything okay okay like um like okay uh okay you know well you need. In one place so you don't have to get Pro Tools or any you know you know um like like you know uh I mean okay like fancy recording equipment or anything and you can literally make a podcast you know like um so I mean you know I mean um you know um and edit it on your phone right there free.
