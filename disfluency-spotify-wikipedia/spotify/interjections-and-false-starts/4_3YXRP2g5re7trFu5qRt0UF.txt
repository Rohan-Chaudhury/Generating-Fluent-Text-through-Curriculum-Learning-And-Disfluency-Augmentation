It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you know, um I mean um okay you done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. I mean okay so uh. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here um um like uh to serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. Well like so like. So it's like we're you can't even enjoy the success when you okay okay like so ask that question, you know was a success not enough to sustain so uh okay you know it. I don't think it was enough because we just weren't having fun. When we um you know um so weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways to make you know, a lot of us joke so so well um the Twitter can be totally useless that it's just a bunch of idiots run I mean like I mean I mean wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
