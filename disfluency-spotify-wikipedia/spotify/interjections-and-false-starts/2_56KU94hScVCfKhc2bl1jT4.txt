Hi everyone. Thanks again for tuning into the logical Bible study podcast. I really well I mean appreciate your support. I hope you're getting a lot out of studying the Bible in you know well this way by looking at the literal sense of the text, which is something we uh um don't often talk about enough, but we need to we need to talk about well okay it more and today we're looking at. And really interesting passage. It's quite unlike everything else. Like uh. We see in the gospels really so Matthew 17 1 to 9, which you know well is the Transfiguration. Jesus Took with him Peter and James and his brother I mean well John and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone. There like so in their presence he was transfigured his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
