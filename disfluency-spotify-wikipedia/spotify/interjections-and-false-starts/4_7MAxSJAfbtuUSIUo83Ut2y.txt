As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and a half. Okay uh you know uh. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it um I mean I mean you know was a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through um you know well well the roof. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which okay um um you know was probably a fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not you know so um I mean our number one problem and really it was just bingo. So anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody could win you know okay I mean you know and there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess you could say I'm not too um so like so sure what is safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve you know like like okay that but also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was getting I mean well well uh Aids on the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth uh uh so you know state funded money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
