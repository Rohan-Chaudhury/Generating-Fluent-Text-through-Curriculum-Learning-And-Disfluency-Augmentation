Hey exercise hey exercise confidence listeners today. I am sitting down with Bree Guillory Bree and I became good you know friends when we were taking an anatomy lab at Cal State Long Beach Bree was actually well taken the course because she was preparing to apply to occupational therapy school. Okay. She has recently been admitted and we are so proud of her Bree also has so a background in kinesiology, which is what she studied for her undergraduate major and when okay she was still studying that she also played basketball NCAA Division II at Cal State so East Bay. So this woman has a lot of knowledge about not only how uh to exercise but also how to exercise confidence. We're going to dive into some like of the ways in which she's faced some really tough situations and she's had to so pull out that inner strength to keep going in the face of some situations where you know she did not think she can make it through. I'm really excited for you to hear her story and I apologize.
