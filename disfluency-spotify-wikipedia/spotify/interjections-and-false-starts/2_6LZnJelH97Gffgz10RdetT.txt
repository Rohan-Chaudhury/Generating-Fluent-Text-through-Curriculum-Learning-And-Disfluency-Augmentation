Hello, everyone. Dr. Davidson Edmund. I hope everybody's doing very well and staying healthy. I mean okay. Today we're going to talk about their coronavirus. But first of all, I'd so so like to introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm a board certified well like Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see you about 40 50 okay um patients a day and the office I'll still go to the hospital and usually I mean okay have a census. It's been 5 to 15 patients, including ICU and critical heal okay I mean patients. So literally my patients have been very worried about the core virus and to well well be honest who is not been worried about this. Okay? And therefore I've had multiple questions regarding, you know, what what what they can do to protect.
