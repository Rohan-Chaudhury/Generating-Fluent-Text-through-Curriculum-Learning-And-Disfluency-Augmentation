Hi and welcome to worldwide with kbdb with your host me to me. If like uh okay uh I mean you know you follow me on Instagram at knowing better doing better. Then you will know uh so you know okay um like that I post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of uh you know uh like you know uh God. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be looking you know you know I mean um you know I mean at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be using and okay I mean okay you know um um speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those challenges. My heart uh like I mean um well uh behind this is that as we go through tests and trials which we can't obviously like um um so uh so avoid but we will our mindset that we would go through it will be different. So you know um so so well. I am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to apply the okay uh so um I mean like word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
