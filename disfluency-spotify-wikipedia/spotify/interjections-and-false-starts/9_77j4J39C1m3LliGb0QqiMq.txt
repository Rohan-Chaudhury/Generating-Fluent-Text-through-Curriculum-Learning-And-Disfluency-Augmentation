The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel okay well well okay okay like like um uh Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included okay okay okay like okay like like you know okay her reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled um so uh um well so so uh like Tastefully but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on okay like you know well I mean you know like so you know Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its so well uh okay uh I mean I mean you know like cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user like uh well uh uh okay well okay well and ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for okay like okay you know uh you know okay um uh bullying and the show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The so you know um so you know like you know so I mean Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments.

The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You like so uh uh like well you know so so can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season there well well uh well like um like uh I mean will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then uh well so well you know um well so well confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
