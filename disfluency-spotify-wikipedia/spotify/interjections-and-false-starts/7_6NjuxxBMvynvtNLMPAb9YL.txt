So okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay so okay well um I mean well uh. Like when like when like when like when like when like when like when like when I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry well so well okay well you know I mean when I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many like uh um okay like so well times as possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken I mean well I mean like well you know okay all the work out. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop I mean okay okay so well so well up or lyrics or stand out all these musical landmarks will come up and I mean you know um okay like okay well you don't know what that's going to be or when it will be but like so well like I mean so well it just happens after you listen to it for a while and then okay uh I mean um uh like you know when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when I mean I mean so so well uh like those two things come together and you teach your already naturally in the music.
