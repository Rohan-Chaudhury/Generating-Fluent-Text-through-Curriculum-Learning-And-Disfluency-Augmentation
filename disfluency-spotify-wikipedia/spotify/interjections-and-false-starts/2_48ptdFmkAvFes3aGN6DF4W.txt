Good morning, my fellow Christian Brethren. My name my name my name is Michael and I will be so well your host for our daily devotional a time for us to rethink refocus uh like and to renew the title for today's devotional is loud and passionate. And okay um the memory verse is taken from John 7 verse 37. And it says on okay okay the last and greatest day of the festival Jesus stood and said in a loud okay like voice let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink when we view so like the invitation to come to Jesus Through the lens of the Greek text. It is passionately expressive just as we have in our memory text John 7 verse 37.
