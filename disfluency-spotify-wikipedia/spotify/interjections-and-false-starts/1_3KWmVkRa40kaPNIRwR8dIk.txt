Hi, welcome hi, welcome to you were taught that in school episode 1 taxes, everyone always writes uh after they get out of school about how they couldn't do their taxes like and how they wish school and taught them to do their taxes. And why and why didn't like somebody teach them do their taxes what you were taught that in school. Like. It's called basic math in first grade or 2nd grade. They taught you how to um add and subtract numbers. That's how you do taxes. You line you line them okay up in a column you add some together, you subtract some the Part about that um is you were taught how to follow directions. There's directions at the top of okay the paper. You were supposed to read them. You read those directions and you well follow them. So you were taught that in school that was in elementary school uh the fact that you can't follow directions and do simple math doesn't mean that so you weren't taught that in school. It just means that you can't do simple math uh or follow directions. This has been you we're taught that in school episode 1. See you next week.
