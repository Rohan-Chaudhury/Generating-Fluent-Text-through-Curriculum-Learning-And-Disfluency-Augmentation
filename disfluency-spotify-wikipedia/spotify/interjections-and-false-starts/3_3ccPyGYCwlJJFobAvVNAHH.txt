Hello, welcome to the theology pug cast and we're glad to have you with I mean I mean uh us again. And it's the whole crew here today and we're going to do well I mean well this ourselves in a minute, but guys, I realized just the other day well I mean you know that we've been at this for a year. Well, I think this is like I mean well like episode 56 or something. Maybe it maybe that's wrong. We need the fact Checkers out there you know okay um to correct us, you know, occasionally we do say things that are not correct often speak for so well I mean yourself. Awesome, we correct each other in the course of the show, but that just uh like okay has because we do is almost zero prep. We just kind of come so like okay from wherever we are and we sit down and and I think most of the like well I mean time we do catch each other but Caitlin someone Catches Us from someplace well so I mean else. Never glad. I'm glad that I don't think it's ever happened to Glenn. I'm okay well like glad you got me last week on Warfield and Whitfield. I've not heard the end of it my colleague Frank a mullet.
