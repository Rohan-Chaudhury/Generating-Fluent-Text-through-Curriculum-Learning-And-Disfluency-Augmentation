I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about well okay you know like uh the woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about um so you know you know so the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they take it I mean I mean okay uh um where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two hours wasn't quite well like um well so enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer time and well um I mean you know so North American summer time do not occur at the same time.
