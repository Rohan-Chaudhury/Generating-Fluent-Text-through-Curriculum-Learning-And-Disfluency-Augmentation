What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford in London, so Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is it is Thursday, March 5th okay 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little pregame combo for you michael. Um. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs loss in San Jose. But um hey, that's okay. They had won three in a row prior The Beat Goes On good like morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you have to sort of reflect on the you know fact that the Leafs won three games in. Road that we're key games against okay teams that were at least on par with them Florida a few points behind them Tampa like Bay ahead of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver who was battling for like a playoff spot in the Western Conference. They come up against the team and like they play three teams on this west coast swing that are out of it that are I mean basically, you know, playing out the string and they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
