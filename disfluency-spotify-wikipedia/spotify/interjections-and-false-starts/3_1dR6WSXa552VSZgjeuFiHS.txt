Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited well well um about talking to you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom okay like you know expansion assets. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not uh um um just about how much money you have in your bank account. It's about well you know okay establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and well uh like all that good stuff. I get so many questions from people as I travel the you know uh um world helping. Some VIP. So this is our time for us to be together and you know like well for me to answer your questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have well okay well been in a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's um uh um actually more vocal about it than I am but it's a little frustrating when well you know uh I see others getting married and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely okay well I mean happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray.
