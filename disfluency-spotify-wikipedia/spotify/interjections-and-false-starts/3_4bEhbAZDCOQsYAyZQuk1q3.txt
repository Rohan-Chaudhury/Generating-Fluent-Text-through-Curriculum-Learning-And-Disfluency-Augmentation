Hello Madge fans and welcome to Mage the podcast the podcast that works um like I mean hard towards Ascension. So you so you so you so you don't have to I'm your host Adam Simpson and um um so I am joined by terrie Robinson. And today we are going to talk about the okay so I mean dream speakers in another episode of tomes of magic. But before but before but before but before we do, I thought you know well you know it might be nice to cover some announcements and also Terry how you doing. I am doing I mean I mean like fine. I was on the Midnight Express podcast to talk about the well I mean you know woo Kang now we talked for almost two and a A half hours just about okay um like the Wu-Tang because B ches discussion of the Hem Caso back where they okay I mean well take it where he takes 18 pages of material and talks about that for two well um okay hours wasn't quite enough but the key mistake I made was I forgot that Australian summer so like so time and North American summer time do not occur at the same time. So I mean you know like I'm like, let's figure out a time to record what will be good and I'm like 9:00 well like well p.m. Your time your time your time your time sounds good and I work backwards and like I can so well well wake up at that point you're in this portion is bloody. But and then only later did I find out that.
