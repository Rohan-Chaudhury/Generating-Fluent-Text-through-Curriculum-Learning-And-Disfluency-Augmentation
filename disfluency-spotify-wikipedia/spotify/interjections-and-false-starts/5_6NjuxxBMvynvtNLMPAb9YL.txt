Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a okay well uh you know like release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I you know um I mean I mean um forget the choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just you know so you know so well listened to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when I'm okay like um well so in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when I'm I mean okay okay I mean I mean training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as possible, uh so you know like uh but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. Like so well I mean okay. It's just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand out all um um um you know okay these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what that's going to so so well you know uh be or when it will be but it just happens after you listen to it okay I mean like so you know for a while and then when you actually then go right let's plug in and learn so uh so so okay the choreography when those two things come together and you teach your already I mean well okay you know like naturally in the music. So those so those so those so those so those so those little moments that your son or little hit movement like well I mean okay well or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
