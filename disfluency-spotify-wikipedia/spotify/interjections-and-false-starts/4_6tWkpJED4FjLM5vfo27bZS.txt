The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel like I mean you know well Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her I mean like uh you know reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled you know okay like uh Tastefully but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on well uh okay you know Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have its cake I mean um you know uh and eat it too with one trending post led by user and ingenious username saying you know I mean I mean like how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying and the so like uh um show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor show like I mean well you know Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The okay okay you know okay show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You well so okay so can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season you know uh like uh there will be multiple villains. Another user another user another user another user another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then well um um um confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
