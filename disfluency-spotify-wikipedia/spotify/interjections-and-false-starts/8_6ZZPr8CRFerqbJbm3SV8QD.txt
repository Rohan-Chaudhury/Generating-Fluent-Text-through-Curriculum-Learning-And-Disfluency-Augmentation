Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting like you know like you know so I mean so okay as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. I mean like so like uh um like you know. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm I mean so I mean like you know um uh okay and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of so well you know uh like I mean you know well making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the I mean so I mean um like like okay so Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high you know well okay I mean um um like I mean higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
