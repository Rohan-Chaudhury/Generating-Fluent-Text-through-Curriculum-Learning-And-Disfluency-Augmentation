Usually I wait to reflect on my guest and work on the introduction for Saturday so well mornings. There's no there's no there's no sleeping in my house because we have a puppy and he likes um well to get up really early. But today's a little bit different. I keep thinking about you know you know our guest. Mrs. Whitman's story. I know her story is going to resonate with um um so many of you out there. I want you to listen. This one all the you know like way through. If you don't know. Mrs. Whitman, you're going to know her pretty well well okay at the end of this half hour episode this half hour goes by fast. Now. I mean I mean. I know this sounds like a Shameless plug but it isn't please share the episode okay okay people need to hear her story. They need they need they need to hear about her resiliency. They need like I mean to hear about how she weather's so many different storms that have taken place so well in her life. Thanks for listening. Please let me know what you think write a review.
