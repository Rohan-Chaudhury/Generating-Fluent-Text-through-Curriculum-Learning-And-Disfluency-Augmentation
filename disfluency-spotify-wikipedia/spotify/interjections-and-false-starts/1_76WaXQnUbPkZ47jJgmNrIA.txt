Hi everyone, welcome back to our podcast and we're taking a look at the Gospel like reading from today's mass and then we're going to try and provide an exegesis of the um literal sense of the text. So today's reading is from Matthew chapter 5 verse 43 uh to 48. Jesus said to his disciples. You have learned how it was said well you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say this to so you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in this way. Well. You will be sons of your father in Heaven for he causes his sun I mean to rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike. For if for if you love those.
