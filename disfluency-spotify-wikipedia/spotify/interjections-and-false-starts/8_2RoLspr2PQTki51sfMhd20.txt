In the year leading up to the 2020 election. We're counting down the biggest scandals so I mean um so well uh well uh in American political history. This is number 36 Carol Hubbard Junior. The former Congressman well you know so um you know I mean okay uh was charged with three felonies after illegally using his campaign fund and Congressional staff so I mean um so well uh um like for personal use 56 year old former Congressman Carol Hubbard Junior thought he was getting ready to uh you know um you know you know um uh uh participate in a sting mission for the FBI the past few years on um okay uh so okay like like like the hill had been tough for him pesky Agents from the bureau had been poking you know uh uh so well so well well around his Finance records. They were definitely looking for something no matter Hubbard thought he'd well well I mean uh well you know well okay outrun his cooked books with a little quid pro quo. He could play nice like well you know well well um so I mean for a couple months and help the FBI. Investigate lobbying in Libya, then they'd see he was worth his salt.
