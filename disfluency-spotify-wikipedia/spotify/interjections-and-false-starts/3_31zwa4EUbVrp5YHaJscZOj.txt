So I well uh okay made a post the other day about the you know, I even made a podcast uh so I mean it was probably one or two podcast back now from here maybe but about you know, okay uh you know your gym not being the best our today, you know, I think it so uh you know should be more of a pillar of the schedule and I made this like you know well Instagram post and I dropped it in a couple of Philly at owners groups. And um so so anyway, obviously you can imagine the feedback was was was mixed and one well um um individual this Rob he owns a gym. I believe it's called CrossFit rise again. I uh so I mean apologize Rob if I'm fucking that up. You know, he shot me a DM and you know so I mean you just like bro. I don't I don't agree. I think this argument is so so like pointless. I don't get it. You should you should you should you should strive to do both like and he well okay you know just didn't agree with it which was but he reached out to me and show okay uh uh me a DM and I do what I typically do when I hit him with an well okay um audio message and explain my position and you know next thing, you know, so you know you know we're back and forth with a few audio messages and the guy, you you know okay so know, we're we went from adversarial to you know, I probably go get a beer the.
