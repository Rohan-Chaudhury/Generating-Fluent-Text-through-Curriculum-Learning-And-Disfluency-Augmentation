It doesn't make me afraid I did not injure myself. So there is no well you know need to worry or I don't need to worry that there's damage. And anyway, this is I mean uh just what I'm feeling and I know it'll pass at some point and movement well you know really seems to make all the difference which I think is so cool. Hello, you know uh everybody today. We are we are we are joined by Jenna and she's one of my clients and she's actually so okay turned into a quite a dear friend of mine during our time together. And um like so today we are going to be having a conversation about her journey that okay well led up to her and I working together where she's at. Now what she likes so well about our time together things that you can't stand also perhaps we'll see where it goes. But the goal of today is to highlight her journey in the hopes of connecting.
