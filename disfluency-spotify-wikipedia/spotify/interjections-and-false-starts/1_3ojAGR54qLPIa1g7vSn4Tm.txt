So not the like Bowman Prospect cards the ones with the RC logo. So I was putting like together some statistics with the PSA Pop reports and then the pricing of those specific okay cards, so Here's basically what I got, so like I was looking at like players basically well I use trout as a baseline, but I think something that's when I originally made this.
