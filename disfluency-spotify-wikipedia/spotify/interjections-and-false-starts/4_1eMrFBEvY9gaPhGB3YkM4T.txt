I was very I mean you know okay I mean traumatized after seeing a man turn into some messed up organism right in front of you know okay so so my eyes. I just sat in my booth we reading the rules again. Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay like okay. And again, it was so dark in here that I had to use the um so like well small lamp on the table next to me. They really need to fix the lights here. Like you know um so. Yeah, I yeah, I yeah, I yeah, I yeah, I also realized I had broken the first rule. Hopefully other than traumatizing me. I mean like so um. It didn't do much damage. This is going to be a great shift. The first the first the first the first the first thing uh uh I mean I mean I tried was to walk out but I could see movement in my peripheral vision. Okay okay like so. They got closer as I moved towards the exit the shadows in the station elongated towards me and I got a horrible gut.
