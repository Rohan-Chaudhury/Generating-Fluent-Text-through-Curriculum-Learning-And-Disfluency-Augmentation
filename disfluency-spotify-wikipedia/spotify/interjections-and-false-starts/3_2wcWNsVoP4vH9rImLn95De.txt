So the other night I was getting some support from a coach. And yes, I mean you know okay I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because like I mean I mean I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how uh you know you know hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this you know I mean um pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I uh um like know better than to do but I just kind of got caught in a loop so okay well and it's one of my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me I mean so like so very profound and the shift that it has created since then has been okay okay you know so powerful that he just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is keeping your eye.
