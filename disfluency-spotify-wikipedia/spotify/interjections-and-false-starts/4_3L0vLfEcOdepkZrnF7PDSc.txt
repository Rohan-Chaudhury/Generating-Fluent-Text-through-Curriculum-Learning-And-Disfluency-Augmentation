Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New Orleans you know okay you know I mean and my mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and okay I mean you know like it be loud like I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my house and no well well okay you know one's here right now, which is kind of rare.
