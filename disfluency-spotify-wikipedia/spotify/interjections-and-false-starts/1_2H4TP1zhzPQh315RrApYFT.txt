You are you are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. I'm going to uh be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's see here okay probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to believe like that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of um that kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. So. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted well in a while, but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent the like last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I like met her and she has spent all these years doing that. So she's going um to share some of her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good like discussion. I have I have to apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I like need to do before I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on.
