Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, okay uh like there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the kids so okay um do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in this household and well I mean okay this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a couch not well um so walk on it not run on it now jump on it and dance on okay well I mean it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for sitting that's it. So when you I mean uh uh catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed to but they you know um well just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, but like like uh when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking stop walking stop walking stop walking on the couch stop.
