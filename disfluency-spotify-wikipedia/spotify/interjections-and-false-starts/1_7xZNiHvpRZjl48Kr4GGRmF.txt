Hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with uh Erica and Shay. I have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about um before we talk about like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were well reading the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question my question is no spoilers. We don't we don't um have to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally I mean recommend it Shea tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John I mean Mayer after reading Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be I mean under a rock right now. I even I even went to his Instagram account. I don't follow you know him just to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I I I I mean went down when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went I went uh to his Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
