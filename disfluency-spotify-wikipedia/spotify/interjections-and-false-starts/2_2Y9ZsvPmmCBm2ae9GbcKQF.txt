Hey everyone. How's it going? It's been a while. I miss you guys. Hope well um you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this um like episode starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the title of this podcast um um is called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. Um you know. I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, so um you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then but then but then as I like you know recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the well uh theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the well well things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up uh okay and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So uh okay with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I I mean uh finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up you know well is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them like um share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
