Preserve Me O God for in the do so um I put my trust I have said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord. I um well have no good be on thee as for the saints that are in the earth. Like well. They are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight their well I mean sorrows shall be multiplied that exchange the Lord for another God their you know um drink offerings of blood. I will not offer nor take their names upon my lips. Well um. The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup Dow maintains like like my lat the Lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places. Yea, I have uh I mean a goodly Heritage. I Will Bless The Lord who has given me counsel. Yay. My reins instruct me in the night Seasons. I have set the lord.
