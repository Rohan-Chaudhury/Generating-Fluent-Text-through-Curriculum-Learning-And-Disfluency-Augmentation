together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how okay uh uh so you know well like well Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets okay uh okay you know um like well so up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to I mean well uh um well okay so um be with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up well um um like okay uh well okay to be with the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon um like okay I mean well um uh well Peter comes to him and he says to him we've been looking for you you know well well um like well well I mean and Jesus says while I needed to be with the father but also need well so you know uh so I mean well you know to go somewhere else. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. Uh okay I mean I mean um so uh okay. It is the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins he begins he begins he begins he begins he begins he begins he begins he begins it by being so so you know um okay okay okay uh with God the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
