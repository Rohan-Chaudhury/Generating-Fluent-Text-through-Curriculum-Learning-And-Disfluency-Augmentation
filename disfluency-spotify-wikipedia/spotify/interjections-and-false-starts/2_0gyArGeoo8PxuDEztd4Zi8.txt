Hello, my name is Kate Coker. And this is your everyday positivity on well like Vale. I was scrolling through Facebook the other day and someone suggested a Stevie Wonder so you know song as the best song on the planet. Can you can you can you beat it? And all it did well so for me was remind me of the greatest TV Wonder song for me of all time, I mean so which is called Love's in Need of Love Today. I mean, I mean, I mean, first of all when you I mean uh come up with a song lyric like that, you've got to go. Um, man, so so I've nailed life love is in need of Love Today and He's my favorite like I mean Stevie Wonder song and I love sitting and listening to it the message on uh like it. Is that Love's in Need of Love today? We need we need we need to give the love um okay back to ourselves to for loved it. It's that cycle and I wanted to get I mean well you to consider that you can apply this to lots of things in your life I mean you know and fundamentally you are in need of you today. So put so put so put some time aside today to really do something that brings you Joy.
