I reported like okay uh so that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in I mean uh like you know the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie okay uh well like was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that well that well that well that well that theory is officially dead because uh I mean okay you know Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get like so I mean so this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not like okay like you know the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there so well so like any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But um I mean well well as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Um I mean uh well. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all that's all that's all that's all that's all I've got I mean you know well you know for today on Bachelor News Daily.
