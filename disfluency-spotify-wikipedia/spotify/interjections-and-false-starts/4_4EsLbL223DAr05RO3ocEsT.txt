His first child was about to be born as so like like I mean he rushed past the Windows. He heard the crack of thunder and a deluge of rain you know um like well spattering against the glass. He stopped in his tracks the weather reminding him of um well I mean I mean a prophecy. He'd heard years before if you do. Do this evil thing you shall I mean I mean I mean I mean have an evil son your nation shall become prey to Terrors and tears rivers of like you know well like blood will flow. The heads of the mighty will fall your cities will be devoured well uh I mean you know by Flames. He shook he shook he shook he shook he shook his head. He couldn't think about those words now his sin well uh uh uh had already been committed now, he must be beside his wife in greet his child in the midst of the Wind and Rain.
