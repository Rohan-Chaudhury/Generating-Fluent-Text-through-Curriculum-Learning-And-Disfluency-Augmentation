Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be um um you know well explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become okay I mean I mean like more masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such I mean like um you know an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control like um okay um their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of okay I mean okay uh what they would like and as a man this is important to your I mean well uh uh success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want you know okay so you know to become a man of value so that way other men or other people in general so okay um okay can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the you know so I mean I mean deal. If you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a you know uh so uh person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, well I mean uh you know you're not going to do very well. Okay, because this video might like I mean you know okay take me a little bit to explain so grab a pen grab a um I mean so well paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
