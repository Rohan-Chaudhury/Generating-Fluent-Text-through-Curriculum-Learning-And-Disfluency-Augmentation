So is he do so um you know you know um you know well you know you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, uh well uh um so um so you know it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had uh okay okay like like okay okay you know girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn so um um uh I mean um um I mean especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where I so okay uh well like so you know okay meant to be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. So so um I mean I mean um I mean uh um I do need to have ways of getting around that which may involve you know so um so um you know I mean um meeting up with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
