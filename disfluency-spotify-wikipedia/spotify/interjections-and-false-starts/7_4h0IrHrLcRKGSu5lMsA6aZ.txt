extraordinary women the podcast presenting extraordinary stories by ordinary women from Munich So I'm um um you know so um I mean I mean procedure right? I am South African and I've been living in Munich for well uh uh so like like uh almost seven and a half years and I'm currently an energy therapist well so you know so you know uh you know but most of my focus goes into a trauma Survivor community that I started just uh like so okay uh well well over a year ago. It was really interesting because I grew up under the time you know I mean well I mean uh um um of Apartheid. And so I grew up thinking that how I lived was normal. I remember I mean you know okay so I mean like okay hearing Nelson Mandela's name for the first time when I was 9 years old.
