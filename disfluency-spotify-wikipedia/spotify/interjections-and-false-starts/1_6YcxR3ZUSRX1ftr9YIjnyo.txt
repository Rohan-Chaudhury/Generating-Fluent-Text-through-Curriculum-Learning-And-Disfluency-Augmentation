Appreciate you coming on like you've got an amazing story and I love for you to share it with a well lot of people. Yeah, thank you. I'm so I'm so excited that you're doing this. I think um it's somewhat long overdue and you know, I love listening so far and I can't wait uh to continue to follow along in the future. Yeah. I mean I've told you um many times we have such great conversations and we talk in depth about how so you got to where you are and what drives you and what motivates you and like all those sorts of things.
