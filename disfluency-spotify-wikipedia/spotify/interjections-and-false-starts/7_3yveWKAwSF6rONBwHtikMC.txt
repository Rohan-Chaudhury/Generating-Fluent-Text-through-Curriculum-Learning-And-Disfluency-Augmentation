Hi, I'm be and you're listening to the bubble. And today I'm interviewing had so like so okay so you know like girl Izzie Wilson about time management and how she does it. So is he well um I mean uh well um well do you find it hard to balance time between all the stuff you so I mean um you know you know um uh do? Yes, it's very tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought so so well well like I mean uh everything else had girl duties, but it's such an essential skill. That you that you that you that you that you that you that you that you so you know okay okay uh so so have to learn especially when doing gcses and a-levels. So I have some days where so okay so okay uh you know well I meant to be in three meetings at once which can be quite challenging. Like uh okay um okay you know you know. So I so I so I so I so I so I so I so I do need to have ways of getting around that which may involve meeting up like I mean like I mean you know I mean I mean with whoever is chairing the meeting before and afterwards to find out what's discussed and but for my a-levels.
