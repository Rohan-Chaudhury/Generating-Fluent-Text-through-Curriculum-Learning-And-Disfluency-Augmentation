Hope um hope um hope um hope um hope um hope um you know you know I mean uh you guys are all having a lovely lovely week so far now before this episode well okay uh um okay starts. I just want to give a quick announcement. So the so the so the so the so the so the title of this podcast is I mean so um um I mean called catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought you like um uh okay okay know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know catch so uh like well okay up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded the past few episodes, okay um I mean so so I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme of this podcast okay I mean so I mean so should be. So if you know notice a lot of the things that we I mean so um you know uh covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and things we deal so okay you know okay like with as a teenager or as a young adult. So with that said the okay um I mean I mean so new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I finally figure out what the I mean uh uh uh I mean theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up is going to be you know like so well so having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them share what they think is um uh well okay well important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
