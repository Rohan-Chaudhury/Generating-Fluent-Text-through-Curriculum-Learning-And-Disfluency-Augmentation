At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a Southern uh okay uh um state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six feet deep outside I mean you know like uh and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof like uh um well watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw Hat you know I mean okay um as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who lost that hat um okay you know I mean is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around the around the around the around the around the like so okay like corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to his okay uh so you know surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very strange. Um so okay you know. So the so the so the so the so the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of you know okay like uh the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came back Upstream I mean so I mean so yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
