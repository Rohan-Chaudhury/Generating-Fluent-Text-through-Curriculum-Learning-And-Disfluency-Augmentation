Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this and this and this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic well I mean of today's newsletter is going to be struggling with my purpose in life. This is this is this is something like okay that I think pretty much every man struggles with because the reality is you're you know you know not going to stay positive all the time. You're not always going to feel like things okay you know are going to work out in your favor. You're not always going to feel like um you know you're doing the right thing someday is going to be really great and you're going you know you know to be full of passion and feel inspired. And other days it's going to okay you know feel hopeless and like things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous okay you know hopeless dreamer, especially if you got people chirping in your ear and your life telling you okay uh what a stupid idea that you've embarked on or that business you want to well you know build or that career you want to have is just unrealistic for you. So I've got so so an email here from a guy who knows what he wants. He's figured out what his purpose is, but he has plenty of.
