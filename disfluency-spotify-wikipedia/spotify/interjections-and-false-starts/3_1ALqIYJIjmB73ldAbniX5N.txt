This is Holy Family School of faith. Welcome to our Rosary meditation, let's begin okay okay well in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Uh you know uh. Amen. It's called a mind all those who promise to pray for Hope is um uh I mean the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal well like like life as our happiness placing all our trust in Christ promises and relying like like I mean not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit, like well okay So with hope we strive for Holiness we strive to become a saint as something like so you know which is possible but not yet guaranteed. And there are three conditions needed for the so you know uh virtue of Hope first and active pursuit of God Holiness in heaven second, the realization that the attainment of Holiness in heaven is possible.
