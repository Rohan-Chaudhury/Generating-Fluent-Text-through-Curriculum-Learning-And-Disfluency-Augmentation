Now the way we're defining flipping for the conversation today you know um is just the selling of any shaving related item that's significantly marked up from the well I mean original price. We hope you enjoy the conversation and now onto the episode. Hot cake hot cake hot cake you know so flipping okay, if you can sell a Wolfman for $2,000 all the power to you.
