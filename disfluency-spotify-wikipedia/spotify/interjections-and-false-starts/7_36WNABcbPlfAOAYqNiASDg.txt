If you're interested in learning more about raising your vibration, check out our uh well like so um uh okay show notes in a hotel room me they always have those Bibles and and I opened I mean okay like you know so I mean like it. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you saying you know I mean well so um okay um all is well. They're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from they're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of have that uh um okay I mean I mean uh okay habit of of of telling us all is well and your own words. And so and so and so and so and so and so and so and so I mean um okay uh like I mean okay okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels uh you know um uh so I mean like and we want to remind you that that there is a stream of well you know you know like well you know um well-being which you are allowing or not. And what we've noticed about any who I mean like uh uh you know I mean okay for whatever reason are standing in a place where they are not allowing uh I mean you know like like um uh their alignment with that stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being you know um um like well so okay that is so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always that's always that's always that's always that's always that's always that's always that's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
