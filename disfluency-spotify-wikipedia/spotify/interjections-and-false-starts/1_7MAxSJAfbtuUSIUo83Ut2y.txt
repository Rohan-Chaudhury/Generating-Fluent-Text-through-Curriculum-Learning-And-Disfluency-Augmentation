As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and a okay half. What does what does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was a little um odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the roof. We you know had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably a fire like hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number one problem and really uh it was just bingo. So anybody so anybody could win and there were Current objects like of pleasure. I guess I guess you could say I'm not too sure what is uh safe for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but um also objects to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids on okay the watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded I mean money on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
