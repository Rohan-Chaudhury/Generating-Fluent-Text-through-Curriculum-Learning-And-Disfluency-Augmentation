I mean well I mean okay so well you know like. I was reading it through and it said if anyone ever comes to you uh well like well well uh you know okay saying all is well. They're from Satan and I'm thought thinking you kind of like like like so I mean um so well have that habit of of of telling us all is well and your own words. So so you know I mean uh uh um um. And so okay. So what I'm getting at is are there good angels and bad angels I mean so okay you know so okay I mean I mean and we want to remind you that that there is a stream of well-being so okay like like I mean you know uh um which you are allowing or not. And what and what and what and what and what and what and what and what and what we've noticed about any who for whatever reason I mean you know you know you know so like um well are standing in a place where they are not allowing their alignment with that well uh like well so so like you know stream of well-being because not being in vibrational alignment with the well-being that is so uh okay I mean so like okay okay so you is so painful from that painful place. That's always where you begin making your rules or dropping your bombs or trying to enforce things.
