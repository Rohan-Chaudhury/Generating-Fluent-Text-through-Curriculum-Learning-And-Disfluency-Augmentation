I'm Jason, I'm Rosie. I'm Paula. I'm sin and this is thoughts and confessions. Yo okay yo yo, what's up guys? What's up? What's up? So this week has been very interesting you know for me. I also like I've been dealing with some issues one can say towards well in terms of anger in terms of when people would say like Darkness. And like just trying to find the ways for me to be able to kind of marry that okay anger that I have inside with the positivity that I also have inside. We you know all go through that I guess so how deep it does the rabbit hole go super okay deep Bro Whitey. Yeah, like it's something that like I sort of I think it started when I actually traveled to Trinidad this year. So I went through the Christmas.
