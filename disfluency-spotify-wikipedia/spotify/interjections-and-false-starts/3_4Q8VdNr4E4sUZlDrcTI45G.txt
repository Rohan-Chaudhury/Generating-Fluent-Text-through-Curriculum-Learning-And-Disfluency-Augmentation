Has anybody ever surprise you with something really big? I don't really get surprised. Well okay well. I guess there was a time. I think it was my 18th birthday that okay okay well that I had a surprise birthday party, but I kind of got stiffed it out you know okay like a little bit the day up. But for the most part very few things surprise uh okay like me. It is it is it is it is difficult to imagine the way that the disciples must. Have felt okay I mean okay here towards the end of chapter 20 and the Book of John starting in verse 19 following it uh like like says this and the evening of that first day of the week when the disciples okay I mean um were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among you know like okay them and said peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were Overjoyed when they saw.
