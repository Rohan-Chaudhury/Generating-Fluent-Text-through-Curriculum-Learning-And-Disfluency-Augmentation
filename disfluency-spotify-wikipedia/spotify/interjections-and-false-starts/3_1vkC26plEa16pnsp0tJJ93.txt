The NFL the NFL the NFL the NFL combine is over. We're recording this on Monday well uh well morning. So at so at so at so at this point we've at least had a couple days to digest some of so like you know the performances from the skill position players and that's what we're going to talk about I mean you know okay today the offense of risers and fallers from the combine. And I know I said so uh uh this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you cannot freak out about I mean like you know one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes.
