So we okay well uh I mean uh just got a letter so for you here, we wanted to talk about a like so so like well few things that we've been stumbling upon over the last few days since the finale um like I mean uh you know and couple things we want to talk about before the reunions show just in case that I mean you know so you know um It gets wild and we don't want to you know, take up too much uh uh I mean you know you know time in the podcast after that. So we're yeah, the internet is swirling with post interviews like I mean okay um so and insights into the show. And I think now that they can be I mean um okay so so open and doing you know, you definitely see certain couples out there on the well well well I mean I mean interview circuit and making appearances. And so we just want to talk about what we I mean uh I mean okay well found out since the show and how we feel about it going into reunions and second seasons and spin-off and really we're looking for.
