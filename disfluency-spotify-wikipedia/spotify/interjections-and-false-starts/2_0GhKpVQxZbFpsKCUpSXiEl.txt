This is your everyday positivity here on Vale. Hello. I'm Kate Crocker. I hope I hope I hope you know well you're well today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough? I had a uh uh moment this week with my coach about accountability and I was really surprised. It's always it's always it's always you know like really surprising when you think I've got that bit sorted and I'm um um always really good at that and then someone asks you a question and you go always you know uh like that. I think I'm good at that or the time actually good I mean uh at that so I have been challenged this week and And it's hard. So I mean. It's hard pushing yourself through those challenges. It feels uncomfortable you okay you know get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and you your instinct says right. Okay well. I need to move away from this. I don't want to go there t um you know harv Eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets easy when like okay you do the hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard stuff. Like uh. So something is really challenging you at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
