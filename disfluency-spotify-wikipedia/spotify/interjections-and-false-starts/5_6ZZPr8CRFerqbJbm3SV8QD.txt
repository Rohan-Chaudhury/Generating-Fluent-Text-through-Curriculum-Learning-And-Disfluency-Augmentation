Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as uh okay okay um uh we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. Uh so um well like. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and I mean um okay so well you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of you know uh you know you know like making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath well um okay you know uh of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher you know like um uh uh than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins.
