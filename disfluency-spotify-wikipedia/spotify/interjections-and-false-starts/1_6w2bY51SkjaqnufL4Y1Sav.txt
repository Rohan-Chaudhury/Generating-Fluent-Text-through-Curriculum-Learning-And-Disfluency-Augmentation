Yes. Hi. I am calling this number because I saw it on a bathroom um wall. See if see if your Brandy greetings earthlings you're listening to Brandy is going to like hell and today is going to be extremely exciting. I have I have Adam Breeze of Raven like I with us but before we hop into that, I just wanted uh to go over I sold myself short on the last episode about my romantic uh capabilities. I think I think I came up on the last. Episode saying that I don't remember uh what I got. My boyfriend for Valentine's Day mentioning that I write thoughtful cards well out, but I personally think I've trumped his romantic capability is because I got him a like heart-shaped cheesecake covered in chocolate because he loves cheesecake and I also got him um Star Wars socks that were super cheesy with hearts all over the boxes. So dope after you listen.
