I've never even been to Oklahoma. I'm pretty sure it's where the wind goes okay like okay whipping down the plains and up until recently that's about what I knew of it. So I mean okay. But now I know it's also the ancestral home of two warring American uh um you know factions those no-good greasers and those rotten sotius. Greetings and welcome to fuckboys well I mean uh of literature. I'm your host Emily Edwards. What is it about this book? That just I mean so um gets it I mention it on Twitter and it gets love letters. So with me uh uh I mean today is writer journalist Leslie gray Streeter. How are you today? I am really good. I'm so you know well really good. Thank you. I am so excited to have you on because you suggested a book that I was embarrassed to say that I had. Never.
