So is so is so is so is so is so is so is so is so is so is so is he do you find like like uh I mean okay you know um like okay so it hard to balance time between all the stuff you do? Yes, it's very I mean well uh uh like um um okay like well tricky to balance my time between the a-levels bought everything else had girl duties, well you know well okay so so you know you know I mean uh but it's such an essential skill. That you have to learn especially when doing you know you know uh uh okay you know uh I mean um I mean gcses and a-levels.
