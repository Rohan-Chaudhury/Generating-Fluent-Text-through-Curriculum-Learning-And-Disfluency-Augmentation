I'm getting over being sick I mean and just getting over being sick. I'm fine. But just it's weird being sick um and trying to recoup its weird. But I'm headed. I'm headed I'm headed the right way. So. I'm headed the right direction. I think so, but yeah, thanks for asking. I'm glad well you're on. On the mend we did a couple patreon exclusive shows over the weekend um or Friday night and you were sounding a little rough. But at least you know, like you stuck it out for our wonderful patrons absolutely over there, which I know they appreciate uh so for this episode or actually before I get started with the episode make you know sure you're following us on our Instagram at Marvel Studios news. I'm doing I mean a lot of things over there doing daily MCU trivia, some of you are so doing very very well. Good job, but also we gave I put up a post on their a week or so ago offering an opportunity.
