As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and a half. Um you know you know I mean you know. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was uh uh you know well so a little odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the roof. I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean you know well I mean um. We had just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably a uh like I mean well okay fire hazard looking back at it but us being students not our number one problem and uh okay like well you know really it was just bingo. So anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody so anybody could win and there were Current so well you know uh okay objects of pleasure. I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess you could say I'm not too sure what is safe uh you know um like so for the radio. So I'm going to kind of curve that but also objects I mean like so so uh to practice safe sex like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the well okay so so you know watch of Plymouth State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money um you know I mean okay uh on these objects of pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
