Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and the topic uh of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind of interesting email well here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work and telling me you know how just in a short period of time. He's in a situation where I guess you know his he's been married. And he's and he's in the process of getting a divorce with like his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out she was uh having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing okay is he's completely changed his approach. He still moving forward with the divorce, but the so interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife um without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
