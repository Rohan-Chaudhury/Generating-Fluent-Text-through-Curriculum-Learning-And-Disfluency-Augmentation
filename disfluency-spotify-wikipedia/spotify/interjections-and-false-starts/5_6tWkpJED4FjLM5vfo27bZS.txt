The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel Lindsay so um okay okay okay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her reading so um uh well I mean shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully like like like like uh but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on okay well well uh so Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have so okay uh like you know its cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user and okay so like so um ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying um so uh um well and the show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The so okay well um like Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic like well so you know I mean environments. The show the show the show the show the show the show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a well well you know so okay villain. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season um well like um um there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity I mean like so I mean well and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
