It is it is it is it is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within well so okay a small range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed so well uh by every living cell. If there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough okay you know well energy if blood glucose levels are too high. This can this can this can this can have a negative impact on osmosis, um uh so which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows through um um like the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose so um uh if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone okay like so insulin into the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin so you know I mean these convert the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that you know I mean okay is insoluble and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the well you know like pancreas detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
