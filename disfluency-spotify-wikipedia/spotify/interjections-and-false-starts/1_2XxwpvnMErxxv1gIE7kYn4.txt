Alright, stay tuned. Welcome to the okay quickie and first before we get into the show, if you haven't heard about anchor before uh downloading it this time, it is the easiest way to make a podcast and I well encourage you to make your own podcast. It's fun and it's free. It's free I mean to download is free to be chord you talk. Anyway, you have conversations. Anyway, why well not record it and make money while you're doing it. There are creation tools that allow well you to record and edit your podcast right from your phone or your computer. Anchor will like distribute your podcast for you.
