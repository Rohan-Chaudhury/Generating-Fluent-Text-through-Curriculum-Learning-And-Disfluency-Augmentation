Again, the again, the again, the again, the again, the again, the again, the South Carolina absolutely unequivocally had to have and they did and it uh I mean um like well um wasn't the easiest road to victory for South. Carolina they got up big early so like um um uh like and then they squandered almost every single ounce of that lead going into halftime so like um you know you know um and then by the second half things kind of evened out in South Carolina, okay you know like like well uh they didn't Coast because you know, they only won by 12 and most um uh so like okay well of the time they were up by like six or something like that but it so so uh I mean like you know felt comfortable in South Carolina did it without getting a single spectacular performance but a lot okay um so I mean okay so of good performances from a lot of different areas and as much as we've uh you know um like so well talked about the strength of this team the upside of this team being the depth.
