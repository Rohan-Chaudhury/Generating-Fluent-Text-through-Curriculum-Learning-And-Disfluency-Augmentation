Hello, this is dr. POL Cottrell. I'll give you a little update on the like um um John Hopkins database. So right so right so right so right now we have confirmed ninety thousand four hundred twenty well like okay seven cases worldwide 300. I'm sorry 3116 deaths 40 7888 recovered and in the you know like um United States. We have now passed the hundred Mark. We're not at one. 102 so um I mean cases confirmed with six deaths all happening in Washington, which is interesting that we uh I mean like haven't had any deaths in California. And so and so and so and so there might be something specific look uh I mean I mean going on in terms of either how they're treating the patients or or the cohorts that are infected.
