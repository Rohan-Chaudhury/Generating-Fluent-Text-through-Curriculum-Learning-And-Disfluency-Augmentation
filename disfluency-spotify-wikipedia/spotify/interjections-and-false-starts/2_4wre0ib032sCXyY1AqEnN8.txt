Here on The Planet podcast, we don't shy away from tackling tough issues well well or try to create false images of ourselves. We think there is enough of that going you know well on in the world today. As a matter of fact, the inspiration behind this podcast so like is to speak to and in Fire regular folks through personal stories that being uh so real being vulnerable and being true to ourselves is not weak. Actually, it's so you know quite the opposite. We believe that true strength is revealed through our ability to continue um so to grow through our struggle and we want this podcast to serve as a reminder you know you know that in our Darkest Hours when we can't see the way out when our backs are you know I mean up against the wall and it feels like life has us buried we've only been planted.
