Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are so um like okay nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the metropolitan. Okay so okay. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due to the you know you know uh tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker because that would well you know well make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't care if um well like technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you like um I mean look at the points it is tied. This very moment and just the fact I mean so uh that that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes so like well me so happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half well so I mean of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
