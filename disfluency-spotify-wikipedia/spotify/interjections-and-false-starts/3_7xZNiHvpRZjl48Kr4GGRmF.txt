Hey everyone, hey everyone, hey everyone, hey everyone, welcome to episode 2 of the bestie breakdown with Erica and Shay. I um I um I um I um you know I mean have just some random stuff. I want us to talk about before we talk about well like so like life. So last episode we both talked about how we were so you know okay reading the Jessica Simpson book open book Shay. My question my question my question my question is no spoilers. We you we you we you we you know like like don't have to say anything in case you haven't read but we totally recommend it you know like you know Shea tell me if you would rather be Nick Lachey or John like okay uh Mayer after reading Jessica's back home - if I were John Mayer, I would be under well um uh a rock right now. I even went to his Instagram account. I don't I don't I don't I don't follow um um so him just to see if people were commenting. That's like the rabbit hole. I um um so went down when I read this but that bad it's not that bad. I went well um you know to his Instagram because I don't know in my head as I'm reading the book. I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like Shirley on his Instagram. All the comments are.
