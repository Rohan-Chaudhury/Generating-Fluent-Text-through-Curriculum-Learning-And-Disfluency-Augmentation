Hello, I'm hello, I'm hello, I'm hello, I'm Derek weekly and welcome to the fifth episode of the weekly weekly so uh so podcast and I want to thank you for listening liking and subscribing as so far um um um and want to touch another thing that I did last week. I made a mistake um uh well on the Caroline Flack part where I was talking about the meme she put out like I mean um and about be kind and I notice when I listen back to it that I okay so okay said be nice. It's not a big mistake. It's not a big difference, but uh uh like You know my OCD kicked in and I kind of wanted to set well so like it right to talk about kindness as well and want to give a shout out to my friend.
