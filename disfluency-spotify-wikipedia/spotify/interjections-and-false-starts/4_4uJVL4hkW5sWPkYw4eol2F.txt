Hello and welcome along to the property Academy podcast. I'm your host Ed Makai time you know um so um major Nicole today on the show. We're going to be talking about gross rental yields okay um uh I mean in Parnell. Now, you now, you now, you now, you now, you might be wondering why are we talking about Parnell given that I mean you know okay okay which is an affluent suburb in Auckland given that it is probably not likely an so you know so I mean investor suburb or a suburb that you'd actually invest in. Well a couple of weeks uh um um I mean ago. I got the call-up from Westpac one of the large banks in New Zealand uh so you know uh and they said can you comment on an article that we're writing for our well like like I mean website where they were showing by the latest core logic data that the the median gross um so well uh rental yield on a three-bedroom house and Parnell is 2.2 percent. Whereas a one-bedroom well um you know I mean apartment and Parnell the gross yield for that is 5.1% and they said it can I mean well um um you give us some comment on this and which case they probably got more?.
