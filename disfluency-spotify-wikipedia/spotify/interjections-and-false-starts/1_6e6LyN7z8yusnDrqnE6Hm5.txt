Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 13 of the more, you know podcast. Um. This is no l am speaking. And today. I'm going to talk about giving up um Perfection or this idea of perfection for progress. And for peace. I think I think I like think that it's it's where we find peace when we accept that. We are imperfect you know like Just it's The Human Condition. I want you to know that every okay single person on planet Earth is not getting it. All right, all right, they may look like well they're getting it right because there's maybe one facet of their life that they're really focused on and I mean really paying a lot of attention to but I'm gonna guarantee like seriously, I'm gonna uh guarantee that there's other parts of their lives that are sacrificing because of it, right I look at life now is.
