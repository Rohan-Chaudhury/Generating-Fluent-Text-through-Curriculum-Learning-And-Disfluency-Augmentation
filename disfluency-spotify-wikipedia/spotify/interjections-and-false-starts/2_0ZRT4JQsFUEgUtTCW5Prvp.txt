What up, guys? This is the Leafs convo pod cast for Oak Ridge Ford in um uh London, Ontario Oak Ridge Ford.com. I'm enje along with Mike. It is Thursday, I mean uh March 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a little well okay pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk okay so after the Leafs loss in San Jose. But hey, but hey, but hey, that's okay. They had they had they had won I mean um three in a row prior The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, uh like it does but you have to sort of reflect on the fact that um you know the Leafs won three games in. Road that we're key games against teams that were like I mean at least on par with them Florida a few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead I mean um of them in the Atlantic division and Vancouver who was battling for a playoff spot in the like okay Western Conference. They come up against the team and they play three teams you know you know on this west coast swing that are out of it that are basically, you so like know, playing out the string and they got outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks. I have to say that Jack Campbell kept him in.
