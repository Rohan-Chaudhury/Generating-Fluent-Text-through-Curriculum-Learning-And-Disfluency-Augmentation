Sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the things well, like well well I mean okay there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers me that the kids um you know like like okay do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's six of us in this I mean like I mean I mean uh household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed to sit on a like so well I mean I mean couch not walk on it not run on it now jump on I mean I mean okay um uh it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's for well uh you know like um sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know they're not supposed I mean well I mean um okay to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little Skipper. Ooh on the couch, I mean like well okay um but when you catch them, I have a tendency to overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
