And yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, I have um okay so uh a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my coach because I um okay so uh had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how hard it can like you know uh well be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to fall into this pattern of so uh so uh just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. A way, which I know better than to like so like um do but I just kind of got caught in a loop and it's one of you know like um um my weaknesses. Well so my coach said something to me so very profound and uh um well you know the shift that it has created since then has been so powerful that he um so I mean um just knew that I had to share it with you. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Which is which is which is which is which is keeping your eye.
