Oh, we are back to the 26th interview episode of Home Advantage today. We I mean are joined. Once again by Jani Yakima Hollis. This was a very special episode. I like so these episodes because we don't really go through the chronological career of the competitor or the well coach that we interview in this case. We interviewed. And since it was the second like time we had him on we'd already covered his career. And so I got uh to talk about a lot of things on this show and I had okay I'd get to hear a lot of Yanni's Insight on a lot of uh different things and we kind of went through a couple topics one was his little uh brother Greg just want his fifth State title High School in New York. And so we um talked a little bit about that and then Greg coming to Cornell. He's competing in the Pan Am championships coming up here soon and.
