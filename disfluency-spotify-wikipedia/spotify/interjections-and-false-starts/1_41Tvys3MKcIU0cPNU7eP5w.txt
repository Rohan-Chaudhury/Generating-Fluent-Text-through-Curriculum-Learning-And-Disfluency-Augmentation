Yo, yo, yo, what's up everyone? I guess I'll kick off this podcast addressing so probably the biggest talk in sports right now. Tom Brady greatest of all time Now I mean if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you that he's staying put you know but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying put it just I mean doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody that has been I mean in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one team just like doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense to me. So well so well it doesn't make sense to me for this man the go out and play for you know another team at 43 years old after spending his entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just it just doesn't make sense for.
