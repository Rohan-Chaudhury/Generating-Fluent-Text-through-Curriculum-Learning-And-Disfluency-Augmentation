Sometimes as a parent you just have to be ridiculous one of the uh you know uh you know well I mean like I mean things well, there's many things but one of the one of them that bothers uh okay um you know like you know okay uh me that the kids do would be standing or walking on the couch. There's like well so you know you know well like I mean six of us in this household and this couch is falling apart. You're supposed um so well like like um like okay to sit on a couch not walk on it not run on it you know um like okay I mean okay okay uh now jump on it and dance on it. Do not do WWF moves on it. It's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like I mean well so uh I mean okay like for sitting that's it. So when you catch them doing it because they know I mean um um so like well um well they're not supposed to but they just can't help themselves, but do a little skipper. Uh um like you know okay um like well. Ooh on the couch, but when you catch them, I have a tendency to okay so well you know um well you know well overdo it. I'll tell them to stop walking on the couch. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop walking on the couch stop.
