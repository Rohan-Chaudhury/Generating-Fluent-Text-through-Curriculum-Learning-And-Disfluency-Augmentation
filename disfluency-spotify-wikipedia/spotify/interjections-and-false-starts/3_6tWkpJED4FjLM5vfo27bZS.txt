The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when so um so Rachel Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her you know you know um reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled Tastefully like um well but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion uh well um on Reddit passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to um okay you know have its cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user like like like and ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying I mean you know um and the show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point well uh like at The Bachelor show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in okay well like facilitating toxic environments. The show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having um uh well a villain. You can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every well you know okay single season there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past um you know so infidelity and then confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
