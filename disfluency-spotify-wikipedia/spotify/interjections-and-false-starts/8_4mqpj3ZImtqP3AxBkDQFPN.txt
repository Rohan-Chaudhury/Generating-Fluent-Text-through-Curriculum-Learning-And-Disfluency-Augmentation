Hey, this is Elise and you're listening to Cool Moms podcast. Not like a regular okay I mean so well I mean well like uh Mom. I'm a cool mom. Welcome back. Y'all. Thanks for listening. I have had some I mean well okay like so okay okay you know shit on my mind per usual that I wanted to share of one of which you know you know I mean okay like so I mean uh is the fact that I have literally not had a job for the past. So well uh okay um well like okay. Really long time and like my adult life probably aside from like a gig like I mean okay uh well well well um here and a gig there to the disappointment of my mother and my bank I mean uh um like well so okay um account. I have not consistently been working and I think that's for a few reasons. You know well like so um I mean so I mean. One of which is the fact that I don't like going to work just to be like.
