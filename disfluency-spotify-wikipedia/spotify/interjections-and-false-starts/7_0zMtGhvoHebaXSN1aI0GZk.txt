It is important for an organism to keep its blood glucose levels within a small okay okay well you know well okay well range Lucas is important for respiration respiration releases The energy needed by every living cell. Um okay well um like okay like. If there if there if there if there if there if there if there if there is not enough glucose an organism cannot produce enough energy if uh well like like okay well so blood glucose levels are too high. This can have a negative impact on osmosis, um okay um uh like okay um which is the movement of water between cells by affecting concentration gradients as blood flows you know um uh uh like like um through the pancreas. The body can detect if there is a high concentration. Enough blood glucose like okay okay well so like uh if the concentration of blood glucose is too high the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into like like well so you know uh well the bloodstream the liver and muscle tissues detect the presence of insulin these convert uh well you know you know so well well the excess glucose into glycogen glycogen as a form of glucose that is insoluble you know so so I mean um so uh and can be stored for later. Use this process continues until the pancreas uh um I mean um well like you know detects a normal blood glucose concentration. If the concentration of blood glucose is too low the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon.
