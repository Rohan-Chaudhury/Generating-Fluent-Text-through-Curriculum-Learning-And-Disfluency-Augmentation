Spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so tune so tune out if you so like well want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported I reported I reported I reported that Madison like I mean so Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in like you know so the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie um um okay was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because you know so like Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this okay well so straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette okay I mean okay so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other I mean like like reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now like I mean like I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down okay you know you know in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But uh okay I mean if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier like uh I mean today.
