And other days it's going to feel hopeless and like you know you know so well uh you know things aren't working out and you're just a ridiculous hopeless dreamer, especially if you got you know well uh okay uh um people chirping in your ear and your life telling you what a stupid like like uh you know um well idea that you've embarked on or that business you want to build or that career you uh okay uh I mean okay you know want to have is just unrealistic for you.
