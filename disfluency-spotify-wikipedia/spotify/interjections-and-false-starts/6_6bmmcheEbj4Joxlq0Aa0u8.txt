At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came well like you know uh um uh over a Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was okay well I mean like uh um about six feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its so I mean um um uh like time sitting on the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to uh well um I mean well I mean notice a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person uh well uh well well okay who lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out uh so like well so um of sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the okay well so I mean uh I mean river suddenly much to his surprise. Here comes here comes here comes here comes here comes here comes here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. Like uh you know so okay um. This was obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated I mean okay well um so I mean Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a while. You know um uh um uh okay. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
