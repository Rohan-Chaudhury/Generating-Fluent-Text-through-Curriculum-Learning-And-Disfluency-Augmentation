I'm from Monroe Welcome To Live Like You're Dying the podcast my personal journey of living you know okay with terminal cancer has led me to believe that most of the perceived so okay problems and worries going on in our heads could be changed by embracing. The I mean I mean simple fact that we all only have one life and that none of us okay you know are promised another day on this beautiful planet. We all call home regardless. Of uh you know our current health status after all would you seriously stay in the job you hate like uh or the relationship that makes you miserable. If you if you if you truly felt your life could end well so next year. Hell no, you'd be out doing the things that make you happy so uh and you certainly wouldn't be worrying about your dress size either in this groundbreaking I mean so podcast. I interview people who are living incredible lives not despite adversity, but the cause of it through their inspiring stories. You.
