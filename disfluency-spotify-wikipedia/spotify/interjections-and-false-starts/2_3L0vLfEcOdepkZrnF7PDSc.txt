Hey y'all. Welcome to welcome to welcome to La world. I'm so sorry. I'm a I'm a I'm a fucking week late. Well uh. I was supposed to be so fucking consistent but last week I came to New Orleans my okay like hometown and it was mighty grind. It was just a lot of stuff going on uh you know and I could have recorded like the days after but I had so much shit you know you know like a dentist's appointment. I had to go get my pap. Smear I smear I smear I have um so errands to run I was linking with people that I see in a I mean uh while. Basically, I really didn't have time and then I'm staying in New Orleans and my uh well mom house and then my brother's over here and nephews and it be loud like um okay I'm finally recording because now I'm finally in my house and no one's here right now, which um you know is kind of rare. So I'm trying to record before somebody try to come get back. So hopefully they'll be gone for these 20 minutes, but I'm back home been.
