Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So well so uh well okay okay like um like well for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original old like well like I mean I mean okay okay I mean uh uh school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was one uh okay well well um well like I mean uh you know of my mother's favorite. So I think it was one of the first I mean well well I mean okay okay well uh so um ones she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie uh I mean okay like so I mean uh so okay um when I was about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and so well well um you know um you know I mean well you know violence seems wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself okay uh well so okay you know you know uh uh uh that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
