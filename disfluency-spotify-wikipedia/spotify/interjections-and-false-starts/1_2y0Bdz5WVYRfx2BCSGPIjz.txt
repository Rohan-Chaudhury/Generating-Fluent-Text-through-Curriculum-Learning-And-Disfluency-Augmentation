together growing together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how Jesus well after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets up and so he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to be I mean with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with the I mean father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him you know and he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says uh while I needed to be with the father but also need to go somewhere else. So. They something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is so the attitude of Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being with God you know the father in prayer. He begins it. By taking by taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
