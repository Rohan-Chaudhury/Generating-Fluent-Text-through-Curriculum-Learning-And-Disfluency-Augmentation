It is Thursday, March so well like 5th 2020 the Leafs at the LA Kings this evening. It's a it's a it's a it's a little uh okay like pregame combo for you Michael. We didn't get a chance to talk after the Leafs like I mean so loss in San Jose. But hey, that's okay. They had they had they had they had won three in I mean so um a row prior The Beat Goes On good morning Norm. Yeah, it does but you you know so um have to sort of reflect on the fact that the Leafs won three like like um games in. Road that road that road that road that we're key games against teams that were at least on par so uh um with them Florida a few points behind them Tampa Bay ahead of them in the okay so you know Atlantic division and Vancouver who was battling for a playoff spot in the Western uh well I mean Conference. They come up against the team and they play three teams on this west coast swing that you know so okay are out of it that are basically, you know, playing out the string and they got okay so you know outplayed dramatically by the San Jose Sharks.
