Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going well like well uh you know uh well well okay like through a kemetic meditation. So the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the so the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying I mean I mean I mean so you know um uh okay uh okay down on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can also uh like so well I mean you know well you know well so do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to make sure you know so like so like um uh you know well I mean that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if um you know I mean like okay well okay you know okay so you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your um okay okay um I mean you know uh I mean I mean like feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find either I mean so uh I mean I mean I mean you know okay so well you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find you know I mean I mean okay uh okay you know I mean okay uh your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
