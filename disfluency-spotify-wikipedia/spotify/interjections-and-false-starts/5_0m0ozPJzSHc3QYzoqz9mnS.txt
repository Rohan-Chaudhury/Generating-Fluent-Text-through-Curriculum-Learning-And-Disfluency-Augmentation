The other night after the show, I was talking to some some girls that were well okay I mean I mean uh friends and they wanted to start a podcast and they were asking me how we um you know like well you know do it how we get it out there how we record it. And you know, thankfully I uh so you know you know uh was able to tell them about anchor which if we would have had when we first uh like um I mean well started out this would have been way way easier and it's much easier. It is now I mean uh uh well so gotten super easy, you know, so anchor is by far the easiest way I mean so so um like to make a podcast it gives you everything you need. In one in one in one in one in one in one place so like uh I mean like okay you don't have to get Pro Tools or any fancy recording equipment or anything um okay uh so so and you can literally make a podcast and edit it on your phone right you know well you know well well there free. It's free. It's free. So it gives you all the creation tools. You like uh um um like need to edit it to make it sound good which you know, if we um I mean so I mean like didn't have a background and recording, you know, it just makes it so easy. I mean we've recorded.
