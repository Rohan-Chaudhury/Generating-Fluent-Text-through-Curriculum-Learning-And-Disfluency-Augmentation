Hello, everyone. Dr. Davidson Edmund. I hope everybody's doing very well and staying healthy. Um so well. Today we're going to talk about their coronavirus. But first of all, I'd like you know okay um to introduce myself to those who don't who don't doesn't know me. I'm a I mean like I mean board certified Family Medicine physician I practice in Oxford, Alabama. I see I see I see I see you about 40 50 okay um um patients a day and the office I'll still go to the hospital and usually I mean well you know have a census. It's been 5 to 15 patients, including ICU and critical heal patients. I mean uh like. So literally my patients have been very worried about the core virus and to be honest okay well um who is not been worried about this. Okay? And therefore I've had multiple questions regarding, you know, what what what they can do to protect.
