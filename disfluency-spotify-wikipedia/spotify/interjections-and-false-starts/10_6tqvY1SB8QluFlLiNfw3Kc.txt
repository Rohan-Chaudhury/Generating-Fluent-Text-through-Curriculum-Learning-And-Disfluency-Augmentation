Now Sports talk with brodes here's Hunter Brody Yui, yui you is the fires are I mean okay well so um okay uh uh uh okay so nasty. They are now tied with the Washington Capitals in first place of the metropolitan. Like like okay like uh okay like I mean uh uh. Well, technically I understand the Caps are still in first place due like okay um okay so I mean so like like okay to the tiebreak, which is crazy to me that head-to-head. Is it the tiebreaker like okay like so um like so okay you know uh because that would make the most sense, but of course not listen, I don't uh so like uh so I mean so you know I mean so care if technically they're not in first. All I care about is when you um I mean okay like uh uh I mean like uh um look at the points it is tied. This very this very this very this very this very this very this very this very this very this very this very moment and just the fact that like I mean like um I mean like so okay I mean uh that is the situation we are discussing right now is what makes me so you know okay uh okay well okay okay well well like happy. So the Flyers beat the Carolina Hurricanes four to one on a second half um you know well okay you know I mean so um so so of a back-to-back back in the day maybe earlier this season I would have been concerned about this game.
