Hello and welcome to another episode of The fbl Hangover podcast where we raised well you know like um um a bear and lower the tone all things FPL related this week folks. We are so well you know you know um going to take you on a journey blank to the Future and before you and ask I mean like um you know like where we are going. You don't need green arrows and that's a good thing like you know you know like uh because you're not going to get them here at least not in this episode uh um okay like I mean kind of a topsy-turvy week that saw several Blast from the Past so so um uh okay tear up the usual FPL narratives and cause some innocent podcasters like myself, too. 80s you know okay well uh okay film references and of course I'm talking about the likes of a Macos Alonso brace uh like like uh like which Drew assisted one. I believe Leighton Baines reminding us why in many ways he could well I mean uh like um be considered a precursor to America's Alonso. And of course, let's not forget Liverpool getting absolutely twatted by Watford. But before we get into this any.
