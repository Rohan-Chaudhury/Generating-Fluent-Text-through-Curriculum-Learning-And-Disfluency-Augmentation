Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with I mean your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for tuning in okay in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why when and you know how of this podcast. So before so before you decide to listen to me, let me at okay least help you understand who I am. I've been I've been an RD for about um 5 years now. I've worked I've worked in many different places. I started off at a you know nursing home from there. I was able to go into a clinic Uncle setting working okay at New York Presbyterian Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice World, uh which is really where I wanted to be I was able to sit with people for you know longer periods of time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were so able to see each other for a bit more than five or ten minutes and like you're working in the clinical setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes in you know between the doctors. The patients are really tired at this point because they've been here uh for a while and then I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
