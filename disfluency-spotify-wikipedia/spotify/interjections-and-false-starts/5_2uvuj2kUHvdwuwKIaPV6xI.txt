He glanced he glanced he glanced he glanced he glanced he glanced out a window to watch the Summer sun setting over um well like you know I mean San Jose the largest city in Northern, California. But his life wasn't as idyllic as well um I mean you know so it seemed after dinner. He went to his bedroom and injected himself with Heroin you know um uh uh you know just like most nights but right away something felt different. It was all wrong. Okay um okay okay uh. The drugs burned hot through his veins unlike anything.

The next morning he awoke with a start he could barely move. It.
