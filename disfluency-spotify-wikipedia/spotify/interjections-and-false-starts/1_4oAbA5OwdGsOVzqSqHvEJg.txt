Hey, what is up CI squads? We're back. We're back we're back with another episode, 's like I'm pretty energized right now. Just got off the back of doing some live so training to Bluestone College. I did four locations in one hit which is um the power of the internet and amazing technological breakthrough where you can be in four uh places at one time. So very very exciting stuff and that's kind of inspired. Well. Is this little podcast that I'm putting together for you today? But before we get into that, I mean I want to give a shout out so over the last couple of weeks. I mean. I've been running a little bit of a giveaway. So for anyone that leaves a okay review on iTunes and sends me over a screenshot. I will enter them into I mean a draw to win a little little gift from me. So I just been scanning the reviews we've had some new reviews come through and I'm going to pick how.
