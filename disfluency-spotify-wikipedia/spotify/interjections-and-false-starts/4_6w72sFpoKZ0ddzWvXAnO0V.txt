Welcome to welcome to welcome to welcome to welcome to biology for bastards teaching biology and um well like like the most profane way you've ever seen or heard. I'm your host John Doe d. Well I mean well uh. Thanks for listening this season. We're going through AP Biology one chapter at a time this I mean well you know so week. We're on the chapter 24, which is titled the Origin of Species, but it's not even fucking about Darwin like what the shit?.
