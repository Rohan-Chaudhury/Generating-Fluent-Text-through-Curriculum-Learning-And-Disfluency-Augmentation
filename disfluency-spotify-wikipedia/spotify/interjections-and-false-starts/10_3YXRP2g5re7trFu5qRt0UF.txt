Uh um like so you know so well so I mean well. You know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to okay you know uh so like uh you know so uh well serve each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's like we're okay um so I mean like I mean well so I mean okay you can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know was you know uh I mean well I mean um okay you know you know I mean a success not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because we so I mean you know like uh um so like okay so just weren't having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways meaningful ways to make like uh I mean well uh I mean so I mean well well you know, a lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that it's well um okay uh like you know you know you know I mean um just a bunch of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
