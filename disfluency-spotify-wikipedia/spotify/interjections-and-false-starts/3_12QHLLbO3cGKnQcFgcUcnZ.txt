Then you then you then you then you will know that I like well I mean post regular devotionals in the mornings to encourage us with the word of god. You know well well. And that is basically the whole heart of this podcast will be well um um looking at real life scenarios and situations, but the End of that, we'll be like um you know using and speaking very specific scriptures that we can use in those you know so so challenges. My heart behind this is that as we go through tests and trials which so um so we can't obviously avoid but we will our mindset that we would go through uh uh like it will be different. I am so convinced and I have been challenged myself to I mean well so apply the word of God when I've been going through challenges situations and interceding for others and so.
