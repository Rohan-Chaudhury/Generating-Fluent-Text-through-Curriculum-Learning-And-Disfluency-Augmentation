For over 300 years treasure hunters and adventurers have been searching for Blackbeard's fabled treasure. Well like uh. So far. Nobody has been able to find it Michael Rockefeller the like like like youngest son of then New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was on a catamaran off the southwestern I mean well okay coast of what is now New Guinea when it flipped over he tried to swim I mean you know I mean to shore, but he was never seen again DB Cooper hijacked a Boeing. 7:27 extorted so well well two hundred thousand dollars in Ransom and then parachuted to an uncertain fate. These uh you know uh all have one thing in common, they're gone, but we're looking for them. Okay um I mean. And now we're working twice as hard as gone is now a weekly show uh okay I mean in addition to our regular shows every other Monday.
