Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place suddenly so a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled um the whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be tongues you know of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of all of them were filled okay with the Holy Spirit and began. To speak in other tongues as the spirit enabled them. Um. Now there was staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment.
