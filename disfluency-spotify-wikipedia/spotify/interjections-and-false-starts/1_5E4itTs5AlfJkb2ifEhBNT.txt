Oh, hey guys. Hello surprise back. We got a little we just missed you you know guys. So we so we just got a letter so for you here, we wanted to talk about a uh few things that we've been stumbling upon over the last few days since the finale uh and couple things we want to talk about before the reunions show just in case that okay It gets wild and we don't want to you know, take up too much like time in the podcast after that. So we're yeah, the internet is swirling with post interviews uh and insights into the show. And I think now that they can be well open and doing you know, you definitely see certain couples out there on like the interview circuit and making appearances. And so we just want to talk about what um we found out since the show and how we feel about it going into reunions and second seasons and spin-off and really we're looking for.
