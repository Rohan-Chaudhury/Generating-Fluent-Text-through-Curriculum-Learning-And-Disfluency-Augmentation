Welcome back to best our of their day on today's episode. We are well I mean um talking about the principle of quarter extremity that idea of quarter extremity movement. But you know uh well also quarter extremity movement violations, we're going to dive specifically today into the importance of uh well um it and where to look in a handful of different movements. So Fern like well okay first question I have for you is when were you first introduced to the concept? you know well I mean out of quarter extremity the book definition of it at the level 1 course, however physically like um okay introduced to it probably day one is an athlete like as a little kid. I mean okay I mean. They just they just they just they just don't teach it that way but when you teach any type of throwing okay like you know mechanics, typically the first thing you teaching most kids to do is probably jumping or throwing uh like okay something right. So throwing a football or baseball as a child and and learning how to do that. That's.
