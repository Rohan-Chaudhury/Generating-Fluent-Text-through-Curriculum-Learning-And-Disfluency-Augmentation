You're sitting on the couch with Vincent Taylor. I'm a colorist for film television like and everything in between when my clients come into the color grading sweet to um work on their projects. They sit on this color couch of mine for an so hour a day or weeks on end depending on the project those well clients might be directors writers producers or cinematographers. It varies it varies considerably depending on the um project now our work. On the project we talked about a whole bunch of interesting like things. Sometimes it's color but not necessarily and that is what the color couch is I mean all about. It's a glimpse behind the curtain of film and television the podcast you know will talk about color from time to time, but it's really about what brought uh my clients my guests to the color couch. How did how did I get to this place in.
