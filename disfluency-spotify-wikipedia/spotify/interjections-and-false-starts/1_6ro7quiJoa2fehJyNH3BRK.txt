Usually I usually I wait to reflect on my guest and work on the you know introduction for Saturday mornings. There's no sleeping in my house because uh we have a puppy and he likes to get up really early. But today's a little okay bit different. I keep thinking about our guest. Mrs. Whitman's story. I know I know her story so is going to resonate with so many of you out there. I want I want uh you to listen. This one all the way through. If you don't know. Mrs. Whitman, like you're going to know her pretty well at the end of this half hour like episode this half hour goes by fast. Now. I know this sounds like a uh Shameless plug but it isn't please share the episode people need to hear her story. They need okay to hear about her resiliency. They need to hear about how she weather's so many so different storms that have taken place in her life. Thanks for listening. Please let me know uh what you think write a review.
