It is really sad to be looking across the stage at somebody that you know, you well you know well you know I mean um I mean okay I mean done fucking split cans of tuna with and y'all can t have a conversation. You well well well okay like well well you know so know, I'm saying the only moment y'all have is because we're just here to serve uh um okay well well you know you know so well each other to get this money and then we walking apart. So it's like we're you you know um um I mean I mean I mean uh so uh can't even enjoy the success when you ask that question, you know was a success so I mean uh so uh like so uh um not enough to sustain it. I don't think it was enough because we just weren't uh uh I mean okay I mean well like uh you know having fun. When we weren't enjoying each other. Meaningful ways to make you know, a so well uh you know so you know um so I mean lot of us joke the Twitter can be totally useless that it's just a bunch you know so I mean um I mean okay uh I mean so of idiots run wild a cesspool and blah blah blah, but let me tell you about that time that Twitter introduced me to what eventually.
