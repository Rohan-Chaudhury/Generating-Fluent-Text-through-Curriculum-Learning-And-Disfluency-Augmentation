As sex Bingo night here at Plymouth State and it was a hoot and well uh uh like um um I mean a half. What does sex Bingo and tail because I missed that so it was a little like so you know well um you know like odd knocking alive, but the camaraderie in that room was through the roof. We had so you know I mean okay so like you know just about over a hundred people in one room, which was probably a fire hazard looking back uh well like I mean like um uh at it but us being students not our number one problem and really it was like I mean um like well so so just bingo. So anybody could win and there were Current objects of pleasure. I guess um well I mean well so I mean um you could say I'm not too sure what is safe for the radio. So so well uh like you know I mean I mean I'm going to kind of curve that but also objects to practice safe sex so well okay I mean um so well like our ad reads. So nobody was getting Aids on the watch of Plymouth so okay well uh um uh okay State. There's over a thousand dollars dropped Plymouth state funded money on these objects of um like uh you know uh so um pleasure and honestly a strange investment personally I thought but also what brings the community closer together.
