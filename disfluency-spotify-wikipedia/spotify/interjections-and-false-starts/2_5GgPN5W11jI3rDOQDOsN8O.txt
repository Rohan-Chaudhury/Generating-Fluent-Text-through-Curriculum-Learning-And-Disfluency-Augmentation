Hello, beautiful people and welcome to waking youth. My name is got a lotta well uh gibberish. I'll be your host and I have to say I'm extremely happy to be like you know here with you today. And in this episode, I'll just be introducing waking uh uh youth. How did I come up with this idea? And what and what and what waking youth is all so well about so over the summer I was listening to a lot of podcasts and I mean uh I was thinking that I really wanted to work and focus on my creativity and okay well when I started the semester I am Third-year communication student in Spain. I was also so well looking for an initiative and I was feeling very stressed and very anxious I mean you know and I realized that a lot of my friends were also feeling like this because I mean okay we're obviously we're very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and.
