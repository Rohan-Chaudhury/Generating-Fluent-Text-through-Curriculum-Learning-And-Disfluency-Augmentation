Welcome to the first ever episode of version final a podcast about where ideas um come from. I'm Ben Pereira and I'm a strategist at cnx. The creative agency accounting like Nest. Our aim our aim is to talk to creative people in advertising media publishing technology like education and more the ideation process can be a little bit of a black box like to those of us who aren't designated creatives in organizations. We hope these conversations uh can shed some light on that as work becomes more D industrialized and more you know service-based more and more of us are expected to be creative as part of so our jobs. Our hope is that by talking to people who work daily with like incorporate constraints and still managed to be consistently creative the rest of us can learn uh how to tap into our own creative sides the idea for doing a okay podcast about ideas came from watching how Conde Nast magazine Brands operate cnx and Conde Nast magazine Brands create content for different purposes, but we work pretty.
