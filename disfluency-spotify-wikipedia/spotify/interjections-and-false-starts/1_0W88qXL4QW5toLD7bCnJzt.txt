Hey dedicated listener to The Machinist therapy hotline, as you can imagine when um we are recording our podcast. We have hours of audio that we have to sift through so more often than not the level of conversation is at such a high intellectual okay point that we're not sure if it really can get into the podcast. We okay thought we might share one of them with you now, but remember if you you know want to be involved, don't forget. You send you send us a DM. Send us well your questions and we'll go from there. We hope you enjoyed today's episode. Thanks. I you know did I did the whole sort of winning the Florida when the Clear Water okay went down. I did like did Miami and then sort of come back round uh again and went into they had one of those what's it called the like the Everglades stole fan boat thingies, whatever. Yeah, and.
