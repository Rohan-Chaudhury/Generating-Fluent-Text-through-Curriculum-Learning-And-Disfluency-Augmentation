Just talking about random stuff, you okay like like like you know I mean um know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then as I recorded so um uh I mean well like like the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the well you know uh uh uh well uh theme of this podcast should be. So if you know notice a lot of the things okay uh well uh well like I mean that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up uh I mean I mean like uh uh okay and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so okay okay like like so um with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I um so I mean you know so um well finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing um well I mean you know uh uh um up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically uh I mean I mean uh like well uh having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.
