Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be so like so um um explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more so so um so well masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an important I mean I mean you know I mean so topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny I mean uh uh I mean you know or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of what they okay like okay um like would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is this is this is this is this is this is like well I mean like I mean ridiculously important to your happiness. And not only that if you want to become a okay you know I mean like well man of value so that way other men or other people in general can lean um uh so um so on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If uh okay okay um well you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit I mean okay well well so there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very okay uh you know like so well. Okay, because this video might take me a little bit to explain so well um well I mean so grab a pen grab a paper. If you can't take five to ten minutes okay um I mean um you know to learn this material you're going to be seriously flawed when it comes to the real.
