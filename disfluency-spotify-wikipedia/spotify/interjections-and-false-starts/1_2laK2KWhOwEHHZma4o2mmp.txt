The Brian Golf Show for presented by Cobra Puma golf actual truck. Yeah, real good uh form before we get to talking about anything and everything to do with golf well shafts. I got I got to give a big thank you to the man on the phone. His so name is Don Brown. He is he is the senior director of marketing Innovation for uh True Sports is golf division up true Sports encompasses a lot. I know like Don that you have a lot of product not just in the Gulf side, uh but true also has what a Baseball division a Hockey division lacrosse. Am I am I uh correct on all this before? Before we get going. Yeah, that is correct. So I so I mean true Sports, so we were formerly known as True Timber Sports until about okay the middle of last year and then you know, we have a hockey Division. I okay lacrosse division are Baseball division and they are all branded true. So it so made sense for the parent company recalled to sports as opposed to True Temper sports or like to Templars were really just our golf division. So yeah, so yeah, we make a wide range of a cross product and hockey we dress players from the states to the helm.
