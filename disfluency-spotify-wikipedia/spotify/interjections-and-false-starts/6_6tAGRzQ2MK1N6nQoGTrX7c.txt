So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down like uh I mean so so like on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You can um okay so you know like uh also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to okay uh okay so like well make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if uh um um uh uh so you have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair like I mean I mean you know you know uh have your feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So well so well so well so well so well so well so well you know like um like like once you find either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want I mean so like uh so like you to find your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel um well like like like like and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
