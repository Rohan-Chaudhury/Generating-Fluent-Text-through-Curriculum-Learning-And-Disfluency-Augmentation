So their focus is all about execution of strategy. Okay, many people come up you know you know okay okay with great ideas. Great strategies great initiatives and every year they spent countless hours like I mean uh uh countless efforts of prepare. During creating recreating the till business plan or even set like so um you know of strategic plans and sometimes they also hire very expensive Consultants to do so, but like uh I mean okay the problem is sometimes most of the effort goes to waste why because they like well uh so don't really put extra effort to make sure that they do have a systematic approach to follow up follow through.
