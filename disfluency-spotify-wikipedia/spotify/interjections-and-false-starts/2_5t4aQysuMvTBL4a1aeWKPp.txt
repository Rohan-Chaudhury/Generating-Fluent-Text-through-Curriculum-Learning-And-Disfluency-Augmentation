From Vice and exclusive to Spotify you listening to extremes with me Julian okay okay Morgan's. This is the show that explores the far ends of human experience. And today I mean um we're looking at one of the weirdest most ambitious science experiments of the 20th century. Well so. It's a story about for men and for women who are locked inside this enormous uh you know glass dome for two years just to see what would happen. And as you'd so I mean imagine it all went a little bit Lord of the Flies. I think things started uh you know to get a bit uncomfortable rarely about the four to six month Mark. I um so think we all knew instinctively that if ever anybody opened up physically to anybody else, you know, if we exchanged any kind of blows, that was it.
