Hi, I'm coach Cory Wayne. And this is my video coaching newsletter and okay um okay um the topic of today's newsletter is going to be gaining Clarity and closure. What kind like you know okay like of interesting email here from a guy who writes in thanking me for my work like well so I mean and telling me how just in a short period of time. He's in a like uh okay uh situation where I guess his he's been married. And he's in the process of like you know so well getting a divorce with his wife and apparently about 6-8 weeks ago. He found out I mean okay um you know she was having an emotional affair with some other guy apparently. So the interesting thing I mean well uh so is he's completely changed his approach. He still he still he still he still he still moving forward with the divorce, but the uh I mean you know so interesting thing is he's hanging out having fun and hooking up with his wife um um so you know without any kind of attachments or worried about what may or may not happen in the future with her and he feels great.
