Hi, this is Megan and this is Kimberly and welcome to room 237. So well for our first episode we're going to get into the movie Carrie the original um old school one from 1976. So I'm particularly excited about this one. It was it was um one of my mother's favorite. So I so I think it was one of the first um ones she saw in the theater growing up. I was introduced to this movie when I was so about nine or ten, which given the amounts of nudity and violence seems um wildly inappropriate. But I turned out perfectly normal sure keep telling yourself that so before we get into it. Let's chat a bit about the background. So the movie.
