Hello and welcome to Fitness unfiltered episode 64. So this so this is our first in okay a couple of weeks due to some scary scheduling issues. For those of you that I mean did notice they be a large percentage of you that didn't notice but we so did promise that it would be worth the wait. So before we get well into it is only right to acknowledge that I'm also joined by Emma and Mike uh as always so M. How are you I'm fine. Excellent and Mike, how are you? I um am also fine. Okay, so statements of I'm fine pretty much make sure the world goes okay around I think so. We are actually joined by another and we are honored like and excited to be joined by Doctor David. Robert Grimes who is a well physicist cancer researcher award-winning science writer and author of a best-seller, which I'm not just like saying this because he's they're here. I did actually say it to Mike off air as uh well. It is one of my favorite reads of 2019. And the irrational type which we all are irrational apes are times I think so.
