But but then I was told that people may well think that breakfast at Perkins. Could have could have some potential copyright with you know, the actual you know restaurant program, so I might do breakfast with Perkins. I don't know. Anyway, how we doing? well How's everyone doing? I figured I would start a podcast. Maybe to help kind like of supplement my thoughts that I have on other social media platforms whether it be Snapchat um Facebook Instagram. What have what have you first let me apologize. I just ate Indian food and it's like stuck in my throat. First off. Let me give a shout out to India star. You never been to India star.
