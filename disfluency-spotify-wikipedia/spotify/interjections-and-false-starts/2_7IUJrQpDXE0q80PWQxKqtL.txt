Hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about the uh um mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor you know I mean to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too often finding I mean you know that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if we do find so like them then on the other side of the world or is too expensive so uh or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for over 30 you know okay years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've been thinking um uh a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can help more like I mean people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship group here. You'll be um I mean able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You can ask um well me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction um um of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can you can you can be part of this new intimate conversational.
