Hey before hey before we go to this podcast. Let me say a few things about okay the mentorship group as Leaders. We know that we need the wisdom of a mentor you know to help us focus on what matters and avoid costly mistakes yet, too uh often finding that person. We trust and whose experienced is impossible. And then if well we do find them then on the other side of the world or is too um expensive or they just don't have the time. I've been mentoring people now for you know over 30 years in a one-on-one basis and at the start of this year. I've well been thinking a lot about how I can mentor more people how I can well help more people. So I have created an online community called the mentorship okay group here. You'll be able to join me live for monthly group mentorship sessions. You uh can ask me questions anything you like whatever you are in the world for a fraction um of the cost that this would be in. One-to-one mentorship situation. You can be part of this new intimate conversational.
