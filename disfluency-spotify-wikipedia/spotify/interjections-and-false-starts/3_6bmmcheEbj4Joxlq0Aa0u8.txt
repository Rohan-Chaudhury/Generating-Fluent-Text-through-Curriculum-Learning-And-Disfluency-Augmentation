At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a um I mean so Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six okay well well feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on you know so I mean the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice okay uh like a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person okay I mean so who lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out well so um of sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly I mean well um much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This okay okay so was obviously very strange. So the so the so the so the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream okay well okay around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a while. Like well um. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat.
