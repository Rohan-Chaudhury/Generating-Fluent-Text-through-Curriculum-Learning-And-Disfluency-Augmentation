Hey guys, welcome to the first episode of a grain of salt nutrition podcast with well um um well your host me Brett and Cara bullosa. Thank you guys so much for tuning in you know you know I mean like in today's episode. I want to mainly jump into the who what why when and well like so you know how of this podcast. So before you decide to listen to me, let me at least help um I mean like um you understand who I am. I've been an RD for about 5 years now. I've worked okay like you know you know in many different places. I started off at a nursing home from there. I was um I mean so I mean able to go into a clinic Uncle setting working at New York Presbyterian I mean um I mean uh Hospital finally I made it to the Private Practice World, which is really where uh okay you know well I wanted to be I was able to sit with people for longer periods of like well um okay time we set realistic goals, we had follow-ups and we were able to see each well so um you know other for a bit more than five or ten minutes and you're working in the clinical well like uh so setting you're able to squeeze in a couple minutes in between the doctors. The patients I mean okay well okay are really tired at this point because they've been here for a while and then I mean uh well you know I come in and tell them why they can't have salt so it's kind of hard to make.
