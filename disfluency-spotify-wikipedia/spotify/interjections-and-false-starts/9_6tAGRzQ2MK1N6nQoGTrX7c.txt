Welcome to mindful Monday's. This is Angie. And today we're going to be going through um uh so um okay um um I mean I mean a kemetic meditation. So the ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down so um you know you know um I mean well I mean you know on your back with your legs lengthened out arms at your sides. You um I mean like I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean uh can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting you want to so well okay like uh you know okay I mean um make sure that your back is flat up against your chair or a wall if you I mean so you know you know well well like um okay have your legs crossed and if you are sitting in a chair have your um like uh well okay I mean I mean like you know feet Flat on the ground ankles lined up with your knees. So once you find like um so like well I mean um you know I mean either you're sitting or you're laying position with your hands, I want you to find you know I mean like I mean I mean uh I mean okay okay your navel. So with your thumbs identify your navel and then you're going to place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top.
