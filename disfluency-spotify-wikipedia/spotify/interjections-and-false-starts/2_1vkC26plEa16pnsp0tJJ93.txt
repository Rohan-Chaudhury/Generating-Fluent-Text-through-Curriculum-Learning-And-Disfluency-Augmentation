Welcome everyone to the score fantasy football podcast. I'm your I'm your I'm your host Justin you know I mean Boon to leave fantasy Analyst at the score. The NFL combine is over. We're recording this you know so on Monday morning. So at this point we've at least had a couple um so days to digest some of the performances from the skill position players and that's so I mean what we're going to talk about today the offense of risers and fallers from the like so combine. And I know I said this on last week's show but I have to reiterate you uh okay cannot freak out about one data point from the combine. These are Incredibly talented athletes. I you know I mean mean most of the 40-yard dash times. It's just an example, but they're you know uh / like fractions of a second. So that shouldn't make you wildly swinging your you know well view of a player but we did learn some things some players had much better showing I mean like than others. So I so I so I want to go over that stuff today and joining me to talk about.
