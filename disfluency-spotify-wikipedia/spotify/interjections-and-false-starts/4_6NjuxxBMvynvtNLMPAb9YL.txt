Salute up, you know you mentioned about authenticity. But when when I get a you know uh uh um release for me, it's all about the music and I forget Les Mills. I forget the I mean okay like I mean choreography and I don't even think about it being a workout. I just I just I just I just I just listened I mean um um I mean to the songs and I have them on the whole time. Like when like when like when like when like when I mean you know I mean okay I'm in the shower when I'm making food when I'm doing the laundry when you know okay well well I'm training gym, I just try and listen to the music as many times as so so well okay possible, but I'm not even thinking about the lesson was broken all the work out. It's so it's so it's so it's so it's so like um um just filled music and what happens Instruments will pop up or lyrics or stand um I mean I mean you know out all these musical landmarks will come up and you don't know what well well I mean like that's going to be or when it will be but it just happens after uh like well okay you listen to it for a while and then when you actually then well like uh well go right let's plug in and learn the choreography when those two things come together and I mean I mean I mean well you teach your already naturally in the music. So those little moments that so uh well um your son or little hit movement or shoulder wiggle that you just naturally did with the song that just comes out when you.
