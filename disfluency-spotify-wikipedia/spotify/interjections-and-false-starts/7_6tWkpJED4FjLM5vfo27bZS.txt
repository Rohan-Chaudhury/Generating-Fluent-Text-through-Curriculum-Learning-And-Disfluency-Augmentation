The Bachelors women tell all show last night took a surprising turn when Rachel um like well like uh I mean so Lindsay emerged to lead the group and a heartfelt anti-bullying conversation which included her I mean uh so okay uh well I mean reading shockingly racist DMS that I certainly won't be repeating the second was handled like like like well um uh um Tastefully but both fans of the show and alumni are mixed on its inclusion on Reddit like I mean like uh um okay so passionate Bachelor Nation fans think it's completely unreasonable for the show to have so okay you know well um I mean um its cake and eat it too with one trending post led by user and I mean I mean like uh you know uh uh ingenious username saying how the producers run the show creates a Asik environment for bullying well like well well uh um okay and the show taking no accountability for it was crap at no point at The Bachelor so like you know I mean well uh okay show Runners are producers take any accountability for their role in facilitating toxic environments. The okay I mean you know so uh I mean uh show is specifically designed and run around the notion of having a villain. You so okay uh okay you know so uh can't guarantee an engagement or a happily ever after but every single season so uh well uh okay uh like there will be multiple villains. Another user responded digging up Victoria's past infidelity and then you know I mean well you know like I mean like confronting her about it on the women tell all isn't conducive and trying to promote a book.
