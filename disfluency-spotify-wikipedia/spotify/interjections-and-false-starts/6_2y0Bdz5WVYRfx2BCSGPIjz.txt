together growing in Faith Changing communities dear friends we hear in the gospel how well you know like so you know like Jesus after healing the Mother-in-law of Simon Peter how in the following day he gets um uh well like uh well up and he goes to the mountain to pray to be with God to I mean I mean so well okay uh be with the father in prayer. And when you had gone up to be with okay uh um like uh like the father in prayer, he went there to pray and Simon Peter comes to him well well okay well I mean okay and he says to him we've been looking for you and Jesus says while okay you know you know well like like I needed to be with the father but also need to go somewhere well I mean so uh okay I mean else. They something they something they something they something they something they something they something absolutely interesting that I would like us to unpack. It is it is it is it is it is it is it is the attitude of well so um I mean um well Jesus in picking the day. He begins it by being with God the father in you know so you know well well so prayer. He begins it. By taking solace in himself and in the father he wants to.
