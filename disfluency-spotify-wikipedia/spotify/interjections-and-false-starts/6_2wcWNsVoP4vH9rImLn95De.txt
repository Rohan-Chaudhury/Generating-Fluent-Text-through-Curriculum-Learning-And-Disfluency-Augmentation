And yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, uh okay uh I mean uh well I have a coach coaches need coaches and I was talking to my okay uh you know like uh well coach because I had been feeling really stuck in some feelings about parenting and how um like um um like um hard it can be sometimes and I realized I had allowed myself to like uh I mean well I mean like fall into this pattern of just beating myself up in a really unhelpful. You know you know you know you know you know you know you know so like you know um like. A way, which I know better than to do but I just um uh like like you know I mean kind of got caught in a loop and it's one of my weaknesses.
