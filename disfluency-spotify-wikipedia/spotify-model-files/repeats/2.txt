What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about about about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model Model Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really really really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on on on this shout out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for for for this episode. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that that that came out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can can can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which which which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more more more for these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make make make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really really really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as as as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features features features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love love love and the track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
