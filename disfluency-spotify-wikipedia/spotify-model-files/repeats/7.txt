We were just recording recording recording recording recording recording recording recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the the the the the the the the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new new new new new new new new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track track track track track track track track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing.
