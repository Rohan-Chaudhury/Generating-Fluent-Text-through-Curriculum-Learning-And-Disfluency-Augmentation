What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the the the the the the the the the the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a a a a a a a a a a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third third third third third third third third third third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording recording recording recording recording recording recording recording recording recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then then then then then then then then then then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and and and and and and and and and and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track track track track track track track track track track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just just just just just just just just just just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this this this this this this this this this this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort sort sort sort sort sort sort sort sort sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package package package package package package package package package package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
