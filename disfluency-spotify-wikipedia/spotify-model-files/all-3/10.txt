So the title of this podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast podcast is so um okay I mean okay so um um so well called catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch catch open me at the time that I started this podcast. I thought I thought I I I I I I I I I I I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought thought thought thought thought thought thought thought thought thought thought I thought you okay like I mean so like um well well uh so know, what like like like like like like like like like like like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know catch I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean uh so I mean like so uh so um okay up with me sounds like a a a a a a a a a a a good title. But then as I recorded the past you know okay um I I I I I I I I I I I mean I mean like uh like okay um few episodes, I've noticed something something something something something something something something something something something I started to figure out what the theme of this like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh okay like like so okay okay well well podcast should be. So if you you you you you you you you you you you know notice a lot of the things that we like I mean you know know know know know know know know know know know like okay so um well I mean so covered from the past few episode episode episode episode episode episode episode episode episode episode episode is about mental health growing up and I mean I mean so so okay so so so so so so so so so so so uh well well I mean things we deal with as a teenager or as a a a a a a a a a a a young adult. So with that said uh so I mean okay you know um I mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean mean so you know okay the new title of the podcast will be basically growing growing growing growing growing growing growing growing growing growing growing up. I finally figure out what like well well uh um you know uh I I I I I I I I I I I mean okay like the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up up up up up up up up up up up is going to be so so okay um okay okay so uh you know know know know know know know know know know know I mean having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them share what they think think think think think think think think think think think okay I mean so um well uh you know uh so you know is important for for for for for for for for for for for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.

So tune out if you want so well I mean um you know I I I I I I I I I I I mean like well you know um to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season season season season season season season season season season season couple weeks ago.
