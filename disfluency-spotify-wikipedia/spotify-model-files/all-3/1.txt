What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about about the gross uh margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model Model S and so plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm I'm really really excited about you know from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out out on this shout out to so the third row podcast. I came up the idea for for this episode. We were well just recording and we're talking about this new track package package that came out for okay the model 3. It's like it's like a a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool uh looking new tire tire. Hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand um and then then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these uh brake brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's okay gotten gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing.
