Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears. Well from hard work grows over time proverbs. I read a story recently about a year old who went to visit a financial planner the financial planner asked to see her spending habits the author of the article shared that over the phone sessions in a couple of weeks of financial reflection. She found that she did n't have to give up things. She really loved to save money that realization helped her get past financial anxiety and helped her to make productive spending cuts during the sessions. Which each lasted about an hour they discussed her background shared screens to look at a monthly credit card statement and addressed goals for the week. The financial accountability was intended to help her prepare and save for the future. It 's encouraging to know that the bible is full of wise advice on how to handle and how to view money in fact money is mentioned hundreds of times in the bible including the verse from proverbs we heard today. Let 's hear it again wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears. Well from hard work grows over time. It 's also important to remember.

What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We 're going to talk about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the plaid mode model s and plasmid model x on tesla by this is something i 'm really really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and we 're talking about this new track package that came out for the model. It 's like a upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your performance model which already cost grand and then you pay five and a half grand more for these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It 's gotten some awesome reviews. So that 's a really cool thing. And i was just thinking like wow there 's so much opportunity for tesla as sort of this luxury performance brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of die hard fans and like tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example but what i think is an even bigger example of this trend and what 's really going to happen in late.

This is your everyday positivity here on vale. Hello I 'm kate crocker. I hope you 're well today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough i had a moment this week with my coach about accountability and i was really surprised. It 's always really surprising when you think i 've got that bit sorted and i 'm always really good at that and then someone asks you a question and you go always like that. I think i 'm good at that or the time actually good at that so i have been challenged this week and it 's hard. It 's hard pushing yourself through those challenges. It feels uncomfortable you get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and your instinct says right. I need to move away from this. I do n't want to go there t harv eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets easy when you do the hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard stuff. So something is really challenging you at the moment take it on and know that when you come out the other side.
