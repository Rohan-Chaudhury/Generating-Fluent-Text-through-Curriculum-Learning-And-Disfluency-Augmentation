What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the gross margin you know uh you know uh well impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid model X I mean well so I mean well on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a financial so I mean I mean well so perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third row you know okay um you know okay podcast. I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and we're talking I mean so so so like about this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's like a well so well you know well $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for your I mean uh okay so um performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a I mean you know you know so uh half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads which are okay like so well um geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews uh well okay um like. So that's a really cool thing. And I was just thinking like wow, uh well well um I mean there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all okay okay I mean um well of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like um like well uh so Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what I okay um uh like um think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.
