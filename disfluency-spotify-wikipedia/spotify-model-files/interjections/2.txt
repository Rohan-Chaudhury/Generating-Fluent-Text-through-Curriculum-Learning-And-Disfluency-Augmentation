What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the gross well well margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and uh like plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about I mean well from a financial perspective.

Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be so so explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become uh uh more masculine to determine your fate.
