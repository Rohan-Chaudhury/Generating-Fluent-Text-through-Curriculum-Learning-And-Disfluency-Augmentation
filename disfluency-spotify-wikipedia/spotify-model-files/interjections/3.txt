What a paper change welcome to another episode today.

So going to nerd out on this shout out to well okay well the third row podcast. I came up the idea for this episode you know like so. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came okay okay um out for the model 3. It's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get you know I mean well these really cool looking new tire.
