What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about well so well so okay you know okay the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and like okay you know uh I mean you know like plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about like you know uh okay okay um so from a financial perspective.

We okay I mean like uh so you know I mean were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out well you know well you know I mean okay like for the model 3.
