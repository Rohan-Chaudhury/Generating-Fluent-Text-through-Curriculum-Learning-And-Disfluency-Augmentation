Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears. Well from hard work grows over time Proverbs 13 11. I read a story recently about a 24 year old who went to visit a financial planner the financial planner asked to see her spending habits the author of the article shared that through to over the phone sessions in a couple of weeks of financial reflection. She found that she didn't have to give up things. She really loved to save money that realization helped her get past Financial anxiety and helped her to make productive spending cuts during the sessions. Which each lasted about an hour they discussed her background shared screens to look at a monthly credit card statement and addressed goals for the week. The financial accountability was intended to help her prepare and save for the future. It's encouraging to know that the Bible is full of wise advice on how to handle and how to view Money In fact money is mentioned hundreds of times in the Bible including the verse from Proverbs we heard today. Let's hear it again wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears. Well from hard work grows over time. It's also it's also it's also it's also it's also it's also it's also it's also it's also it's also important to remember.

We'll figure it out. I don't know. Hi, I'm Christina. I'm Tim, this is our podcast is first time something new just you know had an idea one day like hey, you know, we do have a lot of talks and sometimes we're going to like deep talking.

What a paper change welcome to another episode today. We're going to talk about the gross margin impact of a successful launch of the Plaid mode Model S and plasmid model X on Tesla by this is something I'm really really excited about from a financial perspective. So going to nerd out on this shout out to the third row podcast. I came I came I came I came I came I came I came I came I came I came up the idea for this episode. We were just recording and we're talking about this new track package that came out for the model 3. It's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like a $5,500 upgrade where you can basically get these really cool looking new tire. Hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for hours for your performance model 3 which already cost 60 Grand and then you pay five and a half Grand more for these new tires and these brake pads which are geared to make it perform better on the track. It's gotten some awesome reviews. So that's a really cool thing. And I and I and I and I and I and I and I and I and I and I was just thinking like wow, there's so much opportunity for Tesla as sort of this luxury Performance Brand to upsell all of these fancy new features and services that sort of Die Hard fans and like Tesla nerds would love and the track package is one example, but what I think is an even bigger example of this trend and what's really going to happen in late 2012.

Is arranged marriage a scary proposition last year three of my friends had terrible experiences involving arranged marriage in the first experience. The two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two parties are engaged and right before the wedding the girl told him that she loves somebody else in the second experience as a wedding date approached the girl ran away with her boyfriend in the third experience the two parties got married, but within a month my friend found out that she was still in touch with her ex-boyfriend and probably had an affair and asked he filed for divorce right away. Such experience has made me wonder what are the reasons that make people go for an arranged matters on man.
Uncle Si back in the office and in today's video, I'm going to be explaining to each and every single male out there specifically how to become more masculine to determine your fate. And the reason why I feel that this is such an important topic is because people have no idea nowadays how to actually control their Destiny or how to actually control their fate so that way they're in control of what they would like and as a man this is important to your success. This is ridiculously important to your happiness. And not and not and not and not and not and not and not and not and not and not only that if you want to become a man of value so that way other men or other people in general can lean on you. You're going to have to learn this. So here's the deal. If you if you if you if you if you if you if you if you if you if you don't have a very high attention span, if you're a person who cannot sit there and focus for two to five minutes, you're not going to do very well.

I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought you know, what like catching up with friends. Just talking about random stuff, you know catch up with me sounds like a good title. But then but then but then but then but then but then but then but then but then but then as I recorded the past few episodes, I've noticed something I started to figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So if so if so if so if so if so if so if so if so if so if you know notice a lot of the things that we covered from the past few episode is about mental health growing up and things we deal with as a teenager or as a young adult. So with that said the new title of the podcast will be basically growing up. I finally figure out what the theme of this podcast should be. So basically growing up is going to be having guess hopping onto the podcast and basically having them share what they think is important for us teenagers and young adults to know what it's like going up on their side.

Spoiler alert, I'm doing some definite speculating on today's show. So tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune so tune out if you want to stay spoiler-free on Bachelor this season couple weeks ago. I reported I reported I reported I reported I reported I reported I reported I reported I reported I reported that Madison Pruitt with seen in Auburn filming something with a production crew Link in the description and I along with almost all of Bachelor Nation speculated that Maddie was certainly going to be 2020s Bachelorette. Well that theory is officially dead because Claire Crawley was announced as next season's leading woman. So let me get this straight. Maddie was filming something weeks after production wrapped, but she's not the Bachelorette so she has to be the winner of this season, right? Is there any other reason Maddie would have been filming this is unconfirmed. But as of right now I see no other explanation unless y'all have other theories. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. That's all I've got for today on Bachelor News Daily. But if you're new to Clare Crawley, I just did a deep dive on her earlier today. So check that out on this channel and make sure you check out our Bachelor after show live tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific on AfterBuzz TV. I've been your host chef Graham. Thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for thanks for tuning into Bachelor News Daily.
