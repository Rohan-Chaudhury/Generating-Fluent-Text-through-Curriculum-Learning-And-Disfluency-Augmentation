I have a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening
looking back maybe some of the things that I know now I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about because we never went to war I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out and I feel like it went on and on
and I guess I see such a contrast as opposed to the middle east war we just had where president bush went out and got worldwide support for what was happening
I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and I'm not sure that's our role but
I agree with that I was fairly young at the time too I really don't have very many memories about it at all in fact
and my husband is a vietnam veteran and in looking at the persian gulf war that just went on he it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time? I do think that it's been too long in coming but I feel like maybe the american people and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support those
so many people were opposed to the war what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it and those guys were there doing their duty
that's right they weren't there by choice and and I think that we learned from that and I think it's one of those things that you learn the hard way it was a tragic mistake
the way that they have been treated over the years and I believe that's just now turning around just now trying to be rectified and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people
I don't think you can and I agree with you that I think that the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in every aspect of it and I agree with you also that I feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war they're still not settled over there they're not
and I have a feeling that the persian gulf crisis is going to be the same way
I think we're going to end up back there in a few years if not sooner I appreciate the I feel like president bush is in a hard spot he went over there to get them out of kuwait which he did
and then he has backed out he has pulled out and I realize they're still saying you're encouraging us to get rid of saddam hussein so why aren't you helping us? and I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another vietnam situation I think it would too and I don't think the u s will stand for it I don't think he would do that
I think we learned too much of the effects
I agree with that whether it was justified or not I know that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and beat the communism
but I think somewhere that got lost in the long term effects of the war and
you have to give bush a lot of credit for he said that's what we were going there to do and he did what he said and he did pull out before it got any further than that where it would have turned into more of a police action or more of a political action you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as another country
my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address that we don't get fixed that's right I know
and that's what frustrates me more than anything and I believe that we have to have a military and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us
but I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward
I think there's a lot of waste and they don't if they could just cut out all the fat and get it lean and start addressing some of the other issues I think we could take care of everything and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world who just end up using things against us later on anyway
I know I do think that in the middle east war I think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that were so hateful towards the united states have come away with kind of a different attitude
I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more
and I think that's good
I think that's a good
a lot of good has come from this one I think so too
and I guess in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the vietnam war toward this war because we said earlier that a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of that war and and perhaps the reason that good came out of the mid east war is because we had the experience of vietnam
so I do think that we've learned from it
I wish there weren't war
no kidding but I do think we learned
and I just hate the emotional price a lot of the vietnam people paid for nothing
they still don't know what they were there for there was no feeling of accomplishment no goal
we went in but what did we do we lost lives and what were we trying to do who knows
that's true and I think you're right I think you're right there I do remember when it was over I remember when they were coming home but I remember the feeling back then right now I feel like this country has been behind this war
there's a lot of people that aren't for war I'm not for war
but I believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right I don't remember that feeling back in vietnam
I just remember our guys are over there and it's sad and we shouldn't be fighting a war but there was no let's support them
the when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and all the demonstrations that were going on
I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity because those kind of people they're the kind of people who've always got to have a cause whether it's good bad of indifferent they've got to have a cause and nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're supporting the war that's right that's right you have to support the people that are there that's right and for some reason those people don't see that they don't see it as supporting the folks the people
they don't and they're just real shallow people I would agree with you there
I agree and I recall when president bush said that he said look I'm sorry that you're opposed to the war there's a lot of us that are opposed to war but you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing and I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that but
they're not helping anybody that's the whole point not they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves that's true
and I don't even know what they're doing for themselves giving a soapbox to stand on
but I'm glad we've learned I'm sorry we had the experience of vietnam
and I'm especially sorry for the people that have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally because until the past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that for them that's true
and I think that's where we as american people really failed them
I don't know do you have anything else you want to say on this?
I guess not I think this is the first time that I haven't been cut off by the computer I know we get cut off all the time too usually I can talk all day but this is something to me that's sad
it is have a good day and I appreciate the conversation same here
what kind of camping is there in texas? there are quite a few state parks and there's a couple of national parks that you can camp at
most of them have pretty good facilities I don't know if the camping that I've done is really roughing it without a whole lot of stuff
you do backpacking and the like? done a little bit of that mainly just camping out at the state parks I've been to a couple in texas and there's some real nice ones in arkansas
I think arkansas has one of the best parks departments around
is the ozarks in arkansas? part of them are
so that's probably a pretty nice place to go they've got real nice lake system around their parks one of them the gray it's real nice there a bunch of lakes around it there's a golf course and just a whole bunch of camping sites
what about you where have you
I've been camping for years not on a regular basis but I first started camping out in the desert in california and then sometimes in the mountains also in california
and then I moved to north carolina and I didn't camp for a long time and then I started to go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting so I'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting
and then maybe camp another night and drive home and that was pretty good so I went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear and I still do it once in a while I think we've collected stuff off and on over the years the more times we did it the more serious we get about it
where is raleigh in north carolina?
in terms of north south I would say it's a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it so what are you kind of away from the blue ridge mountains it's an area
the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh they're about three hours away if you go due north
of the blue ridge in north carolina are much nicer and you can pick those up going west but then you're talking about six to eight hours
the way it works but it's a real nice place to go and camp and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although I don't think the state of north carolina takes they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might my wife's from the western part of virginia we've been down the parkway a lot but I didn't know how much camping areas there were along there
I think there's quite a few I can't say I've checked them all out though what's it like camping in the desert and california that seems like a challenge
it's actually kind of incredible
it's really really nice I like it better than almost anything I've ever done just the sky is so amazing you really can probably count thousands of stars
and it's just kind of nice I like the I think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which a lot of people don't realize they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry and lack of water course it has all of those qualities but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert
so it's pretty nice the movie the doors has some nice desert scenes those guys all go camping out in the desert
of course they drag a lot of drugs with them but the shots are pretty nice and it's sort of like that it's just almost surreal in some places
it's very pleasant are the temperatures real extreme there or the
they can be you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen
I've been camping in death valley one doesn't go in july
but it's beautiful in february
it's just beautiful the days get up into the high eighties maybe the nineties but it's quite bearable and then the nights are reasonably warm sixties or seventies it's just great it's really very nice we've talked about planning a trip up through I have a sister in law that lives up through new mexico and into colorado and the grand canyon area I don't know when I'm going to get a chance to do that but
that would be pretty nice I have been camping on the south rim the grand canyon that's okay a lot of people like to go down and camp down inside I was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking especially with my gear
I'll bet that one thing you said about the stars is really true it's when you're close to a big city like dallas the lights kind of wash off the star
so it's nice to get away it's just amazing how much you miss it
it it really is I don't think I ever see the little dipper you hear people talk about the little dipper
but I don't think I ever see it except when I go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in the mountains otherwise it's just too faint I guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject
I think we fulfilled our obligation thanks for calling nice talking to you it was good talking to you robert
I guess we're supposed to discuss the school system that shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us?
as many years as we've been involved in one I really feel fortunate in that even though there are problems they're not a lot of problems where I teach
but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems with dropouts when I was in minnesota last summer there was a teacher who said that on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up
and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city minneapolis
and they just didn't come to school that's really sad isn't it?
and I can not imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school just recently in the paper here were articles about students working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades
but then the follow up the next day was I was kind of glad to see because it said that but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that handling a job was very possible and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors
I think so too what are their plans after high school and what's their home situation you know that the home is the key I think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education
and the main goal is making money now and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand
but there can still be an attitude of
this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but that the most important thing is still getting your education your education
when they said the topic of what's wrong with the public schools my first impulse was it isn't really what's wrong with the public schools it's what's wrong with families that's right
it's what's wrong with families and if children come to school insecure and their biggest concern is survival both at home and society in general
they don't know what to expect at home they don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex
for example that child that was shot
how can they concentrate on schooling? I agree with you
I think that's the main problem
and schools now are supposed to solve social problems mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security
and that's overwhelming at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor and that's just really not enough
it isn't and I was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are at a tougher and rougher age and all that but part of my feeling is that if you help them to work through their problems while they're littler then they won't have as many problems up there
I think there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary
we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and they divided them up between three counselors but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work
they started dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees through all three years of middle school they do that here
and I think that would give them more security in going to the counselor
if they have a rapport with their counselor if they don't I hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them to change
and occasionally that happens
but it is frightening because education is the key to our future it certainly is
and if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another then what are we going to do with them? that's right
what's going to happen to them? are they going to be able to work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison
and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them
that's no good I'm on that campus strategic planning committee for my school
and one of the they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that we believed that the public education is the best economic value then I think they decided to strike economic
anyway the point was what happens when public education fails? will then people go to private schools?
what kind of a situation do they get there and what are and what kind of state are we in if most people are going to private schools
I think one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody
there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone that's right that's right
we're the only country in the world that does
and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing to work and have some ability
they can do that and one of the plano school district's goals is that they will graduate every child that is here in the ninth grade I believe it's something like that
it's worded and I don't know
if we can keep them in school that's so important
then that helps a lot
I think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too that new movie out
it's scary to me I really a frightening situation
we are I guess we're both lucky to be in situations and schools where we don't see that
my folks talk about it a lot in illinois my mother was teacher for years and years and they live in peoria illinois and they're talking a lot about the school situation there too shall we wrap it up?
I would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary I think we have to
so I'll see you when we see you
we were in austin yesterday the reason that I wasn't at church and we went to hear james wind ensemble concert
they left this morning for england
how exciting isn't that wonderful? that is wonderful
what an experience and the university
kathleen do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system?
I certainly do I think we have a lousy school system and what do you think that problem is?
and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents and then we put too much responsibility on the teachers for things that are really not education
they're social services that seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before
as a matter of fact I just finished editing a book on the topic so I have some rather strong opinions that's interesting do you yourself
and I'm sure they're colored by what I've edited do youself have children who are or have been through the public school system?
I do and I was not very happy with the results I see so if you were to improve it what would you do to improve it?
I think I would start with getting rid of about two thirds of the administrators and all the auxiliary personnel the school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself
and then I would use the money that we've paying them to provide some special help in training and particularly mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time
and then let them try some innovative things and see what works and then have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things and then from the parents side have the parents support the school get involved
pay attention to what's happening talk to the teachers talk to their kids about school and support the institution and instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the teacher's in the middle that's some pretty good ideas why don't you do something with those?
I've done about all I can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people you should run for a school board position
that I'm not so sure about I've got a lot of things to keep me busy that
have you done anything like that? anything political? my mother was on the school board as we were coming up
and that basically is the extent to which our family has been directly they've always been involved my parents through the p t a organization and my mother was on the school board for eight years
but I guess that's more than some people less than others
that's more than a lot I would tend to agree with you that there is a problem the methods of correcting it I haven't thought through quite to the detail which you have but I believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher
and if there was a way to set that image to be a little higher esteem a little more prestige to being a teacher and with that of course you have to pay them accordingly if we paid them more it would attract more the higher educated people to either move into that field or to continue in that field
and then if you paid them more you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them
I think that's absolutely right they the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job instead of getting the improvement that we want
so we'd have to have some way to reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones
it's hard to tell so it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one other than how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class if there's some gauge that they could make
also I've thought about the idea of making teaching and the before you can get a certificate you have a certain residency period much like a doctor maybe not the four years definitely but some certain type of position where you're overseen to begin with
that's a very good suggestion just something to rather than throw someone into that environment it
I don't think student teaching is enough I thought that maybe something
I think that at least what I used to observe in student teaching was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher
and then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks
so there really was no time to try much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the student teacher improve very much
there are lots of things that could be done in that line including things like video taping because it wouldn't be hard with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to video tape either a master teacher teaching a class so that then students could watch that and criticize the methods used and analyze it figure out what worked and what didn't work
and then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance that's good as a teaching aid but more you see these commercials that have jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in new york while jimmy's in rome
and the whole electronic classroom idea
I don't know if I'm in favor of
I don't think that's going to work I think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to learn how to learn
another thing I think would be helpful would be to have some sort of a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in texas and california and then everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach is that because that's where the two biggest markets are because it or?
that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis I see
and so it I used to work for a textbook publisher and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by texas then you had a built in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts
and a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks
and then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids just have to follow along and take what texas gets
california is the biggest for elementary schools but texas adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade I see definitely is a national problem that they need to address
sure is definitely is
and I hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with reagan's new education secretary trying to produce some new programs anyway
excuse me I've enjoyed speaking with you
I have got to go I've got another line calling what are you guys having for christmas?
what are we having? let's see I'm not planning the menu you're not
we usually go out to either one of our folks they both live close to
but I don't know it seems like a big thing for christmas is usually ham funny you should mention that I'm a pig farmer you are
it's kind of a hobby more than anything else but we're going to have wild boar
we killed a boar the other day it was mating with the sows and you can't use the piglets so
it's about six months of no use so we shot him and cleaned him out and had him processed into ham and we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because I've got one that's got a hernia
and rather than pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him
is that hard? I tell you what preparing a little pig is a snap I'm telling you real easy easier than chicken
you just you kill him you probably most guys just shoot them in the head they go in a second they're gone
and then you just dip the carcass in boiling water pull it out and gut it and just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and some pineapple about three pineapples and cover him up with wet sacks and then start a charcoal fire on top of him
and after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there and it's the best eating you ever had
does a boar taste just like regular ham? just like a pig
does it it has a lot less fat
this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds
and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds
we took the skin and the head and the feet off and that was about a hundred pounds of just ham
how many people are you planning on serving at christmas? we're not going to eat the whole thing
eat it all it would take a year but we're going to drive up to kansas city see my wife's folks and she what's your mother cooking for christmas her mom's doing brisket I don't what is brisket? brisket? it's a part of the cow that they used to throw away
it's just tough as a boot
and they used to use it for leather I think I was kidding
but it's a part of the loin the rib cage and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs
so it's really a tough piece of meat
but it's so tasty you can't stand it
so you just take it and you marinate it for a couple of days
and that softens it up
and then you just put it in the oven takes about four hours to cook one they weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds
and we're going to have that
what else do you serve with your pig? we'll have cranberries and hominy and we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here
we have black olives and cucumbers and tomatoes we still have tomatoes
do you? fresh tomatoes
we just got lots of snow it started to freeze up around here there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire and half of that's down it's thirty degrees this morning
but it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost
I didn't know it got that low at night it's desert where we are it's the edge of the desert it's part of the great plains so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred hundred and ten
and at night it goes down to about sixty
we get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours
so everything that lives around here is real tough
that's trees we got hundred year old trees that are twenty feet tall
that's all the bigger they get they're just hard as a rock
what is your view do you consider the soviet union a threat?
I don't know that it's so much a military threat anymore as a it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a threat it is I guess
it takes awhile to get used to something if the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not what they used to be
it's hard to know anymore if it's a threat one way or another because it used to be so much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell rank and file in behind it
and now that with gorbachev is introducing more freedoms or expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though everybody's following the same pattern
and the people who are the staunch military conservative people you never know gorbachev's future is whereas in the past it was seen as whoever was the head of the communist party was seen as untouchable
I the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so dramatic that you almost think wait a minute we're getting stuck into something here if somebody's about to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore
and I'd like to think that that isn't true but I the evidence is that he's let some stuff go the east german situation
it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible if I'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book I said that couldn't have happened that way
it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on both economies that our economy is of course been able to withstand that a little better
but the russian economy they I don't know what the percentages are but I heard it one time it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine
and finally who knows maybe they're finally waking up and saying we can't afford this the u s isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be even if they're saying that beneath the doors
but it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period
even if it is the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is
I think what I'd have to I guess to answer the question directly I'm still just a little bit leery of the whole thing
what I haven't seen is a great stepping back in the military situation
it's one thing to let us go ahead and sort of disarm and I even had a thought once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a deal to go ahead and let us expend some military hardware expend?
of course it didn't turn out that way
and that may have been a kind of far out way of thinking about it I don't know it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy that was here twenty years ago
but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do have not been world powers so it's easier for us to say to an iraq you can't do this get back or we're going to force you
or we can do something about it whereas if the soviet union would have who knows what taking over mongolia or something like that who is really will we have been more just rhetoric rather than going in there officially or physically and try to remove them
the china situation when it looked like that thing was turning around and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the red square or wherever said okay and that's enough
and the tanks came in and pretty much took care of that
and that personally I don't see gorbachev as being maybe a threat and I think he's actually honestly trying to do some change
but I don't believe that he in this first pass around being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either
this would be like if somebody was elected president of the united states and suddenly took off toward just some pretty hard by the socialism
and the reaction the economic the social structure of the soviet union it's coming apart at the seams
and I've heard people say it's just like the american civil war will there be a union or not? it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole soviet system was put together under total force there was no as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it
nobody a lot those people didn't vote to become part of the soviet union they had no choice that was always kind of interesting people a lot of my friends have taken us down the stance of these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away and I'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic if I'm a soviet and if part of south south dakota wanted to succeed am I going to stand for that
I realize that the origins are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with and that they may have been forced I'm not that familiar with their future
but I it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than a volunteer or willingness to join but
the whole thing was put together by force there's no real question about that
and some of the countries that were forced in at later dates is the three baltic countries came in the forties
and it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the germans and then just never given back
and then the russians even took it back from the germans and never bothered to give it back
so that's a little different situation that whole a
the whole idea if you look at the russian history and all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer
and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers and maybe countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you you can I guess israel is a perfect example
the reason they have the angolan heights all their buffer area is between jordan and the sinai and lebanon was just as a buffer but as you can see the scuds go right over there
they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers there's very little that binds you anymore in today's technology I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over germany and they're going to land in other places
that's going to be the safest place to be that's probably very true that's very interesting never thought of that
I guess what they'd have to do to I really don't know in the I hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears
some reason or other is it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say wait a minute nobody knows what to do
what's really happening here is it real?
but you wonder how well this thing who was it boris yeltsin evidently was elected president of the soviet for the russian republic which is the biggest
I get confused between which is the soviet provinces versus which are the russian provinces versus what are
in the center but you got the great big area that was traditionally known as russia and then all these little nationality groups around it that were was there nineteen of them or whatever
and these were all the soviet economists they had some real fancy names for them
matter of fact when the what I read when the united nations was setup in san francisco one of the first things the russians wanted to do was bring in each one of these republics as a separate country as a
so there would be nineteen rather than one as a vote
and the united states said that mean we get to bring in forty eight
and that sort of they backed down on that died down on that I thought it was interesting that recently here the warsaw pact no longer exists as a military force but it's merely an economic now wonder if that at
what do you get shot by something that's called an economic force or what is called a military pact
it's all you can change the name of something but I wonder if it's still exists
although I've seen some evidence that the russian soldiers are you the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because they're having housing shortages now what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by bulgaria and czechoslovakia and all the
and now all of a sudden they're going home and somebody's got to pay for their that's what they're saying the whole problem with if we were to demilitarize europe what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there?
that's not what's going to happen to the economies that no longer have a million plus people in each country from the u s
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago
they've statewide raises they raise ours constantly we just passed a new one fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the united airlines indianapolis got that didn't they?
and we had passed a provisional one that if they did locate here we would raise our taxes but at least we thought we'd get something back from that
how do you feel about taxes? it seems like a big politics game up here last year the governor was up for re election so he said the budget was fine the state didn't have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes and now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them
so they're just talk about lowering them but they never do they just keep raising them
I've never seen taxes really go down me neither actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year and they're going to lower it for next year
I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget
I hope they put that in writing they say they're going to lower but I'll see
I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor can't afford it either but I really feel like and I feel like I'm a middle class person income wise anyway and I get tired of supporting the whole country so do I I'm middle class barely but I don't think the rich are paying not enough I think they're paying too much
you think the rich are paying too much? if you're in the three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month that's ridiculous why bother working?
I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to I'm talking about the really rich they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make that would be fair
I'll go along with that no loopholes or anything everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever
I think that would be fair
and I no ifs ands and buts no big elaborate laws that call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review it's just you make this you pay ten percent if you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent that's the way our state tax is here I think it's pretty fair
our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal
and they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate
and you withhold no matter what you do they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out
so now when you sign your w two whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state which is ridiculous
but it's been that way for the last probably ten years I guess you have to check yes or you come down to the end of the year and you don't have it to give it to them
unless you have a lot of deductions
but if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you state wise
and you end up owing you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state
and it's just ridiculous but I don't know I've they just came up with a twenty five percent increase on personal property in oklahoma county and that is a chunk I'll say I mean twenty five percent increase is
I work at t I and we have of course started random drug testing here and I haven't gotten called yet but I feel that it's pretty good if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs
do they feel that way? I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at t I but I think our latest statistic said something like ninety nine point nine eight percent were testing negative on all the testing
I think it's a good idea just because I'm opposed to the drugs
I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it
it's I don't know I don't really liken it to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too
so I think it's a good idea and I think just the idea that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're
I don't know that their job would be at risk because I think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs
I would think that is that how they do it at t I maybe that I at t I if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program and you go through the program and then you're called six months after you complete the program
and if you test positive then you're terminated
I guess I draw a hard line but I'm in favor of that type of thing that you have people out there that are responsible for certain things
and you expect them to do their job and it is possible that they can't do as good a job as they might do that's right
and of course they can also cause injury to other people
if they're not fully functional mentally while they're doing their job they could cause serious injury to another people and you never know
they could just go off the deep end on something whatever they're taking at the time
and it would be out of the question
also I guess you can get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or whatever all kinds that's right
I sub in the schools
so I've had a they talk a lot about drugs there
and I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools
but I think they can test all they want for drugs and if they need to do that as a condition for employment
and I know many of them are doing it I know my son has had to do it for both sam's and wal mart
and I don't know how many others are doing that and I think that's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age that's right
and I don't know it's just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle I think
I think personally I'm for it there's several reason why I could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it and
it's that high? and it's very expensive and
I didn't realize it was that expensive it's not like a normal urinalysis
it's very expensive to run them and I didn't get a raise this year because nobody in our company got a raise
but yet they spend all the money on drug testing
just lucky to have jobs and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise so there's different I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a we should have drug testing because there's really a problem
and I know that but then I have other views to it
I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period
and sam's and wal mart are owned by the same people
he took one for wal mart for job hiring
and then sam's called him and he took another one
and I don't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together
I can see if because if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted theirs might not run a thousand dollars our from what I understanding here at t I they run close to a thousand dollars an employee
maybe they run I don't know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health type program that it would catch a lot of things
I just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them but for all the it's how you doing? not bad not bad what's your name? fernando fernando my name is nick wait let me turn off my stereo here
because I've been waiting for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody
I'm what time is it over are you in dallas?
I'm in detroit or not detroit I'm in california are you?
I because every time I got through I went to dallas texas
I'm in north carolina
you're on the let's see on the other coast
twenty one it's midnight almost? what? it's I'm watching saturday night live here
I guess we're supposed to talk what about credit card? wait how did you get to know about the t I thing?
one of my instructors said that they were doing something like this and what are you working on?
a masters in information systems I'm doing my masters in computer science and computer engineering
where at? at north carolina state university
how do you like it out there? I don't because I come from a bigger city than this one and I'm in raleigh and
raleigh durham that area and it's really small all you have is towns built around universities like chapel hill?
so it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they don't have a whole lot there where you at?
I'm in monterey california right now it's like this town probably has two hundred and fifty thousand people and that's about it two hundred fifty?
it's a lot bigger than monterey is but we're just south of san jose and san francisco
and it's only a hour away to a large city where do you go? do you go to berkeley?
it's the naval postgraduate school out here because I was looking at the doctorate degree in computer science center at berkeley
and they're asking for a g p a of three point seven or something like that
and they're looking for g r e like ninety nine percentile and this and that and it's like
that's what they look for whether or not they get it is hard to say I know that's why I didn't apply for me it was practically impossible to get between ninety and ninety nine percentile on the verbal part
it's pretty tough it's pretty tough I let's face it and I did the as far as I found it a lot of times with regards to education the school only takes you so far it's what you do
so I don't lose any sleep over stuff like that are you going to go for your doctorate?
probably not I'm in the navy
and most of the navy funds that I probably won't do it until I if I do do it it will be after I get out of the navy when do you get out?
probably be another twelve years
I like what I'm doing right now but what if they pay for it? excuse me? what if they pay for?
if they pay for a p h d?
they won't pay for it I think they have maybe two people a year go get their p h d because I know a couple of people here that work for the army
they civilians or military? I think they're military but the guy is still in
and he works over in maryland
and so he's doing his masters here they gave him a scholarship for a year
and he's doing it in a year and a summer
and so he's getting that and they said they got a lot of benefits and that
that's why you want to join
but this guy you can earn a lot more money so you say I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your masters
they go they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so
a lot of times it's not the money that keeps people in
they like what they're doing they feel good about what they're doing that type of thing it's more but you the once you get your masters you can be earning anywhere between thirty seven forty five thousand a year
and that's not what they're paying easily I'm sure
it depends on what rank you are of course I know
like I say if you're at an upper level in the rank category you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year but that's
those are few and far between though it's in I b m in I b m you can get certain points
and everyone's a manager but nobody can get one more point to become whatever you need to earn so much money
since I imagine it's fairly competitive it's I b m is there's a joke about I b m which says it's all the major companies get into a boating race
and so I b m says we have to have a team
and then they come in last and they have this whole team analyze why they came in last because the person asked for it
saying he goes the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing
so he goes have you come up with a solution? they go yeah change the rower it's like everyone's a manager
but it's like one person does the work so
too many chiefs and not enough indians so
I don't know that can really slow you down that's the way it works that's why they're having problems everyone's a manager and
I didn't realize that it's like the people that actually do the work there are very few
and then the other people just plan it it's like have you ever seen the commercial for federal express with the think tank push paper around
all these people are just sitting around just going what shall we do? has anybody thought of anything?
and then this guy from federal express comes along they go what's that? this track which it's going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
and so it's the same thing with I b m so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but the thing is that I b m is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff
they've got basically a lock on a lot of the market
and a lot of times you figure with the support that they provide people generally go with that because they figure that you probably won't get fired for getting I b m material whereas if you try something different they'll say yeah and it fails and you're dead
why didn't you try something more mainline I b m doesn't fire anybody because what they do is they put you in a different job which you actually are sitting around not doing anything so you quit
that's their policy they never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally
illegal or something like that if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
but they won't let you off what they'll do is suppose you're a manager so they'll put you into keeping up the paper
it's how much paper is going in? and then you say that's not my job so you quit
so in other words that's the way they force people out
that's why they can say there's no layoff policy
but they don't really say that you're always going to have great career conditions
that's kind of sad but it's like they have just different policy I don't know my dad works for them but it's like in their commercials they never put down any other company it's like they won't say
they're the standard right now or as far as that goes people think of computers they think of I b m a lot of times and the main because what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it
and so that's what you're going to go for
that's a big thing and it's for example like leading edge have you ever heard of leading edge?
they are out of korea what?
leading edge don't they they made small personal computers
small p c s they're out of korea I don't know I don't know but what they did is buy all the parts that I b m would throw away and build an I b m p c with all the parts that I b m would throw away for example you test a chip it can't last seven years but it can last five I b m says let's throw it away leading edge will say we'll buy it from you
and so that's they're still around I think
I've seen them around anyway so that's what they do they buy all the things that I b m throws away and that's why they're so compatible because
and by the time you have computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway
most people do or they have to anyway there's in a way you realize one of my teachers got this computer which it's voice synthesizing stuff
and he got that he said it's like I was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory
and I want more and it's jesus christ it's why do you want more because it's one second of recording you put into wave
and you want to correct the errors into wave it takes so much it's like of course it does by the times it transforms into wave by mark off model and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you're trying to make the wave smooth so you can approximately of course it's going to take a lot imagine what it is for us to make mark off models
it's amazing it's jesus christ
when you get right down to it the more they can do for you the more memory they're going to require
both in terms in ram as well as standard memory or disk base
so like they say nobody can get enough it's like once you have something and it's like
you find out more I was watching this program on t v yesterday in nineteen seventy six nasa came up with three d graphics
and they were showing this three d graphics view of
like the deal? what?
like a hologram? this is like video game stuff
with just graphics on a
but the only thing was that it was just lines if you
I pay a good deal of taxes because I make a fair amount of money and the taxes that I pay as a general statement I feel I get my money's worth for
I'm not sure though whether I feel I guess I am sure that I feel that in general though the allocation of the taxes in certain areas isn't correct
I'm sure that probably every person in this country would agree with you on that because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go
I lately or at least for the last twenty years or so I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost defense items at least in the last ten years have been there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there and I'm not really sure that we've gotten our money's worth there regardless of the outcome of the desert shield situations
I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military off and on over the years of being called back and things of that nature I've found that there's an extraordinary amount of waste I take that as a given in any military operation and
no argument here and I I should imagine that what the problem why I'm a little concerned about today is that this rather quick victory in the mideast over the iraqis might lead us into a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe I don't know what other foe that would be but I'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
of course a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the inventory's going to have to be restocked on I work for t I and one of the things we were told is they had eleven thousand harm missiles which t I is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in the war so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed but it would that be let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent I should imagine that that would be to keep it at those levels that were originally appropriated when the soviet threat was perceived as being a greater one I don't think there's very much of a threat there today I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in their territory over there and who's controlling them but
that's true that's true I don't know what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic from doing anything that would be irrational
of course now we used up twenty per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks
and t I also makes the missile which was the t v laser guided bombs
and a big percentage of that was expended as well that was just a matter of what is the name of that? it's called paveway
and a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also so those are two areas in which t I stands to gain some short term business to restock that what I'm concerned about talking about the taxes in general and that was an area that I perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there I don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and it's a cliche I but I see it myself I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways
no doubt I don't know I'm familiar with some upbeat school areas so I don't totally agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there but I guess overall because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools and rural school systems are like I should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure
as a matter of fact in texas we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by a state judge and they and the legislature just passed what they called a robin hood bill which basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent
they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system
or is it all funded out of local taxes?
to give you some perspective this town that I had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds
then we had a number of education reforms that the legislature said we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts so sounds like the way the federal and state system works now
so what ended up happening was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years and do you mean a complete reversal? because they can't raise that money in those poorer districts
complete it's all shifted to local districts and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state
that's right and I have no problem with a certain minimum level that's a standard that everybody ought to be able to have
but I am opposed to any attempts to restrict local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum I see what you're saying I guess I am a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education by that I mean I'm a product myself I have a background of getting my college education through the g I bill
so did I my masters anyway what but when I look at it to me it doesn't really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done I don't think I would have gone on unless I had that financial easement made possible
that's right and I don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're a veteran or whether you I don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless you promise to even do something in the future I think that the subsidy itself or I guess the enactment of that form of legislation would give many people who I think I perceive the fact
at least what I read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their budget I know in the state of florida just today the legislature adjourned and they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the state land grant colleges which isn't to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money but I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year
they went from eleven to fifteen hundred
and for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent I don't know what that would be
they had to raise community college taxes here a few years ago but I guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government was expending so much money on defense that the program now is fees that fund these things I guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now don't have enough money
so they must charge fees I'm not too sure of that reasoning
but I guess I don't know whether I pay too much taxes I travel extensively in europe and see enormous people pay a great deal in taxes they tell me when I sit and talk to people there they tell me they some states they pay in germany or in england in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes
I can believe that but I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax a sales tax which is getting to quite high levels
I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to that
I guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if the democrats had more say you really think so?
I really do but what's happened here is I feel that in the last ten years my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down I pay quite a bit more taxes and
everybody is but that's been a republican government for the last ten years
what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious I
this has been really interesting and I've enjoyed our talk I guess I just push something here push one again
we just say and that's it just hang up don good talking with you
nice talking with you too
I'm pretty pro gun control over all I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and I must say that there are a couple of arguments against strong gun control which I find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me I find use sort of canned arguments sort of the n r a slogan arguments and I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it I guess on a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns and I have to admit most of that is strong personal distaste I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort and guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me me being from texas
I hope you're ready for this I'll give it a try I've got my texan stereotypes in place
I'm not your stereotypical texan I was raised around guns hunting
so I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect
I respect them and what their capabilities are
and on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a green beret I definitely respect the power of weaponry it's pretty power isn't it?
and here in houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country and here you go here you this will be border line n r a which I am not a member of
you've heard the slogan if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns that applies to anything as well as guns a gun
you've got any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
and they get out their little mac tens they get out their little uzis and they're going to fight with them and it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm if they want it they'll get it I don't care if they've got to go down into new mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border my position although I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon anyway
since I am a law abiding citizen and I have never had a felony if I wanted to buy one I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it if they want to run a background check on me if they want to put a seven day waiting period again
if they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too what I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it wouldn't you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way I would hope because someone the personal sheriff doesn't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff
the criteria the sheriff would have to follow is this guy a convicted felon? is he a habitual trouble maker? are we picking him up every saturday for a drunk and disorderly
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems just proving that you're basically a good citizen but if you're not a basically good citizen you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway
if they want the firepower they can get it so why because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are they'll get it across the border one way or the other so why have any restrictions at all?
go back to that one to ten scale where one being full gun control ten being none
I'd said about an eight we could be
I said the restrictions I would like to see for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun I would like to see them go through either I'd like to see a law enforcement agency not n r a but whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics that makes a lot of since to me I certainly feel that we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon as a pistol
I have a bicycle and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things I'm still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway what's the point of putting a basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they're not going to take those courses is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns?
there's if it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices does that mean advantage?
not necessarily a price thing what is happening at least in this state legislation been introduced that if a citizen of the state being myself has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed
you're from california?
l a area? bay area san francisco bay area
you've been to the city?
and all these people come around someone attempts to mug me I would I would as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade
if this legislation comes through he I'm out with my family
we've gone shopping we're fixing to get in the car this guy comes up he pulls a blade on me I can pull a gun on him now and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick what if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon?
then it's still equally matched having spent time in combat I feel it before they'll get the gun on me I
if I'm at the same time I'm sure
I'm sure given all your training I'm sure that you'd
if I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk through with you because I'm sure you have far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything I'm quite concerned that if you let everyone hasn't yet committed a felony if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire it's hard for me to imagine that if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire
actually it's it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying I'm going to mug this guy right here but he's carrying just as much firepower as I can and if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it
whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not that's another trip but
in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat even more so when it comes to my wife and son
anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink I know
I understand that what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake?
this is where the question of gun control comes in that was the topic what I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot
say a person get all of a sudden my combat in me goes up and say I've got the vibes this guy's fixing to do something I go ahead and pull my piece
and I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him and I will use it right then
if he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family I'm going to dust you as it stands now I've got to do that with a blade and the only reason I feel comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had as someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander I feel more comfortable with people having blades because you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly and
if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss that's the kind of training I've had what kind of car would you like to buy next?
I guess cadillac I guess that's kind of everybody's dream why would that be?
I guess it's a general motors product and I like general motors because they're made in the united states and we've had general motors for years and have always had real good luck with them that's good
if you had no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy?
I think I'd still go with the cadillac do you?
I don't care about a big fancy which type of cadillac is your favorite?
I don't know I guess the seville or the seville
that's a sharp looking car
that really is it always has been though
they have been it doesn't have the coup de ville or the sedan de ville squareness it never really has it's always had it's own unique look
I've always liked that I liked the a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it
I thought that looks sharp
that looks real sharp
I think the ones now with all of the fancy gold lettering and all I think they're very pretty
and course a vinyl top I think those are pretty and the I've never ridden in one recently but they're supposed to be just real smooth
just a nice comfortable ride
they are and they're just always they look like they're sturdy
they look like they're very sturdy and you don't have to worry that much about getting hurt like you would in a small one now they've got a unique feature in them now if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't go into the inside it'll go underneath the car instead
I didn't know that so that's a big safety factor they've got in them now
and I suppose they all have the balloons the air bags
the air bags that's great that's great
you say you've always have preferred general motors products
I do I go for things built in the united states rather than foreign countries
help our economy and what kind of general motors cars have you had in the past? mostly oldsmobiles oldsmobiles those are real nice riding cars too
that's what we have now but of course if I have a choice I'd still have the cadillac but I've been very satisfied with the oldsmobiles we've driven them for about probably twenty years has that been the cutlass or the sierra?
the ninety eight the ninety eight
I don't think let's see the ninety eight that's got that big v eight engine in it doesn't it?
I don't know the one we have has a six has a little v six?
but it's a very good car it's not had one minute's problem with it it
and now I have twenty three thousand miles on it that's great
that's great that's always nice to get reliability in a product especially when you're spending anywhere from fifteen to twenty five thousand dollars for a single item
you just don't want any hassles with it
you expect it to do its job and I think a lot of car manufacturers don't take that into consideration
that's true they just expect you to buy their product but that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car going to be
price is an issue but it's not the most important issue
it really isn't because now you can get five year financing on them and
but I would go with the general motors any time I've always been a ford man myself
but that's all right
it's american made too which is good
but I've ever since I was growing up my dad's always had fords and I grew up in south dakota so everybody has a truck
and my ford trucks have just I've just never had problems with them
I honestly think I would die before my truck would keel over on me
I those are good products also let's see start
what kind of recycling programs do you have in rowlett? right now they've got kind of a central location off of the main highway and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper plastic three bins for glass white green and whatever other combination there is
and I think they've got some kind of container for aluminum
plano's doing real good on that they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it
and of course it doesn't fit right now
but now we start in may breaking it down and they're picking it all up
so they're going to by and we have to separate our papers and our glass and then they have one day for everything you picked up from your yard
and we put that in disposable bags and they pick that up on monday
so it's really great I'm completely for it I think it's marvelous that's good rowlett had sent out a survey not too long ago in terms in how many people were interested in having a pick up on the days they do trash or something like that and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably because they're going to do it I don't know how soon they're going to do it or how organized it's going to be but they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months
does your where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that? I've never noticed that we don't have a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria
down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your pop cans and things like that? there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea
so you don't have much choice there not really
I work at j c penny and last week they brought they have a sign up that says for one full week you bring in your old wire hangers
and they're going to recycle them
so it's getting people clean out their closets and such
and then the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in and they brought it down to the shelters and they have three that I know of for cans for people have pop
and they put them right near where they have the time cards and it works great and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too that's good
so they're really going at it and I think it's marvelous because I guess rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is
and I think they're trying to make some changes I noticed at the library or someplace this past month month and a half ago they were having a speaker talk about doing lawn work and how important it is to cut your lawn without a bag just to kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff
and it's a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil
did you watch the program the other night on save america? I saw part of that
it was good the only thing I thought that I haven't been trying is when I go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which I had never thought about before
but I've already gone to I started years ago I guess not years ago but I would say five years ago turning off my water faucet in the sink when I brush my teeth
but I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water
that was surprising to me
I missed that question totally really bad I'm trying to think I didn't miss too many I can't remember what my score was but I did exceeding well I was surprised but I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me there are a lot of things that aren't I'm that's one of the things I wonder about one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else I wonder about some of the products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take why they couldn't do more recycling with those
I was in bizmart the other day and what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more than regular paper
and it was only forty cents more fifty cents more but it upset me to realize that they're going through the expense of recycling
but people aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher I noticed that about things like I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is double or sometimes triple the regular fertilizers and things you buy
so in terms of that it's and for the environment there's a good reason to do it but the cost is kind of prohibitive
that's recycling companies that do at least go into it I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something or tax wise or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular
so that people would use this stuff over again it's a good idea
it's like when he was saying which one was recyclable which was reusable
and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles
and if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it I had to put my bifocals on to see it
that's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway
you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you haven't got enough nerve to say put it back it's not recyclable I'd heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on the radio station they were talking about the I think it's in canada they're using recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs as a reinforcement for roads for road repairs
and apparently they don't break down very easily and they don't expand or contract when the weather changes
and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing
they're along that same line they said they were using what is I know it was toilets the old ones? smashing them up because that stuff there is great in road work
and I thought that's good and then I saw recycling on tires between hoses were being used and soaker hoses made out of old tires
what else something else was made out of old tires I was trying to remember what it was I can't think of it now but I was trying to get my kids to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
and just anything to recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is I take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring the back and then I forget to bring them in the store
I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out I wish they'd really push this recycling bit because I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away I think the more people are aware of it the more they'll do I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
you know what I'd like to see a little more I don't have any little tiny kids
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now in five years when they get bigger it'll work a little bit more too
because it's we've all got to do it right now I just I really amazed to find out that eighty per cent are filled now in garbage fills in five years we're supposed to be at max
I don't think I can keep my own garbage I might not have that much but I wouldn't
what kind of vacations do you like to take?
we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to europe so I guess those are the types I like
we've really enjoyed them where have you gone there?
we've gone to germany switzerland austria ireland and england
we've been to germany twice
but I guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland I've been over there too
where have you been? I even let's see mostly germany and france
I lived in france for a year and a half so I was able
how neat but once when I had a chance in france to go on vacation instead of travelling around france I went to germany
because I've got relatives there and I just like it there that's neat
but austria I found really pretty and switzerland
and I lived in the alps in france so anything in the mountains over there I just love how neat
then I finally made it to england too on my way home I lived in africa actually and on my way home from there
you lived in africa?
and unless you fly from nairobi you have to fly through europe on your way home
so I went to england and I really liked it there too it's so expensive over there I know it's true that's the one thing
it really is it's I love to go over there but it's so darn expensive to go over
actually now you can get some really good deals flying over but it's
once you're there you still have to spend money unless you know people I know just
then you can stay with them and that helps a lot but
there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone
I'd like to go to hawaii some time and we made it
we've at least gone to the grand canyon and niagara falls so
feel like we've accomplished a little bit here I haven't I've most of my vacationing in the u s has been on the west coast
or this summer I went to colorado
and I'd love to go to the east coast during the fall
the it's I've always wanted to go there I've seen pictures and it looks gorgeous
we made a trip up the east coast it was in the summer
and it really is pretty
it's both coasts are really pretty
but I love the carolinas it's just gorgeous over there I haven't been anywhere on the east coast
I think tennessee has been the furthest east I've been
you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and go over there I guess so
but there's a lot to see here
but I just love going over to europe because their way of life is just so different than ours
we're so fast paced here and over there every time we'd go and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check
they're so leisurely over there
and it's kind of nice to have that so the type of vacation you'd like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week?
usually a bunch of different places probably because you want to see everything
see as much as you can while you're there I know
how did you like africa? I liked it I was working in cameroon africa
and it's not a place for tourists they're not used to having tourists there so it's
you're kind of roughing it but I liked it I liked it
the people there are just very friendly and
what type of work? I was working with an organization that does bible translation
so I was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and what they call survey work
find out where the languages are
so I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people
that's neat I enjoyed it so
I've talked to people who have been to africa and they and then of course when that movie out of africa came out
but I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there my cousin came over while I was there and she came to cameroon and then she went over to nairobi and took a safari around close to nairobi in kenya
how neat so she'd always dreamed of doing that too
that's great so so is there any place you would try to talk me into going to?
it sounds like we've been to some of the same places it does
do you think I wonder the assumption is that it is a problem and I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem but it's not clear to me that it is
it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem
that's interesting because I had thought I feel that it's a problem also but I see your point on that I assume that those who don't vote if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter but I don't know if that's the case
in fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't
apparently they don't think it's a problem I guess not I vote religiously I really do I guess I'm a fan of democracy and wish I could vote on more things frankly
that's right but it's funny because here in california things are getting increasingly democratically oriented in the sense of people being able to vote for things we have these state initiatives now
the first really popular wide spread one was proposition thirteen which was a tax revolt against property taxes
I and now we're and that was whatever ten years ago and now we're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that we've just there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals and you had to vote for yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult and a lot of people revolted against that they said we don't want to have to decide all these things
that's why we hire people to make these decisions for us
I kind of feel the opposite though I wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things I do
I think our elected officials say they are speaking for us but they're not speaking for me I wouldn't mind having more votes than I get to have frankly that's true anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as I can have their vote
that would make me happy though maybe not in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would I don't know it's interesting some countries voting is obligatory
it is in australia for example is that true? I didn't know that I was that is one solution to it I don't know how I feel about that
but I don't that's not really democratic not what I'd consider truly democratic australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the united states
as and it's not for me to say that they're not
they feel here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there just as we have a duty to pay taxes is that democratic? we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes
it's a duty and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic I don't know
but part of me rebels against that
it's complex question when you start thinking about it isn't it but then I'm an american
and some people don't vote there is like three or four percent of australians don't vote and I think they're eligible for a fine I don't know if they actually are fined or what happens but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote
that's interesting I have people here that I know that have never registered to vote
and I think they feel they can criticize if they don't I was sort of
I told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize I that's how I feel if you vote and your guy looses you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote part of me feels like if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you
that's right I feel and certainly that's true in the overall no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole I sort of feel that way especially when they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that and I say voting for the lesser of two evils is still important
I think it is too sometimes it is a difficult choice you don't feel as though you have much of a choice but it's funny because technically you do you have the right to do a write in candidate but of course that's not really a vote
it doesn't really gain anything it really doesn't and so it's a complicated situation but I would like to see I don't know I'm thinking of actually moving to australia and perhaps I'll call you back and let you know how the australian system works is that
I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity not I see and I
are you a t I employee I'm interested I'm not
not I just wondered so I'm really quite curious how that would work to have both and I believe in a certain soviet bloc countries you are obliged to vote too in fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently and that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system I don't know I kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty
maybe they should perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age required to register and vote for four years
and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty that's a thought or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have I don't know the right to write your
maybe it should go with a driver's license that's an example of a right not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right
that is a privilege but technically most people technically it's a privilege but most people think of it as a right in other words if the government denies you a driver's license people get very upset but actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked it is that's correct and fortunately voting isn't that
maybe it should be except if you're a felon if you're a felon it is taken away from you
they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances
that's right so so we don't have a great solution yet do we
don't have a great I think I checked that as a question I'd be willing to discuss too but I don't know if you've read any of the early republic documents when they were arguing through constitutional law written by hamilton and all those people
I haven't I think it was hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican not in the sense of the republican party now versus a democratic government and arguing successfully why the united states should be a republic not a democracy which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy
where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues in other words you vote for representatives
and the whole idea was presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority
and he makes a very passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process because anytime you have a majority they can change the law in a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case a if there's some minority that people don't like because of racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote against them
and cases like that need to be constrained and I agree except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote
sometimes I think we have that right now with congress I feel that
I think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job and there's also an antigovernment mood in the country where government is misspending your dollars and they're all fools and throw the bastards out that kind of thing
and there's a notion that somehow if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because if I'm hiring a plumber I want a real plumber I want someone trained in
the topic is to discuss the sources where I receive news
and for me that's mostly newspaper and radio I almost never watch television as a matter of course so I don't get news from television except during the war I watched a lot of c n n because it was so good
why was c n n the only of course I think saddam hussein only allowed c n n to broadcast it is that not true?
it was unusual not to have the different sources of news coverage
I don't know I guess I don't even know why I watched c n n I guess I just wanted more news it's one of the few times I wanted more news than I know even if you watched a b c n b c or the other what's the other one c b s
c b s they all were tapped into c n n were they?
that's the only thing they broadcast and like you I listened to radio on my job at work
and all this week they have been having a discussion about that is why c n n was I listen to a christian radio station
and they were saying that c n n is definitely a world news service and they it was you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got
we had some people from our church went to israel just for a tour sort of thing
and I was watching on tv they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in jerusalem so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it
and so it really made me question as to how do we know if the news we're getting is any good so
I guess the news just focuses on major events that probably don't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
but I'm from california and I can remember being in these earthquakes and they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and from anyone else's point of view
but they get all blown up in the news I find it depressing to watch our specially tv it's just local news concentrates on murders and things like that I'm from dallas and we have a lot of bad stuff it just really gets me depressed even to watch it
so then you wake up one morning and you are in war with somebody you don't even know about it
what newspapers do you read in dallas? we have the dallas times herald and the dallas morning news but I don't read newspapers don't you?
how come? I find it hard to follow from one page to another it's just something I have never developed an interest in
and I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's stolen before I can get out and get it
that sounds pretty bad to me who would steal a newspaper? you would be surprised
they just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the tv selections of the day I see I don't know it just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it
you're right who would steal a newspaper? but they do
what part of california are you from?
from los angeles but I live in raleigh north carolina right now that's where I am speaking to you from
but I grew up in l a I work out here you work for t I?
I don't I work for north carolina state university
but I know some people at t I and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them
I'm in the computer business I current events is not a good subject for me
I don't keep up with it that often
let's see I've never done this before I've never this is your first call? this is my first call because I just got my password
so I don't know are we suppose to it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes but I think we've been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted I got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten minutes I see so if we've done our three minutes let's just let the conversation end and say bye
nice talking to you nice talking to you too
I guess it's a subject I haven't thought too much about I don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools as much as we're expecting too much out of them
that might be a lot to do with it I know a lot of it here in my state I'm from mississippi I'm not sure where you're from minnesota wisconsin
minnesota a lot of it in mississippi here has got to do with funding
problems with our educational system a lot of it's due to money
and they're trying to spend money where we don't have it and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford it is getting very expensive to run schools so
it is they've got computers now that you got to train on there's just so much more and less money to do it with
that's true and a lot of it has to do with salaries too speaking of money
cause if you can't pay the right people they're not going to get the people that can do a good job I guess that in talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools I think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids and I think it should go right back to the parents if you don't train your kids right then
I feel the same way a lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home
and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids they've so severely limited what disciplinary action you can do I know when I was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving
they do that now and they could probably lose their job
lose their job and big lawsuit and all that
I feel that's got a lot to do with it people aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be it seems that'd be a subject that I don't have much to say on
we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education but he wasn't
and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly I know a lot of if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system
and unfortunately there's not many places to get that money
then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different I know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this that most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists they're teachers and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses and they're trying to teach social studies and they don't know a lot about that
where maybe a physics professor my professor was a physics professor and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level so therefore they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view and that causes a lot of trouble I don't know maybe they should sit back and kind of decide on where the money's best spent I know in a lot of cases different districts like to have nice fancy schools
and maybe they should be a little more concerned with paying the right people to teach and be satisfied with maybe a little older school
because here in the town I went to high school one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado so when they rebuilt that school they had a top of the line high tech school there
and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties and then when the evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them I know where I came from we didn't have a very rich community and high school that I went to was very old and as far as I know it's still there they've expanded on it but they've never built a new one and it's probably fifty sixty years old or better and I don't foresee them building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it
capital punishment I honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion
in the way that it's applied or it's applied at all? applied at all
so I how do you feel that it should be applied? I just feel like there's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets you know?
and that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced? not getting paroled in so many years
if you're going to sentence somebody twenty years let them stay twenty years that's I agree with that completely I know we don't have enough prisons but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people there has that's right
because if they turn around they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse
and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail
and they final get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars that's right that's honestly right and it's they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways you know?
they certainly are living at our expense they sure are just because some innocent person can really I didn't it seems like really a rough time
you know? I'm not saying innocent person let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance when they go to prison it really seem like it's a rough time for them
and a murderer well go to prison he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street
and be paroled and have served the sentence
that's what people face with that choice one thing I really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's going to
that should be life but instead in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something and then turn around in thirty years that and less they're out
if they're even in that long or they appeal and then they get an appeal that says it was an unjust amount of time an extraordinary long length or something time
I would just be I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole
I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent I think people know that it doesn't it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective
there's should be for this crime this is the penalty you killed someone in cold blood or whatever you get it back
this is what's going to happen
and it sounds horrible it I hear myself saying this but I don't know what else to do with some of these people that are but it's I know because they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again same thing
then they put them back in jail and they get out and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
and these guys just are on the endless merry go round in the legal system
and it's like I said at our expense a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either you know? but still it could
I know you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that something really horrible
and they just get away with it and nothing happens and as far as the other states I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is I haven't kept up anything like that
I think texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty
and I know california had it for a long time and then they took it off the books they repealed it
and people like charles manson and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison and are now even though california has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes
the people who were there originally when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are in prison in quote for life and are now coming up for parole some of them like manson who's come up
it's been denied fortunately but but still it came up though didn't it
the jury that sentenced him sentenced him to death
and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of california revoked the law in the early seventies and then they reinstated it later but the penalty didn't go back you know?
it seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side and isn't protecting the rest of the people the victim is really left out in the cold more or less doesn't it
especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you think
and the laws are all the rules some of the things that would make sense to tell the jury that this guy has a prior criminal history where he's raped ten women
and then he gets up for this one trial and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
and so they say this is I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal or plead insanity
and a lots of things
to some extent if they would do something with some of those people but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too they plead insanity
and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again I it just doesn't make sense
it's a scary world out there anymore where you're afraid to go out I
I know in the dallas metroplex area I don't go out hardly if I don't have to at night by myself
and I grew up in a smaller town in texas and it wasn't that way when I was younger like I said I live in a small place
we could go around and but even the small towns now though has really changed from when I was a kid but now I'm raising children it really is
ever you can't even when I was a kid I would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where I was and I was back on the time
and now I don't let my kids out of the front yard that I can't see them see them it really is we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon
but I've enjoyed talking to you
good talking to you too
I think life I grew up on a farm I don't what kind did you grow up in the farm
I grew up in at that time I was in trenton new jersey and it was a suburb of trenton so I really had mixture of suburb and urban living
I see I see little bit different
I think though it was much slower and much more self contained
I think you're right it's interesting I work in a high school
so I'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago to what I see these children doing
and the pressures on the children you hear this as an excuse but it's true they are so much greater unreal by comparison
I can not believe what they're doing academically the demands on them and I can see why children do drop out I think that's right
I can see the I can remember as a child nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where I wanted to go
it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me they were
and you didn't have to lock your door
and a some of these are urban worries but it's a lot different all though I guess twenty years a go now in this area things were similar because twenty years ago let's see it was after it's not all that long ago is it
twenty five years ago is when we had the washington riots
the first rights we've been having some problem now and it reminded me of that we were living in new jersey twenty years ago whereabouts? in allendale
and I use to have to go over to patterson when those riots were going on sometimes
I don't know though it's kind of hard to really know because of though the news media had those riots kind of blown up out of proportion
because I went there many times and
the washington riots weren't because I never saw a riot did you? the washington riots weren't because I lived right downtown washington
and what you saw was what you got I'm telling you that's what
but it is interesting they're so many they're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures the pressures of drug is so much the prevalence is so much greater
the kinds of diseases that you've got out the
the consequences is so much of what's going on is so much more serious then when we were younger I think that's true I think that's true
I think the other thing is that we have taken some rather drastic turns in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when I'm number one and worrying about self and not seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and support for young people the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things
and if you don't have some kind of basic believe or something down inside of you then it's very difficult to have anything to turn to when you've got something facing you like that that's true
I also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to
they're constantly excusing their child
and you can see exactly why the child is that way
you as a teacher can't hold a child accountable if you're not going to get reinforced by that at home that's right that's right
and you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day what's not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home that's right
and you get mixed signals so it's not always the school's systems I think a lot of it is the families the way you were mentioning there's so much more then that it starts very much deeper then that
I think that too I see some flickers of good directions turning
but whether they're soon enough and fast enough I don't know it's just
of course life is a lot more complicated too in ways the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now
with farming being so mechanized people working on the family farm which was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely
factory jobs are so much more sophisticated that's right
and the kinds of knowledge that it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and some people just don't have it
and there's so many people on the lower end of those who are going to be the drop outs and the poor and the homeless and whatnot
and you worry when the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children that's just another
in terms of what it's going to mean to a society in the future it's a
some ways it's rather frightening it really is it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of the jobs that is out there to be done in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be it certainly is it sure is
it sure is not that I really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago but
it was a little easier though wasn't it? just the volume makes a big difference
as uh mother I use to think sometimes it's not so much the kids it's just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and everything
and all the things demanded of the mother too
I look at my mother's life she didn't work for a long time when I was very young she didn't drive she learned to drive when I was a teenager and her life was a lot simpler and children's lives were simpler because mother was there and I sit here somebody was there
that's right and when there's nobody there
that's right that's right I always thought too that people worrying about going to work when their children are little and I think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much but I believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go work was when they were teenagers they need you more as a teenager
isn't that true that's why I'm working in a school system so that I'm home when they're home it's not so much that they come to you every minute but it's that you are there when they need you
that's isn't that that's so true
I find working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do
and it keeps me from being the old fogy but at the same time it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes I think that's true
as to what's but that's the same I'm home in the summers I'm home with the holidays that's
I'm home at three o clock when the children are at home or where home
one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college
and but that helps a lot
it does I have a daughter who just had a second job she needed to work and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so she would be able to interact with them
that's right and so I good kind of experience as well but
I I think that's really important I don't think people realize how important it is that is so true
and it's not that the children always say something but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment
and you realize it's important that and yet we have to make that choice I think twenty thirty years ago a lot of women just didn't have to make that choice
I think that's right what was your name again? I linda lee linda
and your name was? I think probably that we've just about
I enjoyed talking with you I'm going to change the world but
I enjoyed talking with you it's nice talking to you too do you have any children?
I have two boys twelve and sixteen twelve and sixteen
how about you? I have three and they're five and three and nineteen months
so we kind of got different ball game but
what do you feel like you have any time to spend with them?
they're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents that's true
you actually of course spend less time with them when they get older but it's of course still really important
I have a kind of a fortunate situation right now with my sixteen year old I work two nights a week at a I'm a librarian
and I work two nights a week at the senior high school library they keep it open for kids to do their work
and then the school district hires an aide to work for me
my son is my aide that's nice so two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together you're stuck together
and there's usually not very much business
some nights it's just real real quiet so I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part
so I have sort of a captive audience so I really do spend probably more time with him than most
but of course I'm away from my other son those hours too but his dad's at home pretty much that time and so that kind of gives him time with his dad then
that's true gives him a little bit of that individual time
but it is hard once they get that age their friends are the most important thing there is and they want to be able to spend
that's right I've even noticed that with my five year old she started kindergarten this year and every day that she's not at school she thinks we need to have someone over and play and that kind of
it's kind of hard it's hard I think I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should
I'm more worried about I didn't this done I didn't get the kitchen needs to be cleaned
this needs to be done and I need to remind myself to slow down
and it'll still be there tomorrow
that's true but that's kind of hard to do
it is hard to do you don't see yourself getting
if you're kind of a person that likes things organized or neat or
then I think it is hard it's I think one of the nice things about holidays is that it does give you the opportunity to spend more time with family slow down a little bit
we often go to illinois for christmas
and we're not this year and it's just really nice because we can do the things you want to do you can do more than when you travel
that's right this is the first year we're staying home too and I think it's going to be real quiet but that's an opportunity to get out the games and
we usually do that my kids even have already gotten out my twelve year old got out the legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer of course
but every now and then he's got a lot of those hard kind and he wants to be an engineer so he still likes all that kind of building stuff
and we have the train and we haven't had that lego train together for years so he sat down and I told him I really wanted him to build the train and we would put it under the tree and that I would keep it together I wouldn't take it apart wouldn't take it apart after that
and every year I'd have the lego train under the tree that'd be kind of fun
so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on friday and then his sixteen year old brother started helping too
these are kind of things during the normal rat race
those kinds of things never happen
but in fact I think if people would learn to turn off the t v s and
I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family which is usually people are not sitting in front of that
and there's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it they're totally turned off to everything else the rest of and you can't communicate while you're doing that?
that's right whereas I'm the type of person I could not sit I shouldn't say I could not but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something me too
I don't watch very much of it at all to the extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that because they talk so much isn't that the
they talk about t v shows and I how can you watch that you're kind of what are you talking about and it's the best show on I don't know you feel like you're a little bit out of it don't you they need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's I'll let you go first
what's there to say? doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that I don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty
I know what you mean I in maryland they do have capital punishment
and I've seen a lot of people get sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals
from what I I saw a statistic just a few days ago so far this year during a year's time they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row
so I and it's building up they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
and here in maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons just
everybody's got that but in here it's to the point where they were letting prisoners go commuting the sentences of those that were in jail for lesser crimes in order to put more people into the jails
and it was just amazing to me and of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and being rearrested an
isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was I can't remember refresh my memory
that was the one that was used so much in the campaign in the presidential race it may not have been maryland it may have been massachusetts I don't remember I don't remember myself
the question is do you think it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right? if they started executing them on a regular basis I think it might make a difference right now I don't see it making a difference
if it I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death most people out there committing murders don't care
they just don't care
I think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished
the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or they don't serve very much of the time and so their success rate is very high crime does pay you can make a good living at it and there's a lot of people here in baltimore that have and we just had a real big cocaine bust and of course they're playing it up real big that it looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy
but baltimore has an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year
last year it was d c I guess baltimore caught them it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that there's x number of people out there that are going to commit murders
and once you kill off a few of them
if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that pretty soon you run out of people to murder
the only consolation is so many of the murders are the violent people going against each other and so they society's not going to put them to death at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to I think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently
I personally think life imprisonment I don't think much of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life but second why should we the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again then why bother just execute them because that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again
so anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole I'd say give them the death penalty so it makes sense you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but so few and far between makes good t v movies and that's about it
and also the thing I don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can I hide and what do I have to tell
and I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are
and that way we can be sure we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened and base the sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear I had my father in law participated in a jury trial he was actually on the jury
and this man was accused of killing two people and shooting a policeman point blank in the face of course he didn't die
and this was during a holdup of a restaurant and it came out during the trial that they had tried to rob another place and when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies jumbo cookies and so they were so upset from robbing this guy trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started shooting people just started shooting people because they botched the first job you know it's
so now they're going to get even
and get even with who
stupid guys and it turned out that the policeman survived to the point that he was able to identify the guy
and of course they tried to make the cop look like he was a no good rotten drunk it was amazing
what was the verdict what was the results there he was found guilty
he last I heard he beat a push for the death penalty whether they finally got it or not I don't know
I kind of stopped listening after a while
he would come home and after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to after he had to go
the penalty phase they decide the penalty separately from the verdict and everybody was pretty much let's burn him
and that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he some people on the case were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate
you just have to decide there's really two separate decisions there I guess one is did it really happen the way the prosecutor said it happened is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide as a member of society what do I want to do with this guy who did this thing
and that I've never been on a jury I've never had that experience I'm not sure I'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life it went pretty quick from what he said
but there's a lot of other crimes out there besides murder I think now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something there's a death penalty associated with it
the thing I'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence I can handle people selling drugs it's wrong but it's not worth somebody getting executed for but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing
and the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life that you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not I agree
and so I go these are the kind of people I would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say we don't accept your kind in our society I agree I have a low tolerance for that kind of person and as far as there are some other crimes that I think kidnapping when they kidnapping per se has a certain fine and penalty associated with it
but some of these people are just out and out brutal I some of the cases I've heard about over the years I guess we're on
hang on let me try it again because usually do you usually get a message?
hang on let me check on it I don't know
let me try it once more I think we're on maybe
I guess we'll find out
in maryland are you a skins fan? not really from I really wasn't from here so the teams I really root for in football are the niners and the seahawks only the niners because I used to live out in california I like seattle because I like seattle
and besides I like the city
so you were out there in san francisco? san jose actually but close
other than the big catch with the forty niners and the cowboys back a few year ago I like san francisco
but I don't know I never really was a cowboys fan until I moved down to texas is that where you are now?
I'm in dallas and I guess when you're down here in dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the cowboys because this is a big football territory down here
and unfortunately of course the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years
that I don't know everybody's kind of they're still behind them but it's not like it used to be you back the winners and you don't back them when they're not doing well
that's right but I think actually in trying to follow the cowboys over the years they used to have a philosophy for probably the last twenty five years except for about the last about five or six years they always went out and tried to draft the best athletes and didn't really draft for any particular spot
but they would go out and try to go for the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche
and then about four or five years ago they started going after specific players or positions the press would get down on landry and this is when schramm was still there
and they'd go after them saying what you really need is a defensive end so they'd go out and try to find a defensive end and when they drafted somebody and he didn't work out at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else
so I think it was kind ever interesting I think the decline of the cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with not drafting the best athletes it makes sense because you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can do a bunch of different things
but and I don't my main sport is baseball but I've been enjoying football but I don't know it as well
I just cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they? is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the walker trade or what was the whole deal on that?
they still have some draft picks that they got they don't have anything high do they?
actually they picked up some from minnesota I think it was minnesota's that's right that's right they it went the other way
what was I thinking they traded herschel to minnesota
they traded walker my brain is really working well tonight
that's okay they I've got a friend that lives right next to the cowboys training camp
and he sees them out running a lot and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys and they're all thinking that they really got something going this year
but I guess when you have a whole bunch of professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes I guess it's the same way with baseball or anybody
spring training until you actually start going out and getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good if you go to I'm sure if you go to any of the twenty eight coaches in football in training camp they say we're going to be super bowl champs because I know in baseball any manager you go to say we're going to be in the world series even though there's not a prayer
this is the way it is kim didn't the cowboys even finish they finished pretty close to five hundred last year didn't they?
they did as a matter of fact because they only won one game the year before?
I enjoyed that because it was against the skins
you don't like the skins? I live near baltimore and I really don't like d c a whole lot at all
and I'm really they got a big thing because of the expansion going on in baseball d c is talking about how they're going to get a baseball team and everything it's you guys aren't going to get a baseball team I'm sorry it's not going to happen
but of course the griping is that if washington doesn't get a baseball team then baltimore shouldn't get a football team which is probably true but anyway I've never liked d c a whole lot and a really hate the redskins and a lot of it's because I got a lot of people at work with and everything that are big redskin fans of course
of course then you're not that far from philadelphia I've never liked philadelphia the city a whole lot the only reason I really enjoy the eagles at all is because I really like randall cunningham
I it was buddy ryan the one that I can't stand too much considering how well he gets along with jimmy johnson that doesn't surprise me
there was this in the baltimore sun has this cartoonist in the sports section and when last I guess it was january when jimmy johnson got named coach of the year or whatever
it was the same year that buddy ryan got fired and he had this cartoon in there about jimmy johnson's big day the first thing is the phone call from the league saying he was coach of the year and the second was this phone call from buddy ryan I got fired can you believe that
actually you said you lived near baltimore?
you're out I used to travel out that way a lot and actually I used to drive a lot between baltimore and washington and I lived do you know what ellicott city is?
it's just west of baltimore off route seventy
but route seventy and route forty
I used to go out of b w I a lot that's not far from where the new football stadium would be if we got an n f l team
they've built a new stadium downtown it's opening next year
is that near the what do they I forgot the name of it is it the wharf or the inner harbor the inner harbor
it's a couple of blocks west there is an old railroad yard basically
there's a big long railroad shed and then there's an old station and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the inner harbor which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the inner harbor and the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall
but they're building the baseball stadium and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a n f l team
so it's real easy access from south of baltimore like the airport or more importantly for the orioles from washington d c
the orioles say they get twenty five percent of their attendance from d c
I tell you what I the there's the colts still to me are the baltimore colts
you know? they really ought to change the name in indianapolis I never been real thrilled with not sitting here and talking about all the cities that I hate I went to purdue university for a couple of years and really learned to hate indianapolis while I was out there
and I was not real happy when they left to go there of all places
did you graduate from purdue? I transferred to delaware and graduated there delaware?
there's not a whole lot in delaware but it's close to philadelphia and baltimore so it's
that's true I take it you're an east coast type guy? plus the west coast kind of all over the place but east coast lately let's see how old are you lisa? I'm twenty how old are you? I'm older older older than you are
we are supposed to talk about places we like to go so I'm going and where are you calling from? I'm calling from provo utah but I'm from plano texas
you are from plano my sister lives in plano
her husband is the new director of admissions at university of texas at dallas
so my dad used to work at u t d also generally we just go on family vacations to arizona
where's your favorite place to go? my grandparents live there that's generally our usual summer vacation
where in arizona? tempe
I've never been to tempe
that's where I'd like to go what do you like about tempe? mainly just being with family is it we just hang out and my grandparents have a pool so we go swimming and
pretty hot isn't it in the summer? but we keep cool just by going swimming and it's fun to be with my cousins they're up there also my grandparents and my cousins that's good
been to hawaii? have you?
in fact I just got some reservations I'm going to go for almost two weeks this winter
it's the longest actually I lived there so I was there longer but two weeks is the longest vacation I'll have ever taken there so I'm kind of looking forward to that one around christmas time? in march
we're going to go in march after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way
so I think I would like to go to arizona I was in phoenix in january last january but it was rainy and icky it was the coldest it's been there ever in january I think it's very cold so do you travel a lot but I would like to go to tempe or
do we travel a lot? some I was a travel agent
I have been up until just a few months ago but I'm thinking of going back to work
so you know a lot of good vacation spots
I know a lot of good places to go but you definitely need to go to hawaii that's your favorite?
it is my favorite my husband hasn't been to europe yet and I'd like to take him there but he's traveled all over the united states and I haven't I haven't been down south I'd like to go to new orleans have you been there? I haven't where do you live?
I live in yakima washington
so it's cold and rainy today it's yucky
but we've had some pretty nice weather we played tennis outdoors until last week so that's a pretty good deal
do you go to school in provo utah? I do do you use nuskin skin care they're located in provo I work for nuskin do you? I'm a nuskin person
I sell nuskin too I am my only
and best not only and best but I'm my best customer
since we're not supposed to talk about this though is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream?
do you know? I don't maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing I would use I have that too I'm forty two I need something I need more than the intensive eye?
I didn't know if there was anything else and I use the celltrex
but nuskin is wonderful
I think it's a wonderful product do you use it? I do we get free products every month so
that's great now I'm getting about sixty bucks a month free products so
I've worked there about a year
that's good are they good to work for? they're wonderful to work for that's great
so we're supposed to be talking about places to go and you have not been to europe do you go to school?
do you ski? I ski I've
ski you probably ski very well in utah I don't actually since I grew up in texas I've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about five times each season
why did you move to utah? you are going to school? at b y u I
is that where b y u is?
I know some people that went to b y u that's great pretty good I do like to ski
pretty down there I said I do like to ski
so where have you skied? and it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go
if you like that kind of thing
you're a sophomore or junior? I am actually a junior beginning of my junior year you're a junior good for you what are you studying? nursing good for you you sound like a girl that has it together I would just encourage you to do a little traveling though before you get married because when you get married you won't have the money or the time you think I know
so just don't be in any hurry I'm not I'm not
you really should go to europe I went to europe for six weeks after I graduated from college and that was just I could have had that or a down payment on a new car and I took the trip and and it was great?
I traveled with a group of sixteen other students actually there was two other graduating seniors besides myself and we just had a ball we stayed at how long did you get to stay there? six weeks
it was wonderful so you should think about doing something like that I just had a friend that got back from europe and she was there all winter semester surprised they get anybody this time of day but I've been trying all different times
but I don't get anybody at five thirty don't get anybody at nine at night so thought I'll try I'm at work
and I just happened to walk back into my office
I've been gone for a little while I go to school so I'm home certain days
and I really haven't been making any phone calls have you? got
I haven't ever made any I just receive them have you received many?
I haven't here lately
it's the first time we were on this it came just about every day
I never had to make one they just always came
people must be tired of it or something
I guess we're supposed to discuss this subject what do you think?
I never gave it any thought myself
I was hoping you could tell me what you thought I don't have any objection to people doing that I think it might be good for them
but as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent
I'm just concerned about their safety
because if they do good work in america they'll probably be sent to a ghetto
and if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried
that would be my main objection I don't think
I don't know I think maybe it should stay on a voluntary basis it will probably never happen but
I think it would be good for everyone to do something like that but I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you it probably won't
I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway we can't seem to pay for all the little things we have going now
that's another consideration
but I don't know some kids are so spoiled nowadays it might be a real eye opener
sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes and then they think they're just kind of shocked at that side of town
I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl
I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while that would be an eye opener wouldn't it?
wouldn't it though? right next to us is such a pitiful country
it is I know sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries I never even heard of
I know it it seems to me we are it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country right on our borders but what do I know?
I'm just sitting at home and doing laundry today and certainly not up nobody has called me from washington
but how did you get on this program?
I work at t I you do work at t I? you're in lewisville
I just went by that place we were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost and we went by that's the first time I'd seen it it looked really nice
a lot of trees there it looked like a sight hang on a minute
I don't think so patty might I'm back
but how did you get on it? my husband works at t I over on central
why we're living in arlington I'm not so sure but he works over there and we did it last time
so just my daughter and I are registered this time I don't know they didn't even ask him back
that was weird wasn't it?
but like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time
I don't get too many and I can never find anybody so
the first time I used to get calls from far away too
like maryland and new jersey
but now it just seems like it's in the dallas fort worth area that I get calls from I've had the same experiences
all right around here
I don't know I wonder if they really I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents
there's so many with this one town even in some families some people talk a little bit different
my husband is from new jersey and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way and that's one family? of course I think everybody in new jersey sounds a little bit funny but
I agree you know how that goes
I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet sometimes she says at night or overloads
so end your conversation
do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject?
I sure don't you don't have any kids you want to send over here? no kids is
I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto one of them is real idealistic she might my sister is I'd be more suited to that than her she's just bugs we're energized
painting interesting the guy called me when the computer called me I thought that they were reading my mind I'm in the middle of going out for bids to have my house painted
painting is not hard to do as long as it's not to the point of where it needs to be scraped and peeling
and our house is not but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap and it's just a hassle to go through it so I'm looking for the easy way out
I know is easy to find painters to do this for you? it's easier to find painters but you have to be aware of how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good two coats and are they going to caulk are you talking outside or inside? exterior
exterior interior's not so bad because it's more fun it's more but
outside you have high peeks and those kind of things
it can be a real issue
when we've painted right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front
so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted but it the problem is that the sun hits it so preparing is a real problem
you've got to prepare it well or else it will flake
here they some of the home builders are they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money so they put up a quarter inch masonite basically and they painted it kind of a spun of a sorts so it's real cheap and I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and as low as five hundred and forty dollars so it's just a matter of
that's quite a range it's
there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap and I'm so much worried about that as what I don't want it all over the brick and windows and
which might be a bigger problem than it would be
so you haven't had any jobs painted in your house recently
we have done a little painting ourselves we painted the bedroom within the last couple of months that's fun
and we have some more that need to be done
but the problem that we've owned this house almost five years now and when we bought it it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired but the daughter was a real estate agent and she was selling it and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house so she told us that the house had been professionally painted recently and it looked pretty good the interior walls all basically white but they obviously had been done without to much wear afterward the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the door frames
when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it that's not very
big long strips so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly and some of still has to be redone they just painted over varnished wood
actually it had been a repaint job
but they had not either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they because it was woodwork so it looked as if it had been painted correctly with an enamel or something
either that or it had not been prepared underneath and it was greasy or something
it comes off in strips not even little bit so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time
we know what a job it's going to be because you almost have to strip the whole thing in order to do it again I wish you good luck thank you very much thank you
I can go ahead and start and tell you mine and
we're from san antonio and that's where I grew up
so I was used to the heat out here right now
it gets to about high seventies and it gets very cold at night
and monterey it's right on the coast and I don't know if you're familiar with california coastline but we're about a two hour drive south of san francisco
and it's really nice it's a big area for people to come from the different countries mostly japan germany and england and they usually go to carmel and vacation on the beaches so it's pretty nice year round but always cool in the evenings and warm in the summer but it stays pretty cold even during the winter for as nice as it is
and we usually get a fog right about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast and then it usually breaks back off again the next morning and if you go just a little bit ways in the weather completely changes
and it gets very hot and dry and the fog never makes it that far
but along here it's very different from the texas type weather what's it like down there? right now we're having the little bit of spring that we have
at least you've got some we don't have many seasons here it goes from winter to summer usually
spring usually consists of a lot of rain especially thunderstorms we had one of those blow through tonight
that's good and I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days
have y'all been having any heat waves or the ninety degree it's gotten up to ninety a couple of times
but basically it's been in the low seventies and eighties
women that's good for this time of year it's not really been too bad
usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier
do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year? quite a bit
the season is just about over for that in fact we drove down to corpus last week
and there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way
I miss that drove through san antonio and I spoke to somebody else this morning from san antonio and were they had and we came back what day was that sunday evening and they had a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now
that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas I'm glad to hear that that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring
we had a pretty rainy fall last year as well
y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you? we've had a few down here but not anything like kansas
but this is the season for that
they do pop up occasionally around here
I really don't miss all the heat there
I'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief I'm from here originally so when it's july and august I'm pretty well used to the hundred degree temperatures
the biggest problem with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil it's that black clay soil
is that what dallas is it's not sandy like most of the state is so it doesn't absorb the water real well
once it rains a little bit it's filled up and everything else just runs off you know
san antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes
I didn't realize that dallas had that same problem we have it especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years and there's a section in south dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
we could use some rain up here we're in the bottom of the fourth year of drought up here
and they had a pretty good early spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years
so they're still talking water rationing this summer so it would seem strange because in san antonio we had lived out west of san antonio in castroville
and the water in medina lake and that area was really going down that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing and I thought I'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the california pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's no problem with water and then I came here and found out they were in the four year draught
so I said this is pretty much like texas and it pretty much is in the middle of summer they have rolling hills around here but they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green
but it's a really nice area it's just such a change from texas because I had grown up with the heat
and used to essentially like you said you have the cold winter and then you have the hot summer spring
and to come here it's kind of the temperate weather all year round it's kind of like spring year round and then in the winter and then it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall year round
so it seems like we only have two springs or two seasons and that would be spring and fall
we never really get any of the other ones
but it's a really nice change of pace I guess I'd prefer that
to the heat I really don't miss the heat
we do a lot of when you do a lot of outside running and stuff it's just so much easier up here
and you don't have to worry about the high humidity
does dallas get high humidity? or is it pretty dry it's pretty dry we get some when it's this rainy but it's nothing like san antonio summers it's nothing like houston
or east texas is a little more humid
it seems like san antonio is increasing in humidity over the years because I had lived in san antonio for about twenty years
and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid and here it's right by the ocean
but it's not the same as corpus corpus you get that humid salty feeling in the air
but here the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit because it's just extremely cold
and I for some reason because of the cold ocean water the air is always cool it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling so I really like that about this area and we just hadn't expected it we were used to what gulf coast weather was like when we came here to pacific coast weather
it's just completely different and it's much nicer probably the pacific breezes make a lot of difference
it does and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but you but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought we'll take advantage of it and see what all the pacific coast is like that's nice
it's been good my wife's originally from virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me
I imagine virginia gets real humid doesn't it? parts do we're over in the western edge in the mountains
and they have of course some pretty severe storms winter storms snow and that type of thing
but they're so good about clearing the roads that it doesn't usually bother you very much
not like texas where everything comes to a stand still their springs and summers are pretty mild too it never gets real real hot
I'll have to try that out because I had heard that north carolina was sort of like that
and I've just never really been in that region of the country and I guess I'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like because a lot of people that are from that north carolina region really like it and they get the snow but they said it doesn't really get messy and it doesn't really hang around that long
the people I know that are from there they always miss it and they want to go back nothing seems quite as good but anyway as we were talking the weather came on and there's a flash flood watch and more rain for the next three or four days
I hope it moves up this way but I'm sure it won't maybe we can send you some
because we could sure use it you think that takes care of the time and I think that will do it
I sure appreciate hearing how things are going in texas and I enjoyed talking with you lisa
good luck to you you too we'll see you
do you exercise regularly? there is I am a school teacher
and us there is uh girl that went through our school district who does aerobics at the y w c a
turn that off I am recording my husband just turned on something noisy
she comes to the school and there are a group of teachers and we exercise regularly for an hour
and we do it twice a week
that is good and we do aerobics for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes
so it is an hour and then my husband and I take ten mile walks as often as possible
and not on the nights that I do aerobics but if he wants to he jogs but we take the fast walks and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house
and so we take it seriously we enjoy doing it I enjoy my group at school it is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself
I use to exercise regularly and I haven't lately
I have goofed off I guess I use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work
but I guess my job change my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more I understand that
so I have never been able to do it before
the problem is that I am so tired at the end of the day I just want to go home and not do anything I and too I just make myself
I get up at five thirty and I am at school at seven thirty
school is not over until four
and our class but it is in the building
that is the big difference because there are other people around that you had better hurry go get dressed there is motivation around there and then we can change right there in the building I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere
and I just go and we exercise and until then I have belonged to exercise clubs and I have gone to these gyms in plano and richardson where they offer aerobics
and I have done that before but it has always had to be late at night after I have got home and after dinner
and you are just kind of going ugh
and I have tried it immediately after school try to get some place and exercise from five to six but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late that is right that is right that is a it is it is really hard with our life style when you work to
I know some people go during lunch but by the time I get over the gym and go for my class and shower and get back to work it is probably two hours or more and that is just too long I have twenty five minutes for lunch that is out for me
that doesn't really do it does it? I don't think so
and they are nice because if we are running late it usually if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us cause they know we are in the building and coming where as at another place you are paying a lot more money
and it does going to start whether you are there or not that is right that is right so this has worked out real nicely in fact she charges us two dollars a session
that is not much so it's we pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is a unit in school report card period
and so it is twenty four dollars every six weeks that is not bad it beats memberships at some of these clubs that is for sure you are not kidding
they are real expensive I know we belonged for a period of time to the signature club for about a year
we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership
and at first we used it and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth
and they offered lots of things but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to
so we decided to forget that
that was just a waste of our money
we have one through work and it's probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year which is bad
but I don't know I still just don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or something but I need to do something if it's only walk the dog or something I need to start doing that it does make you feel better the hard thing is getting going
that is right and if you have somebody who will do it with you for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to jog
but he decided that maybe
I guess tonight's subject is woodworking
what kind of woodworking do you do? do you
kind of mainly the woodworking I've done lately is made for example a little nativity scene not the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and some odd stuff around the house
and so I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and I do it out of hobby more than something I have to do how about yourself?
I like to think of it as a hobby but I guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house
a few years ago they needed some book shelves and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and it actually worked pretty well and over the years I've refined those plans I got myself a router and I'm very good at making book shelves
it's also a way of relieving stress my wife kind of laughs at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves
I'll have to come and see them that sounds like a good idea I and that is right it is out of necessity because lot of the things that we can't be able to afford but also I sometimes think that I enjoy doing that and I like to get out and to work with my hands and sounds like you got some real nice tools too do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools?
little by little I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things
gotten a good belt sander and the router helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
the latest project that I've been working on is a cabinet to put a t v in a entertainment type center?
and it works well because you can design it to suit whatever equipment you have so I designed a space just the right size for the t v and then the v c r and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment
and that's worked pretty well with the router you can make nice I guess dado joints is what it's called or I I'm aware of that and it's
and also with a router you can make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge and casings and so forth that are real nice that's right that's right
so that's good that's good
but what I need next is a good table saw
and I debate whether it's better to get just a straight table saw or to get one of these rotary arm saws
radial arm saw is what they're called
it seems to me the radial arm saw is better it takes up less room
you set the wood down and you move the saw
whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a table saw and with a radial arm saw if you do have a big piece of wood that you need to rip or cut you wouldn't be able to do that but a table saw does take a lot of space and is a pretty big investment and
that's partly my problem now I don't have room for this I where we lived before up north basements were common and I used to put all the stuff in my basement
but not so here in texas
they don't have basements I'm from up north also and there's no basements down here and it's kind of hard to get shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that
lot of the equipment too that I've used in the past I've used in school and I would I don't know I'd kind of like to look at equipment like a lathe or a table saw and some of those things that would make some pretty nice pieces of wood for different things for tables for chairs for decks and so forth so I don't know
I just enjoy woodworking and I think the main thing is like you say it's a good out it's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day and it's a great stress reliever
have you ever used a lathe? in school I have and I've made different things tables for chairs and I've made bowls and
you think you're getting your money's worth? never
the only thing I'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in texas that's probably the next year's agenda
I tell you what I sure hope they don't pass something like that they're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around and I think one way or the other we're going to pay for the bureaucracy I guess it's one area that is really hurting the economy more than anything I think every time you turn around they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now
I tell you I remember every time it seems like we turned around they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline that's right that's right
and actually that one the taxes on gasoline don't bug me as much as eight and a quarter percent sales tax? that's right
and every time you go to buy anything now even they tax food that's the one that really kind of bothers me I think that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board as far as ability to pay which allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards but now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of taxes on everything they buy and where people make two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on and that's the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but I don't think it is anymore not in texas anyway
I got you because people that don't make very much money wind up spending it all that's right that's right
whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on that's right that's right and that's the unfairness of the thing but I think taxes generally are unfair so
what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over thirty thousand dollars? like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much
I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so it doesn't I think generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is
and I guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car that's their prerogative I don't have a whole of sympathy on that maybe you buy that and I don't mean to be knocking
I haven't but to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax on top of it and there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that unless they really want it buy something that more it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids it's a way of increasing the population that was one of the initial ideas of giving exemptions on kids on federal taxes
and where you exempt things like one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably lloyd bentsen said that if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be spending more money using their credit cards
I don't know if that's true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and any kind of interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers
so that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go tax things that they don't to a degree like booze example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point it makes drunks sober they quit buying it
what about the taxes on cigarettes?
what kind of hobbies do you have?
mostly what I do I do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing and then I read a lot I like to read too I was trying to think of some while it was talking about it and then I it took so long for someone to answer I started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it
but I'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones because it's the type of thing that you can do a little bit at a time whereas I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it or if I had the space
I live in a pretty small apartment and I would have to put stuff away I have two cats so I couldn't really leave it out if I was working on something
reading is a little bit easier to work around
you can pick it up and take it wherever you go any space that's right I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing that's true I do the same thing you get so involved in what you're reading what types of crafts do you do?
I do a little bit of woodworking I used to I don't have the equipment here we moved to dallas about a year ago
and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment
and I did some of that here I've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand sewing and quilting and what else have I done? things to hang on the wall
mostly just stuff that I can use right around the house or give away as gifts
I've been making a lot of quilts not a lot but several quilts lately
I enjoy sewing and needlework also I've made some small things cross stitch things and back when I was in high school I worked at a needlework shop
and I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that and I still remember how to do it it's just been so long since I've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that but I have recently done some cross stitch
and I enjoy doing that it's just the same old thing it's just getting the time to do it
I've done some cross stitch but I never count right and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or something
it never has worked out completely it takes a lot of concentration it was the type of thing I was making some little things for christmas and I also made a little thing for a baby gift and I thought I can do this while I watch t v
you must pay all attention to what you're doing it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be it took me quite a bit of time I though this won't take long at all but I was wrong
it took a while to do but it was fun I enjoyed it
the first project I started out one was a big one it was of a lady and she was kneeling and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe
and I it was just too much to start with and I still haven't finished it because I stopped and I thought I better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to get it done
and there were so many different shadings and colors and it was just too much to begin with and kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it that's pretty understandable
and I've done some of the crewel and something similar to that
but it doesn't have the specific stitches it's a little bit more loose and not quite as structured and I like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that
more like embroidery or something I'm trying to think of anything else I do as a hobby I don't even watch t v very much I was tonight but
I was reading when you called
how about movies do you like to go to movies? I do I do like to go to movies and I have a v c r so I like to rent movies and right now I have the movie channel so I've recorded quite a few movies off of that just I've kind of got a collection going of tapes now and whenever I go visit my parents they're always saying bring some of your tapes they always borrow a few of them I was over there they live in duncanville
and I was over there at easter and they said bring some tapes with you so they are always borrowing my tapes but
we I like to do stuff with plants I have a lot of plants in my apartment and I've got a pretty small porch but it's I've got a few planters out there that I'll in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there and then in the summer I'll plant petunias or something that's colorful and that blooms a lot but haven't done that yet
I kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time but I think we're probably past that now I probably should go buy some
I guess if I had a house I might enjoy gardening some I'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that
it's the hard work I like the planting and watering is okay
it's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers it's so we don't we live in an apartment also
I've got a few plants here but I'm not really knowledgeable I feel real good if I water them and they continue to grow I feel like I've accomplished something
so I enjoy it but I'm just not experienced enough with it I don't know too much about it either mine's pretty limited to my little porch plants and then the ones in my apartment half of which don't look real healthy but I don't always get direct sun except in certain spots
and so that's probably my problem there but
have you tried growing any fruits and vegetables or anything? I guess vegetables are in pots and stuff? I never have tried that just because I don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment or this little balcony
and my other two pots are they're pretty big and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood there's no room for much else
but my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house and I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff
but I've never really tried anything like that since then
I considered it last year and this year both but I haven't done anything about it
so I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch we get lots of sunlight here and the porch is screened in and it's pretty large
so I think if I'd do something be motivated enough to do something it would work out well
but there goes that motivation thing again I enjoy playing with my cats I don't know if you'd call that a hobby but I have two cats and I gave them a bath tonight so they're a little bit angry at me
can you put them right in the water? they didn't like it too much
that's good right in the tub and it helps because it's the time of the year that they're shedding a lot and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine so I thought this'll help them shed
and sure enough the fur just came off like crazy once I got them in the tub
so they're pretty content now but they were mad at me for quite a while they went and hid after they got dried off sulked for a while
I like animals but we don't have any yet we have a nine month old with another on the way
and we thought maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll
or get into a house with a little more space I'd love to have some animals
but I like dogs and my husband likes cats so we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet if we get a place where we can have both it'll be great but until then I like both but since I'm in an apartment I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog to me dogs need a yard even little dogs
they just need a yard cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine but I just think dogs need to be outside though so
I agree with you I if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat or even a bird or a fish tank or something small that's an idea with the small babies
that she can watch but won't take too much care because even a cat you never know when they might bite or scratch or something
they're not as likely to as a dog might I guess but with little ones I'd be kind of scared to get anything that has teeth or claws
especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting that they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk
and if I was a cat or dog I'd respond probably by biting or something I don't know
that'd be my self defense but I think we probably reached our time limit
probably and I'm out of good ideas for a hobby anyway
it was good talking to you
thank you for calling
my favorite probably all time t v show is star trek and I would it like that I like the adventure of it and the idea that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space
and then I like the they have a new one now the star trek the next generation which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and doing new things and finding out about different people
and I've always liked that show probably the very best
I think I've actually seen a number of star treks one way or another over the years although I never watched it regularly I'm certainly acquainted with the characters
and then I've seen some of the star trek movies those the movies are good too
and I guess most of the shows I like are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure
when I started thinking about this those are some of my favorite shows mcgyver because it's only one person there instead of a cast of people
but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and
I don't think I've even heard of that show you haven't?
it's called mcgyver?
and what is he? he's a semigovernment type agent who works for the phoenix foundation supposedly
and his big thing is that he can take little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder
so he does all kinds of strange things like that
boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a seven forty seven out of it
see what we can come up with do you like the news shows twenty twenty sixty minutes those kind of things?
I used to watch sixty minutes as a matter of fact and I used to like the show very much
but unfortunately I find getting rid of your t v set you do throw out some of the baby with the bath water some of the little things
and I just decided I had to do that I think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it I could just sit mindlessly in front of a t v set for hours
and I just realized I was sort of like an alcoholic if I didn't get the booze out of the house I was going to drink
I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that I have my favorite shows and I usually make time in my day or my week to watch those
but for the most part I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they're up
because they're I guess that falls and one of my other favorite shows is sesame street because of the kids I like that real well
when my kids were little I did have a t v set and I did watch a lot of sesame street and a lot of electric company as well I don't think they have that on anymore
that would be a shame I haven't seen the electric company in a long time I remember it when I was younger catching it on p b s but I don't think they show it must be in maybe it's in if it was in repeats but they're not making new ones
I haven't seen it in a long time but sesame street is still really good
how about mister rogers is he still around? they still show mister rogers I don't think he's making new ones but they repeat all the old ones I see I see so that's still a real good show too I that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the t v on
sesame street comes on from nine to ten which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go so it's the timing of it is good besides what's on
I figure your children are preschool? I have two little ones so they like that
I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon they come on both they come on from nine to ten and then from five to six
they just repeat over again which is also
another thing that's good about it when it comes on right in the dinner hour I can feel like I can let them sit in front of the t v and watch and they're watching something worthwhile while I can make dinner and do things I need to do without them under foot
with little kids the t v set really is a I used it as a pacifier
I'm not sure it was that great for my children but they turned out okay so it didn't hurt them any
some shows are good for I think some star trek I for the imagination of it all the idea I think that's one of the things I like about star trek
and is the for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff I don't let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do in the future perhaps this will be possible that kind of thing
I think we've covered most of my favorite t v shows
I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time let's see how about man from uncle?
I do seem to is that the one where he always got this tape recording that self destructed? that's mission impossible
mission that's right mission impossible I used to watch that in fact I can still remember a couple of those they were I thought those were very good they always have I've seen some of them on repeats
that they always had a good plot
it kind of kept you guessing on what was going to happen next
you how they're going get out of their latest scrape
I do remember that and I remember as a kid my parents watching the ed sullivan show that was really the big deal in our household was the ed sullivan show every saturday night?
I guess it was a saturday night and I went to see the movie the doors a couple of days ago and they had this scene portraying the doors appearance on the ed sullivan show they even had somebody portraying ed sullivan and it was very very funny
I think it was the funniest part of that movie
I don't know was there any I remember the milton berle show even I was I'm not old enough to recall that one
I guess I have to admit that I am my t v viewing started sort of mid sixties so
I see my folks I'm not even sure if we had one when I was really little that may be why they probably didn't have a t v until I got to be grade school or so
and the shows that I like now they wouldn't let me watch I had to catch them all on repeats like star trek they thought that was much too violent for small children so
I ended up watching a lot of these things on repeats in the afternoons or something
that's interesting I think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv people were just as violent before t v was invented maybe even more so
but I guess that's a different topic isn't it? probably so I think that's about covered it for me so I think I'll say good bye and we'll talk another time perhaps
it was nice talking to you tell me where you're calling from I'm calling from garland texas garland texas
I'm in where are you from?
I'm in raleigh north carolina I didn't know they did it long distance
I hope they're trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different dialects
it was nice talking to you same here
do you do artistic painting?
I do tole painting you do?
I really love the tole painting I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor I would like to learn that someday but right now my passion is tole painting do you do a lot of it?
I took one class about three or four years ago and I've done a little
but it takes a lot of time it does it is real time consuming and do you sell your projects?
mostly I have just given them away as gifts
I've done perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and on and on just things like that but I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job where do you work at?
I just work at stop and shop out there in ogden so do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique?
I've wanted to do that but just haven't mass produced enough to do that
I have five children of my own so it's that keeps you busy
they keep me busy and tole painting is just something I do in my spare time so have you tried any of the do you cut out your own projects?
I have my own saws and so I really enjoy doing that do you ever spray your projects with a base coat first or do you brush it on?
I brush it on I haven't tried a spray varnish I use just a wood sealer
I just bought a spray gun one of those high volume low pressure spray guns
and I do a lot of woodworking and that's what I bought it for do you?
but I haven't used it yet
that'ud probably give you a smoother finish wouldn't it?
what type of woodworking do you do? fine furniture do you?
that's why I bought the sprayer is to finish my projects
that's my worst part of my woodworking I get so sick of making
but it's hard to finish it but spraying does put on a nicer finish
that is interesting what kind of equipment do you have? for woodworking?
let me see table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers and t's about it
it sounds like you're really into it that is nice it is
I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw and I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router the band saw is really nice I have an inca I don't know if you've ever heard of those
but it's nice to have the right equipment
that makes it easier doesn't it?
have you sold any of your furniture or just not mostly I do like you do give it away as gifts
but making my own furniture
that's interesting did you take classes to learn how to do that? just in junior high
and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment kept up with that
so yours is mostly just a hobby too then
that is interesting I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture but mostly just do more the shelves and
the woodworking for your tole painting
so it's fun I guess I'll let you go now
they come on we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us they do?
so this is my first one you're probably a veteran at this
it has been really fun I've enjoyed this like I say I've made a couple of calls to texas and just talked to all different kinds of people
so I think you'll enjoy doing it it's fun sounds fun where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here?
there's a shop in roy that I really love and it's there by the copper mill restaurant used to be the hayloft I am not we live in roy but we is it on nineteen hundred?
let's see I'm trying to think of the name I know where fifty six hundred south is
I don't right off is that ben franklin then? ben franklin
this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to one that kind of comes up when you've lost the other subjects
as I was sitting there I thought the weather's been perfect I don't know much to say about it it's for the balloon festival here in plano it was just gorgeous I'm from plano also are you? it couldn't have been better
that's right it didn't foul one launch and that's kind of unusual and it's kind of cold in the mornings so you dress up warm but by
that's the only thing wrong I can find with it
I just got back from dayton I spent the weekend in ohio with my family how fun
and the trees are changing color there I miss that
so that as soon as we got out of the cloud cover of course it wasn't sunny like it is here it was real gray
but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and I saw all those trees it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall I don't complain weather wise though because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning
and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies I guess you have to take some things and leave some things
that's right I'm from utah area and they have tons of canyons where the leaves change and they're gorgeous
you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area we did that when we lived up in michigan we went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure
and then on leaf weekends which is this time of the year it's bumper to bumper traffic people as whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road it's kind of hazardous for driving
that's for sure but I can't complain I don't know if I've been spoiled I've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal we've only lived here a couple of years
I think it is and my family said that in ohio there was just an article on at the t v news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and the first frost everything just happened three weeks early this year we'll have to see how it goes a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week or last week so just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring
I don't have to live through any of those really a bad nothing comparable to what you've had before
I've only been here just a short time too so I haven't been through any of those either so I have in michigan but in michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on you're right
so as I understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and close businesses they get ice and no one can drive on ice
we used to think they were pansies but then when you decided what ice was
the real definition of ice so I think we've discussed it good enough today
I think so it was good talking to you it was nice talking with you maybe we'll get the next time take care
I would like to talk about just briefly what happened over there in saudi arabia in the political context I think it's refreshing to see the support that the president got from the american people
it we I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed that seemed that every other time a president tried to get support for an action like president carter and his thing with the hostage crisis he always did it through rhetoric
and this time president bush did it through action and he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support
or he left almost no alternative that's right
and it was very interesting how he did it and I'm an air force officer so it was interesting for me
I'd certainly I think it's great that all the support I have friends of mine from the air I'm an engineer and work in the rolm laboratory
but other guys here on base this is a b fifty two base where I work so we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there
and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it that's great if you remember the vote in the congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close
it was and if if my memory serves me right I believe a majority of democrats may even have opposed it it was
I'm I don't know the exact figure but I would imagine that because of how close the vote was almost certainly would have to be just based on the disparity of democrats and republicans in congress he'd think that it would have to have been that's right
and I this whole thing now with all the political cartoons on the democrats and how they're in a sad way for ninety two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
especially the ones that came out and said come on guys let's talk about this little while longer
how many years are we going to wait and what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time
I think that was all those factors played a part in the no doubt
everyone was discussing whether we should wait longer but I know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer but I think we were genuinely concerned about their military capability and I think we over estimated it but still we were really highly concerned about it I think so too
and we were worried that they were getting dug in and they were
and in fact they were so well dug in that when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time
they couldn't it's true they saddam thought he had the whole thing figured out to which way we were coming and what our doctrine was had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor
that's right that's true that's interesting I think this political situation over there now is it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether this opposition will today the turks agreed to support the kurds which is something they've never done before and this interesting
the arabs all of a sudden are cheering for baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the israelis so it's like baker is really not very much pro israel
I and did you know john sununu is half arab?
I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago
because I used to live in massachusetts but in fact when he was governor of new hampshire I believe
new hampshire I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for israel a few years back
and now he is a conservative but he is not a conservative that favors israel
and that concerns me greatly
I don't I'd certainly support israel in their policy in defending themselves and in their handling of their foreign policy I think the stand they have or the way the command respect I support that I think that is a positive thing for them after thousands of years they I think they in when they became a country they more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore and they didn't have much choice they could either fight or die
and so I lost my train of thought here so so I can't say that I'm pro israel or anti israel I'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region and looks that the joining of forces for this desert shield and desert storm thing ended up being a positive thing it is a positive thing however every time an organization such as the p l o says we'll see if we can work with israel then they get embarrassed every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them
and so you basically have mutually exclusive interests either israel is going to occupy the area or the arabs are going to occupy the area and I'm just not sure that there's going to be any easy permanent solution
somebody's going to and I think that's the problem the p l o has is that whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something they're going to try to make some peace the end result is that there so many factions of them some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split they end up becoming divisive themselves
I it's interesting it is
I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months but that's I commend israel for their restraint in not responding to the scud attacks
I know that is almost that's absolutely unprecedented that was an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the president and the state department
and that's never happened before
and I don't know if it will ever happen again but may not it's been fun I enjoyed talking with you
I guess maybe the computer will pair us up together another time you never know
have you ever been drug tested? that's a good question I had a job I had to go get a blood test for
and they did a full blood screen on me but they didn't call that a drug test so I think they checked for drugs they just don't tell you they did
I've had two or three drug tests that I had to get before I could start working at different jobs
I had one at t I and then one at another engineering company and I don't mind them I don't do drugs anyway I guess if I did maybe I would but I don't know I know a girl that she's a nurse and they get drug tested randomly I've never been randomly drug tested
but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it I guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
I guess so I guess so do you think that it's right? I come from kind of a biased opinion because I'm a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor
and I've done employee assistant work and I know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related
and it's in the billions of dollars every year and the only way that they can prevent that is making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free
that's true and the problem in the work place is that people are if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever you can come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it
but ends up costing the company lots and lots of money that's true
I believe it's right especially for certain jobs
I think anyone in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that
I think they should be randomly drug tested
I believe full force in that
I don't know that I believe every secretary in every company needs to be
secretaries aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so I don't know I'm kind of biased too because I don't do drugs and so I really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because I have nothing to worry about
so I guess that's kind of biased I think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired
it does because generally you know it you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job
that's true and like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her co workers then it's still a problem that's true but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before
and it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything and they happen to be tested monday morning and they could be fired for that? that's kind of unfair also I guess it comes with the turf
I guess so I guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences and in terms of drugs they're illegal so you're breaking the law anyway that's true
that's true probably the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of assessing for alcohol that's true and that's probably the biggest problem there is
I think so more than drugs and I know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab
they would pay for an alcohol
but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation I guess that's one of the positive things that have come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something they will give you an opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job that's true and I I think that's fair
I think the company benefits in the long run
that's true that's about all I have to say on it
what kind of testing do they do when you went?
it's a urine test urine screen and they it was really very official you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours
and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that
so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's or something that happens I know
it's hard to believe it happens a lot
but I guess it does there are people that pay other people to help them out I know I'm amazed at the things people will do
it is amazing I guess there are people that do that and those are expensive tests I'm glad I never had to pay for one
it depends really on how strong a test it is they've got different degrees as far as how far back they can check
I guess so they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests they've some companies that are doing hair tests
that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test back a certain period of time because some of the residue ends up in your hair follicles how weird I didn't know that it's kind of
that's weird hair follicles are just dead protein and they
and it's apparently almost like a calendar they've got it pretty precise now they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and that type of thing that's wild
it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body so I guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that that's true
that's true I'm glad I never had to do it by giving blood I can't stand the thought of giving blood
I can't even do it for wadley even though it's a good cause
I enjoyed talking to you I did too thank you
what do you think about it?
most of the stuff up until now in the recent months I don't have any problem with I don't either
it's it I don't think it's going to change very much but
I agree with that as far as the mess that's developing as a result as a country the united states I think our hands are tied as far as any further involvement until the u n sanctions it
in fact it really was to begin with
and I heard a comment on the radio this morning that it gets to a point where if enough people are going to be slaughtered over there over the internal problems somebody may step in again
but I really think it's a u n issue at that point because it is internal
the funny thing I find about american opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the american public goes crazy
and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in iraq they're going crazy
that's right that's right you can't please them one way or the other
and I think that I agree with you this is exactly the right course that's an internal problem to iraq it has nothing to do with us
and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved then it's nobody's business that's right
these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time all the time
some of them have been going on for tens of years if I understand it right in places like the sudan and
and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years
and it's going to continue
that's right as long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time
that's absolutely right the kurds have tried it before they've gotten their butts kicked
and this is just another time that it's happening
that's absolutely right they'll regroup out in the mountains and they'll try it again in a couple of years
it was it's a very opportune moment for them to try you and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it
but I'm not real sure that we promised them anything
I that would have been stupid
and I don't think we did it everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right I don't think they would have done that
I agree but it really doesn't make any difference this is just another chapter in middle eastern history
and there are many of them there's no doubt about it the british occupied the place the french occupied it we've done it it's happened so many times this is really nothing special
and so many of the conflicts really don't have a basis in politics or human rights or anything like that it's religious based that's right it's mostly religious anyway
and by self proclamation this is a holy war and it is right
and then we go on from there and
it's a mess it's there's no doubt about it and I think one of the big problems looking at it from the american public's standpoints they don't understand the middle easterners
that's right they don't understand what their politics really isn't politics it's religion couched as politics
and there's a big difference
we sit there and we think that they think the way we think
and that's a big mistake because they don't you bet
you bet because there's a complete different set of values
there's different value placed on human life possessions and everything else
and what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases that's it a lot of the time I was stationed in turkey for a year and a half
and it was tough understanding those folks
they're so completely different culturally and socially and religiously it was very strange I believe it it was very interesting
I can believe that I don't claim to have an in depth understanding by any means but I I think some of these people that they claim as middle eastern experts don't have a clue sometimes
that's probably true that's probably true they sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert
I'm not real sure that's appropriate
that's a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field
but I sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too
and we make experts by reading books
that's right and the japanese and the germans and everybody else make experts by doing
I guess you work for t I
that's right so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else
that's an everyday occurrence it's like our car industry the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the japanese came into it and helped us out
I agree it's an overall problem in this country understanding foreign cultures or even accepting them
and it bites us over and over again the and until we start changing our educational system we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later
looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the math and the science and everything that's right it's not us
that's right we've got folks running around here who get degrees in basket weaving and underwater psychology or some ridiculous stuff like that
and where are the engineers coming from?
they're coming from various places and a lot of them are going back there
that's my roommate is a he's getting his doctorate in industrial it's not industrial engineering it's human factors
his degree was in industrial engineering
I see and he's from the philippines
and the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it
he has no intention of going back to the philippines because there's no jobs
but I see it all too often we've got loads of foreign students
and they're coming here going after the hard degrees and then they're going back to korea and japan and hong kong and everywhere else
and they're applying it there
that's right and I don't know to me it's amazing I don't know what we're going to do as a country we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
every the country's got a problem with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that
and the long range views are just kind of become a thing of the past you
and I don't think there can be anymore long range planning I think it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike
here's a crisis let's plug it up
I don't know I don't know what the answer is it's far beyond me
that's for sure that's the way things have gotten all we can do is keep plugging
I wonder I read in the paper just last week I b m's unveiling their new laptop computer
at a price tag of six thousand bucks I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
I have the I b m p s two
but I'm sorry I got it
it's slow there are many better machines on the market right now for a
the only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school
and I saved forty eight percent
so I said if I can have an I b m for forty eight percent discount I'll take it
but up to that point I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name that's right but
that's absolutely right you watch just sure as anything the japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it
the unfortunately the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get something in your hands
it's already outdated
it's obsolete and we fight that battle every day here at work I can imagine
and years ago I remember when I had a t I ninety nine put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other
and things just kept changing so much and I kept getting rid of them and I finally said you can't do this
that's right you've got to buy something and stick with it so I just
that's right at an opportune time I got one that suited my needs and I've just stuck with it the only thing I've done to it is just add a mouse and a hard drive
and that's all I plan to do of course I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line I got the model twenty five
so I'm stuck with six forty but I'm not a power user so it doesn't matter
that's the key whatever works for you
and if it does the job then that's what you need my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
he's looking now to get rid of his he's got a three eighty six and wants to get a four eighty six this kind of stuff do you have any pets now?
I sure do I have a cat and a dog named joey joey the dog is joey? the cat is
he's the little boy pomeranian
and we just got a new addition to the family we also have a fish it's a mud dog I beg your pardon
it's a mud dog it's a cross between a catfish and a salamander
did you all catch it or
we have a cat stripper
the mud dog did did you catch the fish?
we had a friend give it to us and it's all alone in that aquarium
we'd like to get him a friend but we haven't found one yet so how about you do you have any pets? at the present time I have two dogs
what kind? an english setter that's the white dog with the feathers and it has yellow spots on it which they call liver spots
and that's a male and I have a wonderful female lab black lab
how long have you had them quite a long time probably five or six years and unfortunately the black lab that's a female it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had an when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having problems limping and so forth and she has hip dysplasia
and it's in that breed
but now I think there are tests that can be conducted to tell whether or not the puppies have it
but I think I don't know apparently they've been so inbred or what but
is that right? I'm not sure that's the situation but it for those dogs that are registered and if you should have one that also has hip dysplasia you can not breed it
I had no idea I didn't even know that but she's wonderful
our dog joey has a back problem what are the symptoms?
he's got a bad back but he's seven I guess he's almost eight years old
he just he doesn't he rolls he doesn't like to roll over
you just when you touch him a certain way on the back
but otherwise he can jump just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way I have had just wonderful luck with this lab when let's see winter before last we would bring her in when it was cold
and she wouldn't I the next morning you want to take them out and she wouldn't I couldn't get her up without picking her up which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds
I bet until if I allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon
anyway I met my son's college roommate is a vet and he said let's give her some race horse shots and in I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this because you all the time run into people with problems
that's when we lived in oklahoma so he gave this dog a series of it's they give it to race horses to get rid of cartilage
and it's called anyway it's a series of six shots once a week and then I noticed after two shots she was
do you have to give those? I could have but I can't give a shot
I believe me I understand I took her from enid oklahoma to oklahoma city every week for six weeks
and after the second shot she was significantly better then I didn't notice any improvement till after the sixth one
and ever since and he said a booster every year or two maybe every six months or something like that
and when I notice in the winter when it's worse it's cold weather and so forth then I have gotten a booster for her but not many people in this part of the country know anything about
I've had to get it from oklahoma they've heard about it but they've really never used it
I've never heard anything about it either so dogs that get down in the hips I think german shepherds do it and probably large dogs
and it's just wonderful
does he get is he an inside dog also
or does he just run out in the backyard? is he fenced in? we're living now in an area where we're in the woods and we take walks I just don't let them go away from me
but we take walks through the woods twice a day
that's nice and I can over do it on her
but anyway at least she can go and she's not limping along and all that
tell me about your cat
stripper he started out being a little orphan and we took him in and he's about two years old now and he loves his treats both joey and stripper get treats and let's see and is stripper an inside cat or outside?
he's outside and he's got a way to get in
he's got free access of a window we like to keep open
so he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to of course that's nice they
joey on the other hand is a little different he has to go out whenever we ask him and when we ask him he barks he'll either bark for food or he'll bark to go out and he'll tell you which one he wants he's been through obedience school he just can he has been trained and you've kept it up haven't you
it is wonderful I have some neighbors across the field and they when we first moved here when the dogs and I didn't we have a very nice kennel and everything but since I didn't want to I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while
so I kept watch and never let them get away but now every couple weeks one would slip away and my neighbor said to me I noticed those dogs are so well trained anytime they hear your voice they come so that made me very proud
have we been talking five minutes? I'm not for sure I'm not either but
I think maybe we have but it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure
have you ever done this before?
I haven't ever called I've put in the paper work I just never made the call
I didn't know if they stop you when the time is up or they don't I glanced at the clock when we started and I think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something but one day I was talking to a lady about gardening and I love gardening and she did too and after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape
at least you know you did your part but it's been so much fun too talk
how did you get into this my best friend in virginia's daughter is a part of this project in texas
I see and so she knew that I had the time and would enjoy it that's true
I but I have a hard time getting anybody because do you work
I do and probably just got home
so during the day I I and I understand also they want men
I was going to tell you the same thing they're really looking for a lot more men to participate my husband does does he I need to
I've got some applications I need to hand them out but this is a great project that they're working on and it's really going to lead the way for a lot of applications and development in the voice area I think so too and I haven't helped them out on men particularly but my husband probably has made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time
I try to make them during the day but nobody's home
this is the perfect time for me
maybe I'll get you next time it so much fun to talk to you
have a good one you too
what do you do to exercise?
I weight train three days on and one day off
I ride bicycles fifteen twenty miles maybe three times maybe four times a week I play basketball couple times a week I play softball one night a week that's what I do
what about yourself? that's pretty impressive I guess I bicycle the amount varies as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week
I guess a play softball one night a week and I backpack a lot over the summer
that's about the extent of it I don't do any of those things particularly for exercise but I guess the bicycling is the one thing I'll sort of do if I feel like I need to go exercise but I do it mostly for fun
what do you ride a bunch of hills or pretty flat? it varies out near my house is pretty hilly but sometimes I bike to work which is about a fifteen mile trip each way and that's mostly flat
how long does that take you to get to work? about forty five fifty minutes
how does that work out with storing your bike and showering and all that? it can be a pain basically I work on a campus so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the campus to the gym use the shower there
but it's enough of a pain that I did it consistently one year I would commute every day but it just became such a pain we're talking forty five fifty minutes for biking and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind and then another half an hour to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff
it was a big hunk of the day and then of course another hour to get back home so I've been doing that less and concentrating more on light biking when I get home on the evening and then some more on the weekends
do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there? not so much I guess mostly I bike on my own I've got a touring bike though I haven't gone on any extended trips with it
how about you what kind of biking do you do?
actually my wife just got me into it and I did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas the cooper clinic
and I learned all the health benefits of I was a solid weight trainer
and all I did was weights and aerobic exercise and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it so once I got into this internship I learned all the physiological advantages to it
so I began a program probably three or four weeks ago and I did my first bike rally this saturday I did forty miles
and that's the longest I've ever ridden so far I usually fifteen or twenty
and it was kind of hilly and it was pretty tough but I'm looking at doing a lot more of it because my wife is really into it I see
and I kind of held her back a little bit this weekend she wanted to go go go but she wanted to stay with me it's good to have a partner
it really is are you think of doing any centuries or
that would be cool sometime if I could work up to that I just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more touring from vermont or that kind of thing
people seem to get into different aspects one is more of a distance and one's more just they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour
I've never really looked into that that's my wife would just love that
and I may do that sometime there again I'm just kind of a fledgling into this
it's kind of funny I called this number and I was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
around texas you got about five or six if you live around the dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because they're really into it that's nice
bicycling is really big here I didn't know that until I came down here and kind of caught the fever
because I lived in indiana all my life and you may see one or two guys on a bicycle that or above the age of fifteen or something
but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here I'm not sure why that is generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less maybe it's because of the winters or maybe just because there's a lot more flat lands out in the west
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
there's a lot of bikers around here it's really neat
there are a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff little texas bicyclist is a little newspaper that comes out every month
it's free just go to the bike shop and pick it up and it's got all the rides coming up so I guess I'm going to be busy about every saturday this summer going to a different ride that's terrific
see a little bit of texas I've never seen before
so how long have you been biking? I guess as an adult for just about the past three years or so I guess last time I did it before that was college which was about ten years ago
and I guess I just never really thought about it much for a while until I suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot and so I thought I'd try it too
have you ever had a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking to see if it I haven't
because from what I understand it really improves your cholesterol
and it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is low cardiovascular fitness and also the cholesterol
it gives you increased h d ls and decreases your l d ls that's great
so I've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse
it gets it down to about forty that's good
you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week?
that's hard core on average
when do you get to begin with the winters and all that? what time of the year do you usually embark on your do you ride inside if you can't ride outside? I'm not that hard core there are some people in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow they've got a mountain bike with the big knobby tires
and I don't do that I pretty much lay off for the winter I was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter because it will help your balance when you're indoor training
but I just more or less stocked an exercise bike and that kind of thing but winters are kind of a problem so I'm more or less out of shape now that I've been biking this year for just a couple of weeks
but up here it's only stopped snowing since then
but it's pretty good it's the main thing for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like exercise and a chore I'll lay off it more
so you change up your routes a lot and keep a I try to go someplace pretty different every week I rotate around about four different routes from my house or I'll sometimes come in the school it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path because it's along the erie canal up here
what school is it? university of rochester
so it's fairly picturesque
so it's a good ride as long as you're not doing it every day it's a good ride
that's true sounds neat
it's kind of I was wondering if I was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week that's motivating
that's really good good talking to you it was good talking to you
and keep up the good work you too take care
do you do a lot of cooking in your family? I do some every now and then I work and my wife's home during the day so she usually ends up doing most of it
when I was single we used to always cook around the house
do you like to cook I really like it
there's a few dishes I grew up with having polish and ukrainian food
and my wife she likes italian and stuff
so we definitely have different tastes so
but that's neat though because you get to have different stuff
I'm a pretty bad cook I'm pretty bad my husband is really good he put himself through college working in restaurants
and he's much better cook than I am so when I was home I still cooked a lot and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff and now I went back to work about a year and a half ago so one of the things that he took over was the cooking and the kids are thrilled they're really happy that I don't cook anymore they're preferring it now
they say dad let dad cook mom let him do it but so do you have kids? you obviously have one two
you have two one is nine months and the other is two and a half
two and half that's the hard part is cooking with kids around
I was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it or are you not at that stage yet? it does
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we eat
and my sister she's the master of the fast order grill
she makes six different meals but
like to have one thing one likes chicken nuggets the other one like hot dogs
I couldn't and then she makes noodles with soy sauce or whatever so all things
I couldn't do that I but our favorite let me think I was thinking of the one recipe that we made I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy and that was scallop what's that
it has a french name it basically means that it has a swiss cheese cream sauce with it and you pour it over rice
what is that saint jack or something
scallops saint something or I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore
but it was basically just ground up swiss cheese and then standard cream sauce base and then the scallops
with scallops and it sounds sort of funny but it tastes really good
I'm from new england so we had a lot of seafood before we moved down here
and that sounds delicious to me
that sounds great but
we're just thinking of having a dinner party we went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game they had a murder mystery
and you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
and it was really fun and so we were going to try doing it ourselves but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game so I was thinking there's this beef bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good
and then you can make that ahead and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready
so that's that's another thing I have a problem with my wife
she doesn't like the beef dishes she likes the chicken and fish
and like I said we always ate beef and pork a lot so
I know my husband did too his parents are austrian and they always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table red meat plenty of good red meat
my dad could eat a meal with out any vegetables at all
and susan's they had meatless meals
my dad wouldn't know what to do
so do you course she grew up catholic so they sort of come with the
they did the there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have
that you do that's just part of it
my family didn't but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly he never
there was dishes that he really enjoyed eating
there were several things that he liked but it never was really something that he would have chosen it's just that I cooked so he had to put up with it
but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans I tried it once or twice and he just could not eat it so I never I had I was limited I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans but it's hard to get a protein content up then
that's true I like them every now and then for a change it's nice
some of the stuff is good but it was a tremendous amount of cooking because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete
and we had little kids at the time when I was home with them and it was just so much cooking I don't like to cook
and I'm not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much cooking so I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there he's all done
he's set I set him down
do you like to bake at all or do you get into that we used to do that my mom used to go crazy every sunday until my dad blew up
after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the navy she stopped doing it
but she used to have two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls every week
and the sticky buns would last three or four days and that would be it
then be gone I know that's the thing about baking I don't mind baking at all and I can do a pretty good pie we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother and my mother taught me how to make it
I can make a pretty mean pie but I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening we had the same kind of problem if you make homemade bread
it's supposed to save you money but you eat three times the amount of bread that you usually eat it tastes so good we had that bread that was you ever seen the starter bread I can't remember what it's called they call it the amish bread here but
it's made with you just leave it out
and you let it spoil sort of
I've heard of it but I've never done it
that sounds pretty good it tasted pretty good
but it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad and then you add all these other ingredients to it but
and then you make the bread but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else and that's how they continue the thing
I know it always sounded I don't know how safe that was I know it sounded strange to me too I figure you're baking it so
that's true that's got to kill anything I guess but I'll talk to you later
where are you calling from by the way texas plano where?
plano in texas plano
are you in texas? falls church virginia
it sounds so close I know we've got a good connection must be a t I connection
I thought for sure you were in dallas or something I talked to so many people from texas that's where practically everybody I talked to is from
I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state
they're trying to get all different amount of people my husband is from richmond and I went to u v a that's where we went
I went to school at west virginia university
you did but I grew up right here in falls church right outside d c
we'd like to get back over to the east coast I'll tell you
it's nice over there it's sort of funny I have people that want to go to dallas
one of my friends here he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to dallas saying how
things are doing pretty good down here we tried to move over to raleigh last year and there was such little going on in raleigh you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there so we decided we'll try in a couple of years but business is we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash
you probably could you probably could northern virginia
it's good talking to you nice talking to you too take care
wonderful touch tone telephone there what kind of books do you enjoy reading?
I have a wide variety of hobbies therefore my reading pleasures are quite wide I get a charge out of texas highway which is very colorful and not being a native of texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to find out about the different areas of the state by reading it
I've read that one too I only had a subscription once but my mother always gave me hers and I really enjoyed all the little things that you find out about texas
absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can set up little trips and day trips and things it's pretty neat I like photography magazines I don't take a subscription or anything like that things being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of building magazines and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and kind of strange because it's not unusual to see an engineering manual or something laying around the house
and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh to keep active on it but
how about yourself? I have an interest in art so I frequently purchase and read books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment
that's great and I guess I like a variety of things lots of fiction type books right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about the mardi gras in new orleans and its history
that's fairly interesting
I bet that would be rather interesting that's self improvement that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement how about you? I hate to I do
we have these classes we attend management classes and they give you books and the last book I read was at america's service by carl albrecht it talks about who the customer is and being customer oriented which falls in line with the t I culture here at texas instruments
one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer you're my customer I'm your customer sort of thing
every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about better outlooks on things and the philosophy of pat hagerty and these kind of mind stimulating philosophy type which all betters yourself
maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement
they are but I don't label it as such
like what for example I don't know I have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things but they would be things on how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself getting yourself in gear to sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do convincing you that you need to get on with it
how about items like the one minute manager which used to be a big
so those are self improvements
our supervisor subtly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know by a man named doctor bittel b I t t e l
and it's a very layman's approach towards managing different types of people and the very last chapter is how to manage engineers
so it's interesting here again it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of mechanical stuff and it's really excellent fast reading but as you say sometimes it's difficult to know if it's I think if somebody would say read these ten books because these are self improvements I would probably be turned off to them
if he casually just walked into it and put down a stephen king book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested I don't know I'm not sure I could take too much of stephen king that's a little heavy for me
they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies but they're always challenging to get through one of them
I have a hard time finishing books I guess I also have been reading a lot of things on quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work
in quality especially now days that's almost everything that comes across the airways you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other but I think sometimes the word is a little over used exactly right but
I think we name drop it a little too much and don't fully understand what it is we're saying I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and all that kind of rolls in together there
but that's just kind of part of it any other comments
not that I can think of I think I'm under my quota a little bit I need to probably make a phone call or two we just started
this is true I've enjoyed it you too and have a good day go ahead
we're going to compare notes
I often desire to exercise often believe I should and rarely do don't do it
I tell you I firmly believe in exercising I think it's a I do it every day on a regular basis I
what sort of regiment do you have? I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles but this time of year you can't get much biking in but every morning I use this president's council of physical fitness and it's worth doing and you can do it anywhere I travel quite a bit in my business
and you can do it wherever you're at and if you do it I do it every morning usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get dressed to go to work
and now what I do I've done this for fifteen years so you don't start at this kind of regiment
I so what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do and you'll hurt yourself every it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time but I do twenty five where you have your arms above your head and your body twisters touch left and right toe
and I do ten right and left trunk twisters
and I do about sixty leg thrust type things
and I do twenty leg lifters on each side when you're laying on the floor
and then I do fifty push ups and do a hundred sit ups and then I do about
you do all of this in fifteen minutes? and then thirty if you did football like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you
prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing and that takes maybe about thirteen minutes in the morning
what keeps you doing that I sometimes start much more modest efforts but I give up I just find them boring hard to find the time for it on a given day
and years ago I used to referee football
and to stay in condition I did that just as a normal basis
and I tell you just by doing it example this summer I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be so I increased I do three hundred sit ups a day now but not in the morning I do a hundred then and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed
I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles
and you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't within reason you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being
and I just you're ready to go at a I think it's really important
whenever I do it I feel good that I have done good because it seems right and good because it has good effects
but it's this maintaining a regular habit that I just can't seem to do that's why chuck I think if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things where you can make excuses like
I like biking and during the summer I'll do at least seventy five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty but you can't
there's excuses weather
or you don't have time or something like that but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour and you get up a half hour earlier
and once you start getting into that one you just feel good
and you look a whole lot better
does your wife participate in any of this or unfortunately not and there's no way I can get her to
it's something you either just really want to do it or you can't talk anyone into it if you don't like to exercise it isn't going to happen
I sure wish she would she's unfortunately overweight but she's a wonderful woman and no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it
I keep saying if somebody else would do it with me little bit of peer pressure would help considerably
but you seemed to have solved that problem without any external help no problem at all
and if you get one of these mats go to a store they normally have these exercise things these a b c s of physical fitness on them
one of my kids got me one of those for christmas one year and
what's this mat it's just an exercise mat that rolls up so you can put it up just in the corner
is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it you can do that
it's that kind of half inch of foam or something but it doesn't it's a foam thing
and it's just about six feet long rolls up
and I don't take it on trips with me you could but I don't mind if I do sit ups I'll throw a towel down or something
so you don't have the abrasive
so we started recording already?
I guess I don't know it's the first time I've made a phone call on it so you pressed one?
so I guess we're supposed to start talking what kind of books do you read?
I read a lot of steven king dean r koontz some danielle steel
my aunt got me hooked on those so I so it's mostly all novels? they're all novels
I'll read some classic too like what?
like the graduate by steinbeck I'll I like that I like steinbeck a lot
a rose family by faulkner that's one of my favorites I have never read a lot of faulkner
and this is more of a play or something that it was from that I saw and I read the book from that and by the way my name's bill I'm from north carolina I'm doug I'm from pennsylvania
I let's see what kind of books do you like to read? a bunch of stuff fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones and I don't really like the six hundred page long stephen king novels and all that
I really have to be in the mood
I read one maybe once a year
I'm not as I like richard broudigan a lot
I've never read anything by him he's dead now but he was really a pretty amazing writer he wrote books that were pretty short and pretty easy to read written at a third grade level or whatever
but they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny he wrote trout fishing in america
so that's and I read a lot of non fiction books too let's see
I like to read a lot of non fiction history civil war era and that kind of thing
I found that real interesting I'm reading the lion and the wind right now and that was on t v what's that?
it was during teddy roosevelt's time and about a american woman that got kidnapped in morocco
this is when they were having their revolution or whatever
and teddy roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man
surprised me I had no idea that he was like that how crazy?
just one quote that he had was that he thought the america's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle
and it should be a grizzly bear because
the grizzly and stuff like that so it's I saw the movie and that's what made me want to read the book
candice bergen was in the movie I'm a real big fan of hers so I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things
I like to read some of the philosophy stuff
let's see and even like reading some new age things things that I don't quite believe in here on my shelf I have a book called journeys out of the body
I think that it's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that I'm fascinated by that
I'm fascinated by that
that and even stuff about not ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses
I like I'm kind of a doubting thomas and I like to read stuff like that some of it really freaks me out
and I like to read some self help books like I read dianetics once I got past all the gibberish on it did you like it?
it was okay it took me a while to really get into it it didn't help me that much I see
but I think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways
then I one real interesting book I read recently was when I was looking for a job I read how to get the job that you wanted and it had real good tips and it and I got the job that I wanted by applying the methods that
do you want to go ahead or
I went to school at madison for two years and they are really big on women's rights and equal treatment
and so I've seen a lot of rallies and things like that but I'm not that liberated my mom is kind of old fashioned
so you pick up some traits from her and stuff but I think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's more of them doing men's fields I like to see that and I don't like to see women waiting on men hand and foot
but I believe in sharing and doing things for each other I do too I like the idea I see a lot more my children I have five children and they're all married
and I love seeing the men help the women so much
and they both cooperate together on I think it's great
me too I hope that happens to me someday I don't mind doing stuff
I have a boyfriend and I got to make him dinner and stuff but he'll help me do the dishes I don't want to expect to help to clean up then after
that's right that's right
I've always taught my men that they better clean up with their women and help them if they did that
and they're good about it but it is neat to see them all work together and a big thing that I see most of the women getting married now have gone back to
they stay at work or go back to work or whatever
and they're well educated
and I believe we'll see a lot more c e o s in companies they're having a fit about how little there are
and I think we'll see a lot more of upper management? then we do now even
I think it'll escalate
and I think black women now in fact I work at a high school
and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted and she's very sharp and I think that and the ethnic thing is a good thing now
me too they're moving them up and they're sharp and they so you're going to see a lot more of that in leadership I believe
I like to see that I think it's really neat to see and all that educated minority person who really knows what they're talking about
and it's just too bad that some people still look down on them just because of their color that's a shame
especially black women
but they wouldn't know what they're doing
but I'm not big on subserving as far as to the men at all
but I never have gone along with that even far back but I was brought up pretty good in a home that years ago my mother was that way the same I my some people say the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs the inside jobs but we never were taught they had to do as much as we did so that was good
same here so I think that's good to keep the equal as far as not necessarily by sex type thing
same here you should be able to accomplish as much and I think the attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you can do it
if he can do it you can do it type thing
I see more men participating in the family things with children helping to take care of them more and doing the jobs equally
what about politics on it?
do you think the political scene?
I'm not that big on politics I'm not that educated on it
I'm I'm kind of disgusted this year because I don't see many women into the political scene and I really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do and even for president and vice president this year
I agree with that there's nobody again I think they're all scared out after what was the lady's name that ran a couple of I forget her name now
I don't know but you know who I mean?
I know who you're talking about she took such a rough go of it and their tax deal and
at least she was strong to try it and
so that's good but I wish they would get some more on that I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about I didn't see any of the women in there
and that disappoints me
and right now I don't think we have too many in the forefront schroeder's about the biggest one in washington
congress woman and other we really
I guess we're going to discuss food and cooking
do you enjoy cooking? sometimes not all the time
I'm kind of that way too I enjoy cooking when I have time
I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday
that's about the same boat I'm in too it gets kind of boring
how big is the family you cook for?
five we have four and two of them are teenage boys
I'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too so are they?
and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have
we have that problem too
but also now it's just the amount that they eat it's just absolutely incredible
my oldest is nine and he already does that does he? and I told him he's going to have to get a part time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat
that's true do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal? favorite recipes that you've come across or
my husband and I our favorite meal is and we do it for special stuff celebrations and we have steak
and he does the steak and then out on the grill?
and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does and it's real good
and I do sauteed mushrooms how so
and asparagus and that's our favorite dinner that sound good I love that my husband really likes seafood
so do we and I think that no matter what I do I don't serve enough of it really to suit him I didn't grow up eating that much seafood and so I don't know it's just kind of not natural to me but I like it
and I don't know one of his favorite things is it's called seafood stew and it's really like a soup that you serve over rice
and it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it and
it's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it? that's kind of louisiana if you do that
I don't know what that
I don't see how you eat that but I don't either but
it is really good and one thing that's good is it makes a large amount and so usually we eat one and I freeze two containers of it
then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice but neither of my kids will eat it
so then they eat a pizza or so it
it defeats the purpose it really does one thing I've run across recently though a friend gave me a recipe that I really like for chicken enchiladas have you made them?
my husband makes those does he
I don't eat enchiladas
I don't like the I don't know I guess it's the texture or something I don't like the taste of enchiladas
but everyone else in my family does these are done with a flour tortilla is that what he uses?
I don't know it's I don't know what I don't know I don't know what it is about the enchiladas I just and I'm the only one including my mom and dad and my brother I'm the only one that doesn't eat it isn't that something?
but my kids love it I was going to say my kids both eat it I guess that's one thing that I particularly like but I think it's good for company too and I've made it a few times and you can make a lot at one time when I needed to make something to give somebody to take over to somebody's house or something else
I've got a chicken casserole that's like that that I've it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family and then
because when I make this chicken casserole it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze
or I give it to my mom and dad if I know we're not going to eat what does it have in it?
it's you can use chicken or turkey because my mom started making it right after thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey
and it's rice and when I do recipes I just throw stuff in I'm not real good about measuring
because I just I do it to taste and sometimes those are the best ones
but it's just chicken it's as much as you want torn up and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery
and that's it and some hard boiled eggs that sounds good
and that's it you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to heat it through
and you sprinkle those toasted onion rings on top of it for the crunchy those are good aren't they? and that's it
and it goes that sounds good
and it's filling because of the rice
you cook the rice before you put it in?
I bet the mayonnaise in there kind of gives it a tang that would be good
it gives it an extra little tang
I guess I would now use the new mayonnaise free
that cholesterol fat free? that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many new things like that because I told my husband this summer I love to eat chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that
and basically it certainly a low calorie good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing
I know and now it's okay and you can even I used to just put a tiny bit in now I'm just putting more and more in
I don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it and it used to be a hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's twelve
I know I just think that's the best thing to have happened I'm just so excited about that
we did the low cal stuff with my kids I don't they get enough sugar and stuff anyway
mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway
and they don't need any added help
so when we're here at home with sweets and stuff we don't really do that much I do a lot of fruits instead of the cakes and the candies and stuff like that
and drink wise they have kool aid milk or water normally
now when they go to their grandmother's house which is every weekend it's a different story all around
that's when they as our family would say pig out that's good
that's exactly what it is one of my boys that's twelve has high cholesterol
have you ever found out about your kids
not yet and my other one does not
year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down I think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol
he's never eaten any eggs he's never had anything but skim milk and I've never bought butter and things like that
but he just left for the doctor again and it's kind of back up so he needs to be careful again
so we've really been talking about the foods for him to be sure to eat
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff and so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days
and all that kind of stuff does really help I think we've probably talked long enough and
this is lois this is lisa
and I called from the t I data base calling instructions I got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though
this is about changes in the women in the
there's really a lot isn't there I think there really is it's kind of an easy thing to talk about
I guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it I think you have to push one and then we can start recording it are you ready now?
like I said I guess it would be the work force as far as changes in the generations I know because I know when my mother was going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and I've never faced that at all
I think now you go to work when they're six weeks old
and you stay there and I feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband I think it's definitely gotten better
I do to much and it's just going to get better
it really is because women are in every field now I can't think of a field that they're not involved in
I can't either not a one and I know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field
I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing
even in washington there seems to be a lot more women involved
hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman
I think that would be the best goal
I do too just your qualifications and that would be it exactly not what color you are how old you are what you're male or female that would be wonderful I guess it's kind of an ideal world though
I kind of think maybe in time that you'll go by social security numbers
and that way they can't say they picked a male over a female female over a male or the way you look or the way you
your age or anything I think that would be a wonderful way to do it
I do to just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you have and then
and then if you get it then also with women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as job sharing
if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or as a matter of fact that's what I'm doing is it
it sure is that would be great
it sure is or a lot of women I know now and one of my supervisors when she went on l o a to have her baby we hooked up a terminal at her house and we could send her messages and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house
I would just take her the actual paperwork once every week or two and that worked out great too
that is and that's a real attractive option if you have the technology for it
all it was was she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office so I think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing? I do do you?
I really do I think it's great do you work half days or half weeks or
one week she'll work three days and I'll work two and the next week I'll work three and she'll work two that's great
and we just share off like that do you get the full benefits?
we get the full benefits that's wonderful
but we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under especially with children and so many things going on that would be great
it really is and that way we're not really missing any thing out of children either way
you have your career and your home life and that would be a nice way especially if you have young children
it is it is both of ours is school age but we don't want to miss any of those p t a s and all of that I think my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that
I think it's great I really
and I look for more of that in the next generation I do too especially as women get up in management and can be in on those decision making when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful
I do too plus I bet it cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to unless you're just really sick or the child's sick
most of the time now it's just the weekend or just forget it I have to plan way in advance because or what I've done is found doctors and dentists office with extended hours
that's been real helpful too my doctor stays open til nine in the evening so that's real helpful so you don't have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour I don't know how many times I've done that to do something post office or the bank or any kind of errand to do so
I think we've really come a long way in that because I guess I take it for granted kind of because I just it's always been that way but I know
but I can remember back growing up my mother it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off I can remember my mother getting in trouble if one of was sick and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything compared to the work that she did
I think there is still some discrimination there where men and women work in the same job I think men get paid more
I do too but I think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but you can see that it's wrong
and you just want to make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward
they really are I think it's getting better not worse I should probably get back to my job I know I know the feeling call again I sure will
do you have any hobbies?
right at the present time nothing real special I kind of like gardening and I'm kind of into camping and vacationing that sort of thing
I don't have any real serious I'm an avid gardener
I think you're I consider that a hobby I don't know they were suggesting handcraft things which
I guess that's a really true hobby but I think anything that you enjoy
it doesn't really have to matter it could be working on cars could be your hobby really
really I kind of enjoy doing that a little bit too
I guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation I don't know I told my husband you go out some to work on the car it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong I says you go pay to have someone do it
because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something
I guess as far north as you are if you like gardening you've still got a couple months to go haven't you? right now we start our seeds inside
that's right you would we'll start them inside and
in cold frames or whatever the we usually start them right in the house
my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck and a wind storm come and knock it down
but she's had really good luck next month actually if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of may you can leave them outside
you might put them in the ground just the first week of june
but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may
I've lived in texas and new mexico most of my life but I did once I spent one winter in north dakota
and I remember that it was on into may before it really started warming up and we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley
so we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts so
because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit?
we are a little lucky my brother lives ten miles from here you're at and he gets frost and his crop gets killed
you're right across the lake from plattsburgh? from plattsburgh air force base but
I had a cousin that was stationed there plattsburgh for a while he remembers lots of snow plattsburgh's kind of a it's depressed economically
when you go across the lake I don't know why we have so much going for us I really don't
I'm just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at digital and they've had layoffs recently but when we got hired here never any layoffs never never
and now we're looking at serious I'm a technician
when they start getting rid of technicians
I'm working for t I texas instruments down here I interviewed with them
but I didn't want to go to texas
even though my mother's people are from georgia
I guess we have to get back to hobbies since
we're getting to where we're straying I guess stick on the subject
interesting thing that I do is with gardening my sister grows flowers that you can dry
and you can make dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with dried red flowers and dried white flowers and eucalyptus
you know what eucalyptus is? it's
it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries it's got a
it's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it but at first I'm why do people like this but it is kind of a nice smell after a while people put them in
I didn't realize what it was for a while I'd walk into a room where some of that and I'd wonder what is that
and then one day I realized that it was eucalyptus it's like a fad thing I don't know I've never heard of it in the last five years I've used so much of it that I hate
is that the stuff that koala bears eat in australia or something? it is
maybe that's why they're so slow I guess they're stoned on the stuff or something it looks really potent stuff
but I think it's the greatest stuff in the world though it's I make all kinds of things with it we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers I almost want to start a business doing it but I'm so timid when it comes to starting a business
that's a big step it is especially with being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end
after a while you make some stuff then you start looking at it go this is kind of ugly
but I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby he does it I wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife because he's a seasonal worker he works in the construction and up here it's almost a pattern and you see your fathers do it then their sons do it what they do is they work construction
then they get laid off for twelve weeks in the winter and this guy was going nuts and his son built him a garage and got him some planers and things and set him up
shapers and planers and routers and he makes all kinds of furniture for his kids
and he makes little kids furniture he gets right into it and
there was a program on t v down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little companies of one and two guys up there this particular one was in maine and new hampshire just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in they may be the same kind of people you're talking about they've got twelve weeks to do something and they're making furniture and just things like that during the winter and then they go off and do other things during the summer it's a really good thing because it's keeping him sane
and plus it's keeping his marriage
plus he's getting on in his years now he's not that old but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost to do something like that
and it's hard work I couldn't imagine taking raw lumber and trying to make something out of it he dowels everything
that would be really say the
man and it's all got to line up it's and I don't think he goofs too much I don't see too much scrap around
that's something our temperatures down here we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties I'm envious
so as far as planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight I was planting some trees out back tonight and it's really nice out tonight is it going to be really dry?
almost hated to come are you I always plant trees in the fall I don't know why the cold weather can kill them
these were trees that wintered but I guess
I don't know where they came from they come out of nurseries mostly in missouri and places like that and they come down here and they'll sit in the nurseries here and they'll go ahead and leaf out so what I'm planting or actually transplanting is trees that are already leafed out that's good I guess they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall all
mostly I think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall let them winter through the fall
but down here it's done both ways it just kind of depends on what you're planting but all the shrubs and and when you have time to do it
my sister does flower gardens she gets right into it
she spends lots of money on them and I guess a lot of people do do that they landscape their whole house with flower gardens
she's got just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch tree bark all over her lawn
during the summer down here the normal kind of flowers there's very few of them that will really do well everything does real well here in the spring until about first part of june and then the heat sets in it gets
and june july august are most of those kind of plants are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers do you have a lot of shade trees around your house or is it
we're in a relatively new area we're kind of out of the natural tree area we're kind of up on a slope you don't have a lot of tree coverage? so we don't have where we are right now there are very few trees because going to make
this was pasture land but down the hill here a little ways there are parks that look like jungles they're really my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees
and they just shade everything
where is this? it's in georgia
in georgia it's right outside of macon and it's just a I like the way that idea of the south is but when I think of texas I think of nothing but no trees and just grass
I tell you what east texas there's two parts of texas east texas and north texas atlanta and dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything
the two cities are very identical so if you were familiar with atlanta it's that dry heat?
it's not dry at all it's humid where is it wasn't it houston's humid? houston is awful
houston is really humid it's humid
this is betty and I'm in richardson texas
I'm nola and I'm in plano here we go
I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that did some stuff over in the gulf did you push one?
I haven't pushed one yet I just
but I think it's I just started doing this so I don't know too much about it we're just sort of getting acquainted here
I just wanted to see if you had an opinion about this or
so if that's okay with you then I'll just press one that will be fine
if I start this I just wanted to say that one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are and they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours and right now I think that that's been proven in the fact that they have just anyway I just think that the united states policy over there I think we should just leave them alone I really do in a major way because that whole region over there needs to settle its own differences within itself
and that's the course that they should go we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on the thing with israel and palestine I believe that should be settled between them and also the other thing is our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them I'm talking about the whole middle and maybe this is too general but I just believe that they do not look at democracy the same way we do they don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live
and so trying to put a square peg in a round hole is just I don't think that that's the way to go in this and that's a couple thoughts on it
I guess I'd like you to maybe express something here
I think overall that's right I think it's kind of sad though that for generations they've been taught to hate each other
and if somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way that's
an I think that we do have completely different ways of looking at a lot of things but at the same time I think there is a lot of good that the united states and other countries can do as far as example and I think some different things could come from what's happened than what we expect I guess we could be a catalyst for their change I the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there and I don't think we'd be talking about this unless there had been a war that was one thing that came out of it good or bad
I don't judge any war as good or bad it's just a war
and I don't see any winners or losers I just see dead bodies I'm sorry but I just think you're right and I think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along it's not going to be that we're going to sort of tell them to go to their room and that's going to solve the whole problem
it's going to be them
but that's the type of thing they understand
they don't understand any other way and
and so at that you have to work at their level to an extent too it's that's true too I
they wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war they understand violence
there was nothing else they love violent leaders to look at the leader they had they just adored him because he was so strict and cruel
and for a while there he had them
I can't figure out why they adored him it has a lot to do with their religion I got to say that over there
and I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this because I've traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I've done that and one of the kindest people I've ever met in my whole life is from that area of the country and he is abounding in kindness let's say
and his wife is so godly every thought they have a totally different life than we have
and when you add the commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them
and they have very basic life it's just a very basic life and they just really believe in allah or god or whatever
and everything is to the glory of allah and it's almost like
what's sad is that the leaders that have control are power that's see using that
and they abuse that and it's always been military and it's always been and that's always been the way of the world don't you think
which I think that that's not the way the majority of the people over there really are so it's really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people
but I think in a way all the involvement over there too though has shown that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing and there are a lot of people who are good people
there's and I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and and surrendering that was
and the it just really comes down to people are people you have to have some compassion some humanness
that's right doesn't matter where the boundaries are there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages
and I think so much of it is what you're taught that's true
they teach their children in such a way that
I think the topic was crime in the city
I do not live in a city I live in a real small little place
where is that? it's about thirty miles from sherman north south east or west? it's north of sherman
you live almost in oklahoma not too far
that's kind of ironic because I don't live too far from oklahoma either
you know where saint joe is? I've been through there
I'm about eight miles south of it I had been through saint joe but just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
I've seen those statistics and everything and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry
the iraqis didn't have a lot of high tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that
and they didn't kill as many people in forty five days and they were intending to kill people
that was their job as they killed in washington d c I know I know I know I think nowadays people really just murder is nothing to them
I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years I guess and I've come to the conclusion even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prison's proven not to work just let them go say you're convicted
and just let them go
and if they get convicted again just kill them because most likely that will happen won't it that
I think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society
if someone is known to have been in prison they can't get a job you know
they can't be accepted into society if they're not going to be accepted into society then everybody's going to become sociopathic
and who's to put the limit on it? I was watching a thing last night up in washington state if you get convicted of sexual offenses on a regular basis some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions
and they're still let out on the street after one or two years in washington state if you're a habitual sexual offender they just don't let you out
so you serve your prison term and then you go into the mental hospital and if you're pronounced cured they'll let you go
they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now so you're kind of thinking in other words if you do something the first time that's not real bad
people make mistakes to go ahead and let them go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then
use that or there's other consequences rather than killing them you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against
at least they might get some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are okay they can free them
but with the technology we have today you can put a collar on a guy's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property it will just incapacitate them
and you can put a collar around a guy's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act
but putting them in prison that doesn't work apparently not because look how many years they've been doing that and look
you look at places like turkey turkey has the death penalty for just about everything
if you get convicted of drug trafficking they just kill you you get convicted of heinous crimes they just kill you there's no two ways about it
and you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times three or four times
the way to stop that kind of behavior is two fold that is true I know
one you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven I think that's very important I agree very much so on that I
and then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason take the kids away from the parents
because we are what we teach
because that's what our society becomes we have just a bunch of people comes
I've lived in that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work and these guys they come to work every morning and they're stoned to the bone they're so high they could fly up to the top of that building and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on monday and the kids of these people sure they just think that's the normal thing to do don't they they're sociopathic
and I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester
and these kids were more foulmouthed than I've ever been I had one kid threaten my life in the first grade
told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death
and they flipping me the finger and all that
and I just said to this kid I said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die
because you will eventually be killed and I'm just totally aghast at what's going on I know I know I work in school that's something I do and it really is I'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home
if they see violence at home that's what you're going to get from the kids at school
it really is and that's kind of sad
you can see it in the work place used to be when you had a personality conflict you worked with it and you got through it
now people get fired or what's even worse is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired
or one thing or the other you look at another kind of society like the japanese you put that many people on that small of a space they've learned to live together it's in their culture and one of the things that's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen teen
and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people if they weren't fit for the job they were hired for they didn't just can them they made a position for them some where
you look at frito lay my wife used to work for frito lay as a typist transcribing stuff into the computer
she could type about one hundred and five words per minute but she don't like it she just doesn't like to do that she will
but her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is
how has it been this week for you? weather wise or otherwise? weather wise
weather wise damp cold warm damp
we have gone through what might be called the four seasons in the last week
we have had highs of seventy two lows in the twenties I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then it was ninety six yesterday
I heard about that and we set a record yesterday and very windy but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool I think right now it's sixty nine
and that's cool for or it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant no rain in the last month I don't think the ground's very dry and our yard work everything is in bloom so our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry but I guess it also brings about allergies we're having a lot of allergies down here right now
everything blooming and the weather
and I think a lot of people have contracted spring fever too had a lot of people out at work for fishing and golfing reasons and things like that the blue flu
the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work
as I've said we have had variable weather
it has been untypically wet for this time of year
and also we have a lot of green the grass has been growing and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and buy a new spark plug or something along those lines
but fortunately it rains and you do not have to go out and buy the spark plug
but we've had an unusually warm spring and I guess we're still in winter and we have had no snow no snow? to speak of
we usually average anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation
so it's been inordinately warm here for this time of year
so in that regard it's fine but I envy you your ninety four degrees
I thought I heard this morning that in san antonio it was in the nineties yesterday it is down in the more southern and western areas and of course we are about two hours from the northern border straight south
and very windy it's amazing to me because I have only lived in dallas for three years and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time
it does I very seldom if any I can't remember a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing
I spent six years in graduate school in indiana in the flatlands and it was that way every day
rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour summer and winter
so that you became accustomed to it
but otherwise as I said we have had a relatively mild winter speaking for this area of the country
where did you go to school in indiana?
purdue purdue I have a brother that lives in south bend indiana
and I had to always I've lived there for eight years myself I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to notre dame but I didn't
you are not from that area originally I can tell originally I'm from new mexico
I was born in new mexico and we lived in south bend for eight years and then moved to tennessee actually and
I thought I heard a little tennessee in there somewhere very much very much cause I spent thirteen years there and then moved to dallas about three years ago so
you've moved around as much as I have my father was in the air force so I see
I worked for the government so I moved much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years
but I guess this is my first conversation in this series
I received a call last night because of the I had not received my personal identification number
so I had to call jack godfrey today to ask him what it was because I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line
is there any I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk it's just as long as you want to
it's just as long as you want to and just a reasonable lengthy conversation do you work for texas instruments?
I do not I work for g t e
and I was sent an application from jack
I've known jack for some time I'm in the speech processing business and have been for a number of years
so I was very much interested in being a speaker for this
actually I work for texas instruments and I'm an environmental engineer
I see and they just published this internally getting people involved
that's really strange I was wondering why we had somebody from maryland though I was saying do we have a ti in maryland or
I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area if just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative
but I have been a speaker in other similar type of activities
and I know the reason why this is being gathered and the program and so forth so as I said I was interested in being a speaker
we haven't talked much about the weather
I know that's what we're supposed to do really the letter just says let's see I can't I was looking at it I was trying to find out speedy short cuts and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and end it when needed so
in environmental engineering
is that with regard to work place engineering or just the work place environment or it's actually waste water
I see taking care of I'm actually in the air division and we monitor anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building or we do have customers that their concerns are in the work place and we take care of that but within our department we take care of everything waste water solid waste and recycling and air and
I had the call last evening was supposed to be concerning recycling in the community
the call I received and so I had thought a little bit about it before hand
so I but that's interesting I have a friend who is a planner a city planner
and one of his and he models city districts and so forth does computer modeling
and one of the he gets inputs from an environmental engineer actually our division is corporate wide and we take care of just the dallas area
of course we have several plants here but we do air modeling also
I see and I take care of all the air modeling specifically for the dallas area what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information temperature wind speed wind direction and we have a huge chemical data base
that's interesting and our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site and its concentration and if anything ever happened a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station
you keep up with current events?
somewhat somewhat not not as well as I would like to probably is that right?
but that's the way it goes whereabouts in pennsylvania what? where in pennsylvania?
state college I go to penn state do you
how's we're not supposed to talk about that we're supposed to talk about current events
I'm a current event junkie so I try to watch the news and I read the newspaper and I like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world I see
what particularly are you interested in? I just pretty little about everything and then again not everything
but I like to know pretty well what's happening political things don't interest me a great deal except I do like to stay informed enough to feel like I halfway vote intelligently
but other than that I just just the events that happen around the world interest me stay in touch with it and feel like I know what's going on
I have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events I see but I always have been
and I stay up with it but how do you stay aware of most of the current events newspaper? t v news or what? some of both
I read the newspapers sometimes
and I watch c n n that sort of thing occasionally that's good
and I read magazines and such you stay up with it pretty well then not that badly
so I am interested in what's going on and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about haiti recently because I've been down there you've been there
and you would be interested in it then
I follow it I don't just read everything about it but I'm always aware of what's going on like that
because it's interesting
and I don't know I feel sorry for those people down there they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many years through papa doc that's true
they've never really had a good leader he was a terrible tyrant
and I think it's been better since he died but it's still been bad
but even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew I've read some things about him that he wasn't too good himself
he was pretty much a he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things
but it's one of the reasons the u s didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them I see
but then again who those people are so used to it I guess it's the only thing that works
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in america? I think it's pretty darned good I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
I really do sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme the media does but that's kind of understandable because of course if you watch it more than once a day it's the same thing over and over and over and over and I listen to the radio
so you hear so much you get a little tired of it but then again so many people only catch it once a day maybe
but I think the quality of our news is just I don't believe it could be better I really don't
I think it always could be better but I would agree that it's pretty good I don't think so I don't think our news could be better
what else could they do to make it better
I don't see anything that they could do
I think that I don't know you always want to think everything can be improved upon the
I understand what you're saying
I think that but by trial and error over the years I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it
that may be so nothing is perfect
I think that I'm not always satisfied with how deep they dig into things and such
that's true I understand what you're saying and then again I understand why they can't dig too much deeper that's why we have c n n
c n n has the time to dig deeper
all set then what do you think about it?
I think it's a real good concept drug testing procedures would have to be refined
from what I've seen on the news there's a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in drug testing I didn't realize that
there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their test but they didn't know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down and turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody else's blood test
same sort of problem that happens sometimes is some of these aids tests and such
that's right I have heard I don't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some kind of word they use when you get a positive indication of drugs but there weren't really any there
every now and then there's an error and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated
I work here at texas instruments so do we everyone coming in I guess I did three years ago
everyone coming in goes through the drug testing procedure and they talk about it as better for the country and better for the working conditions
so if they test for drugs
I can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore I know we did in the military but I don't know if once you're in they continue to do it
but I guess you're always on call for it
I not very long ago worked for wal mart
and about a year and a half ago they instituted a drug and alcohol testing program it's not a random
through the it as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a blood test
but I think the big problem though is they send these off to large labs
and then they have thousands and thousands of samples going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up things like that so your big beef with it is the
it's it's a good idea but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better
make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever I tend to agree with you david
my brother used to work for wal mart and then I don't know if he still does or what because I don't know if sam's is actually part of it but he is working at sam's now
sam's is part of wal mart then he's been working for the company for a while too he good company
you all have some he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that company's that was a great place to work so it's good news
they had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock and you have a little taken out of your check each payday to put against wal mart stock
but you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while that's what my brother was telling me that's good deal how long were we I haven't done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for?
you're supposed to get five minutes we got a couple more minutes then I guess think what else I can say about that
do you have any idea let's see you were tested for drugs as you got into t I? everyone coming in goes through the drug test
were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or let me think about that it was after I had already been hired
you get hired then you come in the first I seems to me I remember that I was hired came in and went through some orientation and I thought I I can't remember that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test maybe it was during the interview I came up a couple times for an interview so it's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened but just like other companies other friends I've been hearing about that have been moving around it's before they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment so I'm sure that happened to me too
what about they just instituted it there at wal mart so
it was after I was already working there and they weren't testing any of those who were already working so what's your favorite t v show?
I used to like st elsewhere
that's one of my old favorites and that's I'm being beeped so I'll just ignore it and now I did like thirty something
my daughter says nine oh two one oh we like that one that's one of my favorites
and how old are you? I'm twenty eight
so you're little bit younger than I am but I think if my seventeen year old my fourteen year old my other two children like it I'm over forty and I like it I think it's wonderful it's a good show I like murphy brown and designing women too
we are so busy with all of our kids are in sports and I hardly ever watch t v but that's one that we watch and then sunday nights we watch life goes on I like that that's a good show too
very good did you see the one on sunday? it was a I did miss that sunday I didn't
that one kid that becca likes he has aids it's a good episode
the new character on there did
all the way to north carolina what time is it there? it is twenty minutes to nine
I'm twenty minutes to six here three hours difference
what else do you like? let's see I like a lot of different shows let's see I like murder she wrote that's
I never watched that ever in my entire life and matlock is another good one I watch
then during daytimes I like all my children
a small bowl will be plenty that's mine that's the only one I watch whenever I a small bowl will be better because it's pretty fattening talk to my daughter all my children I've watched that for about twelve years
I'm sure I watched it for more than that probably twenty something I used to watch general hospital when I was a teenager because I I quit watching general hospital when leslie got killed
so that was a long time ago I used to watch it in high school and college when laura's mother got killed
she was my favorite character on there
I just I read the reason they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract and I said if they're going to do that to her I won't watch it
that's great I do like all my children and I like it I don't know I just I like the people on it I guess I like it I just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back
tad's going to come back I bet do you think? I'm sure he will
he'll come back show up at just the right moment I kind of wish that nina would come back because the story
just for a brief visit or whatever because it never has been resolved with palmer remarrying and everything
daisy pops in once in a while and I forgot about nina and cliff cliff's on the young and the restless now
he is so he's out for good he's out for good did they marry? nina and cliff? that's how they left the show but not in real life
now she's married to some guy in new york and she's happily married and that's the reason she left the show I guess she wanted a private life
I watch it maybe twice a month so I don't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies I watch because I play lots of tennis and I'm gone a lot so I don't get to watch I watch it everyday religiously I videotape it when I have to miss it
I used to be like that I'm that way about a lot of different shows I'm that way about murphy brown designing women
don't they have a new chick on there instead of what's her name? there's two new characters on there there's jan hooks from saturday night life I don't know if you know her or not
that's a show I like and then the blond headed girl that used to be on newhart
I don't like her on it I never have liked her so
I just know which one she is I don't she's taken suzanne's part and then jan hooks has taken charlene's part charlene was delta burke? charlene was jean smart the blond headed
I never watch that one either I really don't watch a whole lot of t v just on sunday nights life goes on comes on about the time that we eat dinner and my whole family's home because I don't allow the kids out on sunday night because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day
and so we sit around and eat popcorn and then we watch america's funniest home videos those are always pretty cute murder she wrote comes on opposite of that and so
so you don't watch that one instead of I pick nights pretty much so on t v that I watch different networks
but beverly hills nine oh two one oh I watch it religiously
we like that real well it be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebody's getting killed on it I know the kids already know who it is I don't know who it is though who is it? ask them let me ask nicole nicole
how do you feel about it?
I don't have any strong convictions about it that's for sure I know I haven't done any peace corps service and I don't know anybody in my immediate family that has ever even thought about it do you know anybody that's been it? the only people I know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries and that's only because I went to baylor and a lot of students from baylor go and serve as missionaries during the summer but I think that's a terrible idea that's like forcing someone to donate to a charity
and it's nice to try to teach young people some civil consciousness but forcing them to donate basically their time and efforts
it's definitely up to the person so I'd have to say that the people who do it some feel it's rewarding I don't know but I don't know how we got the subject you have to I don't either
I have nothing to say about this I don't either I almost hung up because I thought I don't really have an opinion except for no I think that's dumb but
how long you been in san antonio? I've been here for just almost four years
and I lived with dana in school
that's how we know each other
and you were just up there then last weekend we went to six flags saturday had a good old time
that's good back to the topic at hand what other types of community service would they be talking about the recording mentioned the peace corps
this is major long term commitment a year or six months
so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe or I don't know but I'm all for donating my time to worthy causes I do some volunteer work here and there and every once in a while I'll do a local big brother big sister thing or I'll go do a
but that time is minuscule compared to what they were referring to
I couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to go do something
they couldn't cover my hourly rate
I couldn't afford it
but I have this thing against bugs too and seems to me like the peace corps they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs
africa have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything I'd probably catch a terrible disease and die
I doubt that but you know how it is
it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture usually I guess
I think that maybe that's why some people do it is to see the other cultures and some of that
but to do that I don't know I'd have to be I don't know I don't know either growing up all I knew was you go to high school you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work and none of this you go spend two years in the peace corps to broaden your horizons
I know american express I'm working at american express now and they after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off six months or something for some type of sabbatical or something like that
and they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off
so it is something that I think even the larger organizations will support it's really for the community to give back to the community type of thing
I don't know I think at the same it's for some people to help them grow in other areas kind of like joining the military
in that respect a lot of people join the military to grow up and to decide what they want to do
and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as that kind of a time
maybe a little bit in that perspective and a lot of people have gone in the military when they're in the college sometimes it's to help support college the money
others people don't know what they want to do but as far as the peace corps I suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives but I think a lot of it's when people get older they'll do something like that I'd probably have a different perspective if I actually knew someone that had gone into the peace corps but I don't
I don't and none of my
didn't mean to cut you off there that's okay and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything so I don't really know anyone first hand that's committed a chunk of their life to do service work
I everybody I know has been I'm going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car so
or try to make a living
but I don't know anybody that's done that either so I it's interesting we got this topic because I don't know what I marked off to get this but I certainly didn't mark off anything to get this one I can't imagine and the switchboard's been down for several days and the last time I called it before it went down I had this topic and I didn't feel like talking about it so I hung up and I guess they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
so you had the same one
you'll get it over with here I know
how many times have you talked? probably five or six not a whole lot
I've done maybe four or five did dana sign you up for this?
she just sent me the information out I got a hold of it I just sent it back in and that's she stuck my name on some list so they mailed me the information that I filled out
what other topics have you had? I've talked about camping with someone I've talked about the weather
that one was interesting because I talked to a man in washington d c and it was hot here and it was snowing there so that was pretty interesting
and I talked to someone about the education system I forget exactly what the focus was on that one but that was fairly interesting and I talked to somebody about credit card usage
and I talked to this person who I gathered from speaking to her that she and her family just didn't have much and they didn't have much credit available to them
and so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work and how you can use them to your advantage and how you can do certain things with them
I use everything with my visa and I pay it all off
so that's a good deal for me I get free money for thirty days
that's the way I use them
I try to make sure I don't get in debt so that's always a good plan I can't think of anything else that I've talked about most of the ones on the list I checked off stuff like football and stuff that I would enjoy talking about and I haven't gotten a one of them yet when I've called
I had let's see I've had fishing and me and dana had football we did how funny
so we talked about the cowboys a little bit and I'm out here in phoenix so we talked about cardinals
so that one was all right and then what else did I have? I think I had some other like staying in shape or working out I got this guy from new york so I had to talk to someone about hobbies and the switchboard called me so I was caught a little off guard and I couldn't think of anything at all so I started making stuff up I told this woman that my hobby was gardening and I can't even grow an ivy
and you've probably never gardened in your life my grandfather gave me a plant once and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill you could freeze it you could dry it out no matter what you couldn't kill it I killed it pretty quick
I don't have too much of a green thumb either so
I do have one plant here it's been hanging out for a while but I think it's one of the easiest plants I don't know the name of it but I'm not too much into
so we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a computer here at the house
and I made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month and then basically since then what I've done is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on the check coming in then how much I'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also because our house payment is once a month that's our biggest expense so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck even thought it's really still there so that I can keep good balance a running total through the month a running total what do you all do?
we've taken how much we have write down how much we have coming in each month and then we've at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend we made up different accounts we've set a budget for each household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our own fun money and just stuff like that and then each time we spend something we write down in a book and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we we try to stay within a certain budget so is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well?
it takes some dedication to do it but it works out real well so and you're staying within your budget and everything is working pretty good
I have to stay within it so I and then we have that if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have a budget for we call our slush fund or something and an unexpected comes up then you don't feel so strapped you don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that
because we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month that's a good choice we're trying to do that this year we've budgeted the money that we were spending on a coda account with t I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year we've taken that this year and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards
you've got paper under your table and we have another loan with the bank
and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we'll be free and clear to be out of that free
the only thing we have to pay off is a automobile loan and our house payment and that's the only thing we ever that's good to be in that kind of shape we try to stay out of debt what are you all trying to do long term
it's long term we just his retirement plan and then to coda and stuff like that that's all we and we just have our life insurance for right now
so we don't have any long term in stocks or anything like that right now so mostly what we've done the coda account with t I where we put in so much a month and then they or so much a pay check and then they match it
that's what we're doing so that's worked out pretty good and then I used to work for t I and I have when I retired from there or left I took the money that I had in mine and put it in an I r a and we had an existing I r a so both of us have some money in an I r a that we're also trying to figure we're putting it in c d's right now
and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a c d for a while and then if we need it we wait until it's expired so the other thing that we've done that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies john hancock company came out and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and what our goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house special thing buying land and building our own house
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time or not
that sounds interesting we've never done we have our life insurance guy has come out and he's determined how much we need if something were to happen that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done with our life insurance since I'm at home now is figuring out what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me that's a big thing to think about
if I would sell the if something would happen to him I wouldn't stay in texas I would sell the house and move back home to my home town and I wouldn't stay here in texas so I don't know what he would do I guess that's most of my financial plans right now
mine too is there anything you'd like to add?
that's about all for mine it's been nice talking to you
nice talking to you too we're set
what changes do you feel have happened?
I guess the first thing has been for the right for women to vote I think that has been a major change and also the fact that there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were and that's probably going to increase increases each year doesn't it? I'm sorry? it increases each year I think
it sure does there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays and I think women have kind of had in the past the real subservient role role? and
that's changing we do to some degree
but I think it's not as much as it was
I agree it definitely has changed and especially with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more from men
because there is just impossible to keep up on everything else
have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home
they've been talking about and I don't know what the status is on it but women get maternity leave and stuff like that and I know that there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out
but I haven't really heard much about that recently there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason
in fact I know the school districts down here they don't have maternity leave you simply have to accumulate your sick leave and take your sick leave is that right?
and I don't know if bigger company companies do but when I was employed with the school district I didn't have maternity leave either and that was the reason because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men so that's interesting
that's a bummer though it is
you got to take the time off you have to save all of your vacation time
you do you have to save all your vacation time and that's usually how it's happened but
what do you see changing in the future?
I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies run by females and top level and we'll I'm sorry? maybe top level
upper management more women in upper management and probably we'll see more females in political roles more governors and roles like that that would be kind of nice
in texas we have a female governor that's right that's right
and we had a female mayor here in dallas and her term just ended so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future I think that's probably good a little more integration
and maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners and
and that's fine with me I think
but sometimes I'm not a women's libber by any means but I do
there are issues that as far as equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff I totally am for
but I don't get into the real women libber movement I don't either I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal
we just function differently
and I'm not capable of lifting what a man can lift and that type of thing
but one of the big changes they're doing in salt lake is
and they're probably I'm sure in dallas since you're big places a lot more women are working right out of their home with their p c's or with their lap computers or whatever
I've heard of that I haven't really talked to anybody that's too involved with that but I think that is a I think that
like the cottage industry is that what you're talking about women working out of their homes?
I think it's wonderful you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week and
course they're talking about that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that I
by the phone and all that so it would be kind of exciting in some ways to see a little bit more of that and some ways it might be kind of scary
think anybody could do it but
I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up
but then there is the process of selection would you have to give them the brand
and when you shop you usually compare the prices
and would be nice though
what do you think about the self insurance business?
I watched something on t v a couple of months ago by ex surgeon general koop
and he talked about canada's system and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that but the expensive stuff heart operations and things they have a managed scarcity and they said that in canada there were as many heart trauma centers as there is in san francisco so in one city in america there's as many hospitals that are equipped to do heart operations as in the entire area of canada and that's kind of spooky I understand what you're saying and there's probably some truth to that I think that generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities however when anybody can't police their own profession it eventually leads to that and I think the costs and the way the medical profession has every year I being in my own business in the last six years every year there's been at least minimum twenty five percent increase in health insurance costs and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter
I think they're asking for it I think the medical profession is just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over and
do you think that it's just medical guys? what about how expensive new equipment and technology is that's where I think most of the cost is coming I think a lot of it is I don't disagree totally with that but my wife this last summer when we were on vacation tore up her knee and it was ligaments in her knee as it turned out
she came back that we were out at cape hatteras when this happened and she got home and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come he knows knee problems
if anyone does this guy knows it she goes in he says I think this is what it is but you better go to the hospital and have one of these m r I things a thousand dollars for this magnetic resonance imaging type thing and my wife said do I need that? and he says it'll help me diagnose this I suggest you go have this thing insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital a thousand dollars for thirty five minutes
doctors routinely send people in for anything for years they didn't have this and they solved these problems and
I said to her look if you feel you got to go go but I think a thousand dollars these guys I don't know what it is but there's no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day
and even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at roughly a thousand dollars every half hour that's ridiculous I don't care what anyone says the costs are not it's a picture it shouldn't cost more than thirty five bucks for something like that reasonableness but they aren't reasonable fifty a hundred dollars they don't have to pay them back in three months time
I'll have to agree with you there
but there's another problem and that's how litigious our society is if the doctor makes a mistake he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court I think that's another problem but that's part of our legalese problem and that the government eventually will address too just because it's out of control I agree with you I was on a jury I didn't make the jury but there was a deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant
it was three days after it was born and he was the one that delivered it and they got four attorneys one guy out of houston he introduced himself as snake so and so and he says anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars and I says yeah I got problems with five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back as sorrowful as it is if the doctor is wrong he should be pulled from his license but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it it doesn't make logical sense to me but it doesn't that's
the term personal computer I don't happen to have one at home but I do have a personal computer on my desk here
a type of work station? it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to bypass the formal procurement process and it works just fine it says it's a monochrome monitor panasonic printer no big deal it does the things I need for it to do
is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine? it's not even that
it's eighty eighty eight? I think that's about where it is
what type of utilizations do you make of it? word processing obviously I do that I do some lotus on it do some samna some p f m nothing extremely complex
I use them both here at work and at home
and I have I b m clones in both cases
here at work I have the t I one thousand which is a three eighty six base machine I bet that's a pretty nice setup
it is unfortunately I need all of it
for example I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size
and I know that brings an eighty eighty eight machine to its knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine
and it brought it to its knees just in the ability to handle
and then I have a three eighty six f x a sixteen bit machine at home
and I'm really pleased with it
it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and database searches
what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them have you
to try to make them more effective and useful
have you been struggling along those lines? I seem to always be in the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in samna I was still in p f m and now that I finally become proficient in samna everybody's going to wordperfect so I can never quite stay current with that
I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it it's I used it on some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it
the at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of a sudden you got a disc full error not a fun thing to try to recover from I can believe that very frustrating
but again I've been dealing with large files both data and otherwise that was a engineering spec on b two you come here with the b level of specs? not really I'm not that up be on that sort of thing
it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build to one level down from assistant description
it sounds like you're pretty much into computers
I sure need them there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to try to do my job without them I can believe that it's been interesting
maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things I think that's when you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have when you start seeing what all they can do for you of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing
I understand that if needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty six machine at home I is that the newest thing now the four eighty six?
that must be a fairly recent release
that came out around the first of the year because I had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes but I didn't know they had a four eighty six just yet
it does a few more things than had been available before
but I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the translation because you no longer can think that fast anyway
I enjoyed our discussion I did too and you have a good day you do the same
so how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years?
I'm at a little bit of a loss I don't know ten years ago I'm about twenty eight now so when I was eighteen
things haven't changed a whole lot
people are being a little less bigoted in some ways I don't know seems to me
I guess I'm like my parents the younger generation gets away with hell but
it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because I've changed I used to live up north down here dallas seems to me the police are militant
but where'd you live up where'd you live at
I lived in akron ohio did you? I'm from illinois so
how long you been in dallas? about eight years
in fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live
as you're talking police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do
I think it's crime has got a lot worse in the last ten fifteen years I agree
and maybe that has a lot to do with it I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse and I think there's to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values that's true that's true but
I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved
but that's more a matter of I'm no longer a teenager in high school
I think there's more pressure on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and
somebody's at the door
hang on just a second
but I don't know that's one thing I see a lot more double income families and a lot more baby sitters raising the kids and things like that I guess
that's true it's getting more and more expensive to live that's for sure
you can't make it without it hardly that's right
I guess when I was growing up it was still the ideal to get a home and buy house and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever
you just don't buy a house just because they can't get into one that's right the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways
so that's a good point so I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years
for me it's kind of hard I don't know I think I don't know I think the middle class is shrinking and the lower class is expanding I agree
and sooner or later there's going to be a turn around I hope so at some point but I don't know at what point
but I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class
so usually is I think it's
it's hard for me to say I hope it happens because I'd be one of those that gets caught but on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be changed that's right do you work at t I? do you?
what department do you work in? I'm in semiconductor are you? I'm in semiconductor division too
how long you been with them since you moved down here?
about eight years I'm over at the center one building
so am I are you really what floor? two I'm on the seventh floor
how about that it's a small world so let's see second floor you work with linear
do you know alec morton?
I've probably seen him around you do he comes up and pushes us around so I'm pretty familiar with
are you d a d or something up there?
are you d a d or something? you must know him his reputation precedes him seventh floor
t a d he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief they say it's what makes him happy is to give us d a d ers grief so I can believe it but
let's see if you've been in dallas eight years I guess that's about how long I've been in here about eight years too I guess been with t I twelve but I started out in lubbock lubbock is I don't know I guess if this is the only place you've lived lubbock is a lot different than dallas flat dry and dirty
but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too here in dallas everything is just real rush rush
I lived in the country for several years and living in the city is a whole different social structure
but I got some friends that seems like he went to school at devry is there a devry in akron? I don't even know
I haven't been up there in years I see he went to school somewhere in ohio and he's from that area and he works over in the park central building I think but I haven't talked to him in a while but he misses it he used to go back twice or three times a year because he missed it sounds like you haven't been back there in a while
I haven't been back in ten fifteen years you still have relatives back there or
I do I just haven't had a chance to get back
catch them next year probably let's see how long are we supposed to talk here?
I don't know I think we ran out of social changes to talk about
so my kids are probably needing me to go so
it's nice talking to you talk to you later do you have children?
I have a daughter do you how old is she?
she's only about a little less than two years old I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to promote a college or anything
I've got one that's seven and one that's three so we started saving but that's all
are you planning to encourage your children to go to a particular school?
no particular school I think that's really a decision that that you are going to let them make
they help them make in terms of what they are wanting to do
that's a big influence I think and not only what you can afford but what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are
so you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do where did you go to school?
university of mississippi was that local or
it was within the state
but it was not necessarily local it was so what's
what's the criterion for choosing to go there?
at the time I was thinking of going pre med
and in the state they had the best pre med curriculum for the state institutions
it was choice between there and a private college that was a bit more expensive
at the time we really could not afford it so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me
it I enjoyed it did you commute everyday then or
it was a six hour drive when you said it was quite a way away I did not know that meant you had to drive an hour or
it was like another world
basically it was a did not get home that often and at that age it's kind of difficult sometimes
especially if you have not been away a lot that extended
did you go there straight out of high school?
I did not get my degree until later on so I just finished mine a couple of years ago
and I guess when you have to do it that way it makes your choices a lot easier but
that's true that's like when I went on to get my master's it was where I was at the time
I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled
and I was trying to work so when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go
which group do you work in in t I?
the computer science center where is that at?
north building I see how long do you work for t I?
about three years did you work somewhere else sounds like you got your master's before here or
I have actually I came straight from school to here I see
cause this was the first real job after getting my degree after your master's or after your after my master's I see
my undergraduate degree was not in what my master's was I see
so I made a career change basically
I see let's see I have not there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools just like you said depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that so I have not really made up my mind whether to encourage them to go different places or
one day I would like to the I like the school where I went
and I would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to
or the school where I got my master's at which was a different school
and I liked it almost as well
but you know that I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there I think that's
if they want to that's fine but otherwise not although I would get quite a break on tuition
because you went there
because they allow for tuition break for out of state students who children of alumnae I didn't know that
certain schools do it
this school does so it
I was involved in some alumnae recruiting here in town last year
and it was kind of fun because you are trying to get people interested in your school
and they were this was a college night at a high school in richardson and it was
and there were a bunch of kids and a bunch of schools there were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids
it's kind of interesting to talk up your school your own school
and I was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of our school and were interested in it
we situations like that you don't realize until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others
and so I was real real pleased with that that worked out so well did you drum up any interest then or that's good I think so
I don't know offhand but it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there
so there was one mother who came by right even before we started who obviously was very interested in getting her daughter in or having gotten her daughter in or something and that
and she was wanting some more information but her daughter was a baton twirler or something
and she was letting us know how good her daughter was
she had business cards describing her daughter's she had won several different twirling awards and all this
and she had these business cards she was passing out and it was quite a production I think some parents go a little bit overboard it sounds like it
I think richardson is probably one of the places that would definitely
what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful
have a big family I guess that's a start I guess so how old are you?
twenty five so so you have been to some family reunions perhaps I just got married
every four years on one side of my family they plan on having my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids how long in advance do they let them know?
we plan on it it's the third weekend in august so it's every four years and so so they all know it
and then arrangements are made during the summer for food and who's staying where because a lot of people are from down here in texas
and a lot of my family is in indiana that's where I'm originally from
so we usually meet at my uncle's cottage at the lake and make a couple days of it that sounds like fun do they all have the small children too that come?
pretty much so all ages
and there's some my age and then there are some a lot younger about four generations I guess my husband on one side has an extended family
and they don't ever plan it like you do
I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because they're rather socially active too
and so it seems by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there if they don't they'll say we're planning to go to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them
my parents are the youngest of very large families
therefore they don't have many people left
and the few previous ones I've had I haven't known many of those people but in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family and that's been very nice with I have one sister and three brothers
and they're only three out of five of us who have children
so we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other
and that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large
and they don't see each other very often we don't really know many of them
that's kind of bad it really is they're fun they're a lot of fun
but still they're not done on a regular basis and you kind of forget what happened and who they were from the time before
it's fun getting together with immediate family a lot of my cousins are real close and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that so those are the ones that are in texas?
or you go to indiana on that?
the ones in indiana where in indiana? lafayette lafayette I don't know where I used to live in indianapolis
it's a little north of indianapolis about an hour it's very pretty country in there I think it's gorgeous
so I when is your next one scheduled now
it's like the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when I graduated from college so I guess about two more years and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you
maybe I don't know maybe
two more years I don't know probably you need another milestone
I guess that's what I've been married now for about nine months so that was another milestone I guess I'm sure and then all of your family probably has not met your husband
he's from indiana is he?
so they all met and you're both living in sherman do you work to t I? and does he?
he's trying to get in med school so we don't either but I have a friend who is working on this project and
are they getting all the data they need? I don't know I have a hard time getting people on the telephone
getting through to anybody sometimes I call off and on all day
but anyway I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we but I got off that
we've kind of exhausted everything I guess I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes
and we both look forward to going to our next reunions I'm sure
but it has been fun talking to you you too thank you
and maybe I'll talk to you again
how long have they been recycling there in virginia?
actually quite a while I've lived here for six years and can you hold on just a second?
I'm sorry I must have got the other line cut off so they've been doing it for a while now
and it I live in an apartment
and my facilities there it is hold on
sorry about that you're okay
they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and at another public facility where they have recycling of glass aluminum and paper
have you recycled plastic also?
and that's what I don't understand exactly why they don't have that option we have out here up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way
they had some bends around that we could find and put them in
but not all that many it wasn't very well advertised
but recently the refuse department is working on getting a system going where we will actually have a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things
so it should be good
I think it's a marvelous idea when I just think of the papers that I dump out
there just it's such a I waste I just hate to think about it
an additional thing is where I work they also have recycling there of all white paper and of cans also
so a lot of people right at the vending machines they have receptacles that you can just pop your cans in
and near the xerox machines they have places for your paper
I keep a little box at my desk
and as I'm using the white paper I just throw it right in there
and then they have someone that comes around and pick it up every afternoon which is an excellent idea at work because I know the amount paper they go through there that's neat
because that's right I guess one of the things that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about it
there's needs to be more public service programs or something that would let us know had happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening
I would agree with that and there's
I've seen a few things but not very much really
and I think that's a shame they need to do a little more I'd like to know for instance when they say plastic all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to
maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use I don't know
but I'd be glad to organize it if they'd tell me what it is I'm doing because that would be really helpful
I agree with you there another thing that I like here which is I do with I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that their aluminum cans is for children's hospital for a burn fund
so all the monies are donated for the recycling to children's hospital which I think is an excellent idea there because the other public that's great
that gives you a little bit of incentive there
and before even at work before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since january first of this year I had had everyone in my department recycling and I would have them drop their cans off in my office saving them for you
and then I would haul them here to this place for the children's hospital fund which got people really going into it I think that's right
but I think helping us be more enthusiastic about it helping us maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt that there you go making sure
that's for sure but I think that's I think there needs to be a little bit more in the area of advertisement and letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how it's done and what happens to it because I think that would help a lot
and I'm sure in the near future I would think they would be coming out with more
I've seen a definite trend towards more recycling everywhere even at mcdonald's with their use of no foam containers anymore I
I'm glad to see some of these things I think
I think it is getting more advertisement people are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped
and all these things that
I think that's true I think that's about my some on recycling
but I enjoyed talking to you I did too
what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation? I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force
few are basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively
I grew up in sixties and early seventies and my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up she didn't start working until I was well into high school
so I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids mine taught kindergarten but she was always I guess her schedule was shorter so she was always home
always home by the time you got home that statistic has been growing every year it's something around sixty sixty five percent or so now
I'm not sure what the future holds for that whether
it seems that there's a grass roots effort or whatever going on I clean houses part time
and almost all the people that I clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work that's unusual
they're all I think it's kind of a new movement it's going back towards women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where women stayed home with the kids and try to give the kids quality time
and I think you're going to see a lot more women choosing to not work after they have a baby
I think with the salaries that a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are vice presidents of companies and I think with this it seems like it's more the upper class people
I don't see it as much in my situation where I don't have children yet but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids but realistically I'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible for middle class people to be able to live just on one income that is tough we're looking at that now my wife's about six months along
I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
it's going to kind of go along with the b m w in the driveway or in the garage or whatever
and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home I would think it would be women that were working full time
believe it or not though all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home
they're real active in volunteer work
one of the women is real active with muscular dystrophy and does a lot of work with them on a volunteer basis but it's almost like a job she just doesn't get paid for it I guess that's good that they've got something to keep them active
when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home or is she going to go back to work? we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible what do you think?
that I would like to be able to do that we think it's that important and I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction I'm a counselor and a therapist
and I work with adolescents and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
I see a difference in even the generation before me were mom was like june cleaver or whatever
where the attitudes were a lot different as far as I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and a lot of the things that are going on in today's society
I think morally it seems like people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards the husbands roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too
so kids are raised around their friends and by the media
that's true and that's contributed
and I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so if there was some way for women to stay home even if they could work there are a lot of jobs that are coming about in computers at home and those types of things that would at least in some ways bridge the gap
I think that in the future the family unit as it once was known is going to be nonexistent what do you think? about?
that as far as do you think there's going to be still a family unit do you think that the trend is going more towards single parenting? the balance I don't the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while that's hard to say families are such a strange configuration anymore I see a lot of families where in the back I grew up about the same time you did
and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible
nowadays it's not the case kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and one of the reasons is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when
the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad so
you create a bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
so it's not a real functional situation anyway so I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the families as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society
I think that eventually the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are two parent families
that's pretty sad it is I guess unless there's a major swing in the change of what's important to people probably keep going downhill and I don't know we feel that we can make it on one income it may be tough but we may have to give up on some things
I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that
and it will make the strain worthwhile I think so too
I need to go ahead and wrap it up
it was really nice talking to you I've enjoyed it stephanie and thanks a lot
what do you think in terms of benefits?
personally I think of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package and I think that we've probably got one of the best around besides they tend to offer adequate vacation I guess and the paid time off is wonderful and one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that is offered and I think that is just a fabulous one so I don't know if you participate in that or not but
isn't it great? it's just a miracle how fast that adds up I have to agree with that I was thinking about importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while I was waiting for the system to find a respondent
and I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone
when I was much younger it was less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits but as I grow older and my family grows the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important
I had never really thought of it that way but I guess that's true I guess that's true I'm still young enough that the vacation's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing but as a matter of fact I just celebrated my fifth year at t I the end of last month and kind of started looking through the book because of that now that I'm a hundred percent vested you kind of look through the book and see what does that mean and what is the pension all about and when you're in your I'm only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but it's I guess now is the time to think about it so does t I have a pretty good retirement package? I think they have one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves
and that's certainly one of the reasons that they've begun the coda plan
it's certainly a supplemental way
and I suppose maybe in your instance if you're started with t I in your early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty five then you'll have a very good retirement plan
but I had another career first and then came to t I a little later
so it's not all by itself it won't be adequate for my situation it's not going to build up quite enough
so I have to find a way to supplement that
they seem to make it so easy to save one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check and it's probably not a great investment but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway I kind of have to trade off if you never see it you don't spend it and it's I understand though it
believe me I do that myself
do you? and I disagree with you I don't think it's the worst investment in the world do you really not?
I debate about whether it's really good or not it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later
it's shown a history that sure beats anything else over many many years
that's true that's very true
we went and did a thing through I b s which is a financial consultant type thing here in dallas and one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was they work up this whole big profile for you all the things that you need to work on and you need to do and then one of the things that we talked about with her was the need to save for our son's education we have a two year old and we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen we have to do that now and they have a way that they can figure what and he's two now in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to what it costs now is ridiculous what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a six percent interest rate to be able to have money for his college and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is about fifteen hundred dollars a year so I guess it in that way at least we know that that's taken care of we can worry about other things so I understand that approach
that's exactly what's happening in my family
is it really? except that mine are a little bit older and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there
you better make sure that you've got a scholarship that's right
that's right that's what she said to us she said do you all want him to go to a state college or a private college? and our answer was that we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just can't do it so I don't know it's I don't it just amazing it amazes me how much the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years I just don't know how anybody's going to do it I know and it gets really scary when you start talking to them I have an eleven year old daughter now who's saying dad I want to be an allergist
and I said that's wonderful I applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
and then her little brother's only two years behind
and he says I don't know I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian and I said that's great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that that's right
that's right t I offers some good stuff and then I think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere no matter where you go I have all this is the first really large company I've worked for I've always been involved in little small privately owned firms and so I've never had the big benefit package so I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what they offered so I've been real pleased that's fantastic
and on whole I would say that they're equal to most of our competitors
think so? I can see some potential changes that probably would not cost very much but might make things a little easier such as offering a smorgasbord having a larger variety of benefits
but here's the amount that t I is going to pay for it
and you can pick what you want and now it's up to you it's menu selection so to speak
that sounds really good I read a thing I don't even remember if it was in the dallasite or the insite one about companies allowing you and they said that t I was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which I thought sounded like a good idea if you've been there under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying I'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck and they're deducting it all along so you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you're really not being paid for them the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once so that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and t I said that they were looking into something like that so I could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime
and I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that
and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one as a repayment for every three to five days that I work overtime there they should give me one day
but it should be a standard and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate that's running in each department
and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and I see a lot of differences from one group to the next about who gets it and who doesn't get it and that's that way with a lot of things there it seems like it depends on what group you happen to be in what you're going to get and what you're not going to get so that's for sure
which is the same but then it's probably that way anywhere that's I'm sure personalities always come into play
just in this size of organization
ironically enough I'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last
I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle so
exercise is not supposed to do that to you that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way down the hallway do you do anything on a regular basis?
off and on off and on right now I've been off but I've been going over to the fitness center that's a good my husband's a t I er in the unit here three times
I try to go over there at least three times a week and I try to walk at least five times a week do you when you go to the I have to ask you and if this is getting to we're not supposed to get too particular but I'm just curious when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the dallas location or the spring creek in terms of it's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera
I've been going to spring creek I haven't been to the dallas one now in a couple of years
at least since they've supposedly redone so I don't really it's not that great and I go to the spring creek one on and off but my husband's working over there and he just goes to the dallas one but I just don't it's just so much weight lifting even the spring creek one has a lot of weights in it
that's true or is that what you're into or
I've used the nautilus equipment and the bikes and stair climbers and stuff like that mostly I don't use the free weights but I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there
I like those too and the pool when it gets warmer
and the pool that's great
I know what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in richardson near where we live in north dallas and long story short I hadn't this is really a stupid thing that happened but they have the gymnasium flooring and then they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand in any class like that I go to
instead of having that level they had a chrome strip that wasn't level
and it was about four inches deep and then about a seventy degree angle
and as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it
the orthopedist called it a basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped
I know we went to whatever in plano and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show
and the doctor said you didn't do anything there's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you that was tuesday night and wednesday night the radiologist called me at work and I was on crutches and he said I think you better call an orthopedist so we went to one and he just put a big old cast on it
put a big cast on it for about four weeks
four weeks I like aerobics but I'm not so sure that
not that much though I've never I was off for about six months too just for some other surgery I'd had but I was pretty much in shape walking and this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many people come in here with things like that because they are active
I was real embarrassed but I felt kind of stupid
those things happen though they do I guess I'm glad that nobody really noticed I guess you could say
because I got up and started jumping on it again
that did a lot of good I'm sure really I enjoy aerobics and I do it because I like it I like the music and that kind of stuff
I like the music but I've been unable to do that because I hurt my foot about five years ago I broke my heel
and that makes my foot how'd you do that? in aerobics?
actually I was up on a ladder and fell off leaned the wrong way and when I came down I hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete what'd they do for that? did they have to cast it?
they had to go in and do surgery they put a pin in it so the impact would not be good
as I permanently damaged the cushion under my heel the normal cushion that you have there
I can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt that makes sense so are you in terms of other things not running but playing a little bit of tennis can you not do stuff like that at all?
I haven't tried that I don't know I bet it's been thirty years since I played tennis it's been mostly into just walking and stuff like that that's probably the safer way because I notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things
I'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coronary
and there was my ego when I went ahead and I went I can do that and half the time though I don't jump half as much as
I'm real tall and I'm not heavy but when you go easy you need just take it easy
but when I see some and I just don't think it's healthy all that pounding all the time
it's not really good for your knees that's the other reason and I don't know this was just something freak that happened to me because I wasn't familiar with the
the floor was uneven it was completely it literally the two dissimilar floor coverings were not level and at first after it happened I thought maybe that's a handicap access and then I said no that's just the way it's constructed
and my husband being a t I engineer I said a few things to him when I got home I said who has engineered that?
but I sounds you one thing that I like like swimming you like that a lot?
I like swimming do you like that what that voice said do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to?
I liked it because I want to it makes me feel better that's how I am
if I don't do it I just feel like I don't have as much energy
and it's real funny because if you it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired but it's the other way around it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff but
and I need all the help I can get that gravity factor I know
it does get you like that orthopedist said to me he said don't worry diane he said you're at thirty something but you're on the upper side he said that don't worry he says even if you weren't doing anything that would start to happen to you
a lot because I said I'm not that heavy I'm not heavy maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being
I said why do I feel like I need to start pushing myself more and he goes human nature
and then you see these little girls in these little bitty things and they're all twenty one years of age
but luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele that's true they do except for the guys that lift the weights they do intimidate
I try to go real late or real early before they get there there some things I'd like to try but sometime when I ask I just feel like am I stupid or what
that's one thing I like about the spring creek place at least one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful
and his name is b j I think I've there was some girl there I've been there maybe a dozen times
but I actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
it's terrible I don't know if the dallas location it just seems that sometimes I feel like I'm in a singles bar
that's true and I haven't noticed that up at spring creek I haven't either and I just it's not that far of a drive and I'm glad they did that you're not missing anything at the dallas renovated site it's not at all anything worth talking about
I thought maybe one of these days I'll drive over there and check it out but if you don't live near there that's not worth
I live in richardson but it's about half way between the spring creek and the dallas site that's actually where this happened to me out in plano but it's all the same to me richardson over on campbell and park hill there's a new recreation center
and as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities walked out I was one thing I have purple tights on
and they're going but in general I like dance a lot so aerobics is something I'd hate to give up but he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling or
you probably will for a while because it's going to be real tender he told me eight to twelve weeks
not anything I said but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks he said yeah but that's just they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm but I just the more they tried to get my foot in the more I screamed I couldn't adjust that I know what you mean you know more about this stuff than I do obviously then
not fun you're walking okay now obviously and you can
I have a slight limp from it but it matches one if I have one on the other side
anything else about exercise we can talk about
other than I need to go me too me too I need to go actually get something to eat here
it's great though I really do enjoy it thank you sandy
what are your hobbies?
actually my hobbies now are t shirt making I'm making t shirts and sweat shirts in fact that's what I was doing when you called that sounds interesting what kinds of sweat shirts and t shirts do you make?
right now I'm making christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing is that silk screening or
I have material that I cut out and then you there's this stuff called wonder under that you iron it on and then you iron that on the t shirt and you paint around it I see
so it's real fun I started doing it as just something fun to do and now I'm selling them and pretty how's it going?
pretty good I just started last week and I sold seven I wasn't expecting that so that sounds great
I guess in my spare time I'll be making t shirts so somebody has to do it
that's right give you a little christmas money any way
that's correct what are your hobbies? I kind of have hobby fads I guess
when I was growing up I was into coin collecting and that dropped off about the time I hit puberty and then my hobbies in high school went just to the sports now my latest one is classic cars I had a sixty six mustang I was rebuilding
almost had it done and I went ahead and sold it
but it was fun I really enjoyed it
how'd you learn to do that to fix them up? you just
you just get a book that tells you how to do it or what? you just kind of all I did is I bought the car and then you can I was just in a supermarket and I seen a magazine for basically it was called mustang magazine and so I bought it
and they had some names some companies that sold mustang parts and I just started ordering some parts and basically what I did was I redid the whole interior I didn't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the whole interior and then part of the exterior just kind of do it
where'd you get the car? we lived in south dakota and I bought it up there before I moved down here
so it was kind of rusted out there there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here
that's true that's true that sounds neat I guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies
let's see that about covers mine and t shirt making about covers yours
let's see I've done other hobbies I'm a hobby person I've always done a lot of craft stuff I always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that and I collect dolls I have a huge collection of dolls which is still in new mexico with my parents in new mexico? from new mexico
let's see what else? I started collecting music boxes I guess that's a hobby that is
that's interesting how many music boxes do you have?
probably about twenty do they all play different songs
or do some of them play the same song?
they all play different songs that's neat what's the most expensive one you bought?
the most expensive I don't know I've gotten all of them for gifts I don't
bought a few of them I usually get them for christmas gifts and when people go on trips or something that's interesting it used to be tea spoons was the thing
that's true I never collected those that's interesting music boxes I have dolls from all over too that I started when I was a little girl and I have a lot of dolls
people would always bring them when they go to the countries and I did that when I went to europe one summer I bought a doll everywhere we went so how was europe?
economy it was great it was quick I was in high school and I was in a tour and we went all it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries and it was called people to people and we'd stay in people's homes and then we got to also tour big cities and I really enjoyed it was that in high school
or was that a college thing?
in was in high school so I'd like to go back because we had everything was rushed I bet
everything was an hour or two hours at the louvre things like that where you need the whole day but it really that's where a camcorder would come in handy
that's true that sounds real neat so you haven't been back to europe since then?
I always thought I would but who knows now I got married and maybe some day maybe it's one of those retirement things there you go does you husband what does he think of your t shirts and
he likes it all right he's been pretty good because there's t shirt stuff all over the house does he help out much or
when you baby sit what age group children do you sit with? all kinds mostly between the ages of two and ten
a few summers ago I kept two children every day for the entire summer and they became like my children
I'd think so and they live in an apartment complex so we swam a lot and we played on the playground a lot and then we would go to a movie on thursdays and there was always an activity they had their favorite t v shows and things like that that we watched and then we took naps and I don't know it just seems like there was always something to do children are so full of energy
and they just keep you going
was this a one parent or two parent family? one parent
one parent she's just
how much time did she spend with them? not much at all I would get there at eight o'clock in the morning the children usually weren't awake by then and she would get home at five thirty in the afternoon
and they would have dinner and then it was time for them to go to bed
now at this particular time the children were two and six but then I also I've been baby sitting this child for about eight years he's nine now and I've watched him grow up and he's like a little brother to me
and it's changed over the years we get along a lot better now that he's older
and we do different things now we used to play ball a lot but now he likes to watch t v and he's into wrestling and I kept him on friday night we went to go see a movie and things like that but I feel like when I have children I want to be able to spend a lot of time with them
you say you go to school? I go to l s u
and what are you studying? communications
sounds like you're getting a lot of experience in communicating with children I love children
I don't know seem when I was growing up my mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high and I don't I think it was very beneficial to us
in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books and we went skating a lot and she was just always there for us but nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does and the children either stay at home and get into trouble or they're stuck in a day care and I just don't want my children to have to be raised like that all my friends their parents worked all the time they got to stay at home by themselves and when I was younger I thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things like I couldn't ride my bike across the street but they could because their mom would never know it
but now I realize that it was better because they have got into a lot of trouble because of lack of supervision
that certainly can happen now if you say you're in communications
what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to? I'm majoring in public relations
public relations so you would have a job with a company? rather than radio or television or newspapers or what have you ma'am
and then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home or stay with the children? I would like to stay at home with my children for at least the first five years
but what I plan to do in the future is go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters and work on my doctorate and teach college
and in that case then I'll be at home when my children are at home but I'd like to stay at home with them until they get at least into kindergarten where they're at school from eight to three or something
and then I would be at my school teaching and
that's is an advantage of being in the education field I spent thirty four years in education and so what grade?
I started out with college and then went to high school and then I preferred the high school age level much better than I did the college because you have a closer relationship with the students that did you? what did you teach?
I taught physical education I started out as a p e major in education
I wanted to be a p e teacher I sure did
I found that it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
and it worked out fine from that standpoint plus the fact that when I left usually my husband was seldom home for maybe forty five minutes or so and then our son he had to get on the bus
and he did get on the bus it was his responsibility and he never ever thought of not going to school in view of the fact that he was certain I had a hot line to his school because I absolutely
I was in physical education then and I just kept getting pushed into administration wound up in administration and so he thought surely that I would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case
and I wouldn't have checked on him however there are points both directions in that from the standpoint of parents working and not working
I listened to more than one parent say I don't know what this child wants I'm working two jobs they each have their own television they each have their own telephone they each have their own rooms they each have this they each have that I'd say but what they don't have is you that's right they need some attention
absolutely and I think out because that is the way of getting attention whenever my mom stayed home with us we did without a lot we were it's hard to make it on one income
that's right but we did and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years
and we only had one car we only had one telephone
we didn't get to eat out all the time but I feel like that it helped me now because I appreciate the value of the dollar
and I also had the supervision that I needed while I was growing up and I hope that I can provide that for my child too
and we need more of that we need more parents willing to supervise though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure from the standpoint of church and school and everything along the way we have
and that has contributed much to the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having that the students parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning and I think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive experiences from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and keep going and not wait until they're in the ninth and tenth grades it's too late then you can not reverse that trend at that point it is it's way too late I agree
and while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point and that is just as valuable at that time as to the rush in the elementary it is because all the peer pressure it starts in high school
and the parent really needs to be there for the child
and the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football and I did keep statistics for his team and his dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team
and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time
so I feel that I learned a great deal from my students with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents and a thing such as one of the biggest complaints I well remember because I spent a lot of time with seniors was carrying their
when I was your age I didn't have this or that
and I know I never ever said that because I knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people I guess that was good that you were hearing it from other students
and I had to deal with their problems and I could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of lines so that I think he benefited from my experiences does your son work for t I?
he works for a different company in the dallas area but when he went away to and he was on the lawns from the time he was in the seventh grade and a small and all the way through college and he held three jobs wally was in college and we didn't even know it
he didn't even tell us that he had three jobs
but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account and we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go if he got married he was on his own if he flunked out he was on his own
I assume you have kids
we have one she's only nine months old she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet
my degree is in teaching so we have a little bit of a basis for conversation I was a substitute teacher for about a year
I thought I wanted to be a teacher but before I went through all of that I wanted to see how I was going to like it
and they in alabama where I came from they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree so I went out and played substitute for a while and decided not for me
did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or it was I just took grades one through six
I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong
my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but I taught junior high
and I expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn't that bad I taught remedial reading kids
and they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else
but at the time that's what I taught and you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way when you have your slow readers
but it wasn't too bad we got long real well I sometimes wonder if I didn't mess up I maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least if you have to you can get mean with them those little kids don't understand it
I especially with the real young ones I started out wanting to teach lower primary and then top primary and thought I don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth and so that's what I got my certification in
but I had decided long before I was even married that I wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
and my reason for that was I don't like the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools that's a nice way of putting it
you can find a lot of good public schools if you look real hard but I don't think they could cover everything that you could teach your children on an individual basis and too most people don't have that option
and plus it also depends on the district you're in as on the I've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public
I don't know back when I was going to school you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now
you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and usually bending over to get five of the best
but nowadays they can barely scold the children for something without getting sued
and the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the lower schools
the thing that really did it for me I was subbing in a fifth grade class and this kid comes to school with his lunch box and inside this lunch box he's got easily two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills
and I asked him what are you doing with that? and he says my father gave it to me and I didn't believe it for a minute
but the not a lot I could do about it
can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants
crazy for him to but I have I've I think I understood what the kid was doing he was a let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something
but not a lot I could do about it
we had the problem when I was teaching I was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with and if we did have a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there
and you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like maybe just going ahead and trying to teach them was better than have them taken out because that just that doesn't do a lot for them it alleviates your problem
but it doesn't do anything for them
most the time if they were some of them were even better behaved I've only had two instances where it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were I don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on but it ended up better but I don't know guns and I don't know it's something
I think there's a problem too with teachers trying to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics they've been a big drive especially in the seventies to return back to the basics
and I'm not completely just teach the basics in schools but I think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our lower grades in the standardized test and such
it's indicative across the board that we've done something wrong
and when you see koreans and chinese and japanese who are taking all the science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs and here we are we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator I don't know
I spent a year and a half in japan also and I've seen how their school system works and I they go by a complete rote system you just memorize everything
and then at the end of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be
so I don't completely agree with that either
but there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere
that's a great deal what law school's like is it?
is that what you ended up going into?
and I did the same sort of thing they just you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one examine for the whole semester
and it's how well you can remember it all
how much can you stuff in your brain and I found that a particularly useless way of studying
I never did I always tried to understand things not tried to memorize
and consequently some of the very best students had excellent memories but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned
it didn't show me anything a year and a half I gave it up I wasn't really I didn't want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree
I don't know what can we do about it? good question
probably money is not the answer taking
there's plenty of money in the system
it's just they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse
I think it's like a lot of things in the united states we've got so much built up in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it
and in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that that can be done
not without wiping out a whole generation of kids in the school system
maybe on smaller scales I don't know I as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now
and I think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school
it's silly that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline
right into the classroom it needs to be able to be enforced
teachers are so afraid now of even saying something to students because they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something
it's like doctors in lawsuits
they're kind of fearful of everything
lawyers help create that
that's at least I've heard that I haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's been applicable to me
but I think what we've turned the school schools into now are just day care centers
somebody we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he's out of our hair
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents they're just
it has to be reinforced in the home I you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's not going to help either
so I don't know I don't know I don't know what the answer is
it's an interesting thing you want to do I how is texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it?
they allow it under certain circumstances you have to prove that you're teaching them something you have to follow a preferred curriculum
they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored they will allow you to I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that
I don't think they're were in this area but they are monitored by the state school board
that's interesting I remembering reading a few cases about that when some people first tried that and they got sued got taken to court by the school system
I'm glad the parents won it seems silly that we started that's the way you got your education in this country and then what was one of the latest ones that you've seen actually?
I think we rented pretty woman a couple months ago
the last two years I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home I've become available to come and go more often
so I said it's worth it I'll just go at the matinee hour and I can see what I please
it's no more costly than renting one the last I went about two or three weeks ago and saw f x two and that is a really good movie if you like special effects kind of gory and lots of action
I have not done that one I don't know if I have even heard of that one do you know that I don't follow performers
I don't follow actors some I know some I don't
and he was but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in the one about the old people cocoon? cocoon
he was a blond haired heavyset alien in cocoon
I don't know what his name is
I think I know who you are talking about though at any rate I also saw not long ago once around that was with richard dreyfuss
and that one was just a very poignant story it had people a lot of people said it was a really funny movie but it was a poignant humor
and it was like steel magnolias the characters played very well off one another
and there was humor involved but the story was a very dramatic story and I enjoyed it very much what are some others that you have seen lately?
I'm trying to think just the other night on h b o we watched the hunt for red october again and that's one that that's one I can watch over and over and over again
I was going to read while it was on but then when it started I just couldn't read that was a really good movie it sure was and the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it there are a number of good movies like that
there's quite a few movies out now that I would like to go see my husband is not a real big movie goer
and I guess more than anything that is why we don't go
plus by the time you get a baby sitter and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive you don't work?
I stay at home you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day
go during the day that's right that's right there's nothing wrong with that go in the early hours it's a matinee it's not crowded and the price is as reasonable as renting a video
and that's the way I do it and I go quite frequently
if you are going to be planning on doing that I was warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a witch hunt that is magically shot into the present time
and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie I was very well persuaded to walk out very well persuaded there was more gore than I was interested in seeing
but as the movie settles down to a comfortable action I can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either but the action was comfortable
and of course I enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so I enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully
but in the first scene the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet
and I could not handle that I said I'm glad I have not had dinner' then I saw awakening that's a wonderful wonderful job by robin williams and peter de niro I robert de niro? robert de niro what did I say peter? I think you said peter I said robert de niro
and he has done a really good job of characterizing the disabled person
and of course robin williams always just has an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing even when he's sad you great faith that he will get happy again
and then there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos I guess I can wait another month and they will be videos
one is silence of the lambs I've heard a lot about that one they say if you really want some suspense that's the one to see and I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television
I think I read about that too and then thelma and louise I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie it's about time for one of those I want to go see that
and I'm going to try to get in dances with wolves
you haven't I've heard that is wonderful I've heard it's wonderful too but it's just that they are both very long movies
and the matinee starts before I can get away from work
and after that I get involved in other things and don't want to go back
I've heard that's we rented the other one I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately was presumed innocent with harrison ford I guess he's in there
and I thought that was really good I saw that and I can not remember too much about it
it was the one where he was a defense not defense he was a cuter
and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the d a s office
and then he ended up being accused of it that's right I remember now I remember
so it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was I've had a hard time enjoying harrison ford in anything since the indiana jones movies I think he ought to stay indiana jones I realize that he would like his career to develop but I don't want to see him in other things but I tell you sean connery in the hunt for red october I never did care for him in the james bond movies I don't know he was too
I was never into those movies either I didn't care for the type of movie but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and I didn't like him but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older
I thought he looked real good with a beard too he does and there's a I don't know I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not
and he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time and I enjoy those and I enjoy some of the michael j fox movies I didn't care too much for the last one either it just was not enough to it
what was the last one? I'm trying to think
the last back to the future then was the last one it was called hard way where he was an actor trying to portray a policeman trying to and that what kind of lawn and garden work do you do?
right now the place where I'm living the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty five years so I've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn and after three years of working at it I've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back instead of mowing in the same direction every time changing one time you'll cut the lawn the long way then you'll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width and it helps the grass come back does it really? I didn't know that you've been working on it for three years?
for three years what have you done? killing lots of fire ants I was firmly convinced the entire front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound
because it was like you couldn't even stand still out there I can barely hear you
is this better? a little bit
it was like you'd go out in the yard to water something you'd just be standing still
and the ants would start crawling up your legs it's like I'm not standing in a mound though how did you get rid of them? dursban two
a chemical called dursban two dursban two
it's a crystal dursban will get rid of just about anything so you haven't had a problem with that since?
not bad every once in a while you'll have a mound pop up
but that's to be expected did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to? not really
as far as I can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed to even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it didn't kill it
that's pretty wild we used it for fleas we had fleas in our yard real bad last year and we did that I'm not basically I like to mow the lawn believe it or not but I sometimes have problems starting the mower so a lot of times I won't get out and do it but my husband basically does most of it and he does the edging and all that kind of thing and we're renting and so we don't really put a lot of money into the this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some saint augustine we have winter rye out back and we have I don't even know what it is out front but this is the first house we've ever lived in and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting I guess? so it
you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard? we were getting
I found one thing that it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn but every time I've done it it drives the fleas completely out of the area what?
powdered sulphur I wonder why it does?
you don't have to put a whole lot out just if you've got a broadcast spreader I think it comes in a forty pound bag
and it's real fine like flour
and you just go out and do the entire yard
and you don't have to put clumps of it just very lightly cover the entire yard I'll have to remember that because hopefully we won't have them this year but we have a cat that comes in and out and the cat was getting fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was quite a drag because we got them in our house and we're christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we don't want them back this year? so I'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard we're almost they were so bad last year even ticks I don't know we've had ticks before a lot and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that I think we used dursban and diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing and spread it all out everywhere but that's about the extent of our lawn care so I don't know do you enjoy doing it?
I love it my wife can't understand it'd be a hundred degrees outside I'll be out there but it's too hot to be working in the yard
I'm under the trees I'm having fun and I'm stopping to drink water so what's the problem? that's funny not everybody enjoys it though everybody has a different thing I kind of enjoy it and my husband doesn't I kind of have to sometimes I'm too busy to get out there and do it and he doesn't really enjoy doing it but he'll do it and he doesn't gripe about it or anything but I'm kind of like you and he's kind of like your wife in that he doesn't really enjoy it but I would like to have a garden that's my thing but right now where we're living we have the trees where their roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground I don't know what kind of trees they are but you can't have a garden you can't till it or it'll tear up a nice tiller so we're going to wait until we move we don't have a lot of sun either because it's big trees back there so we're going to wait and when we move that's one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a garden and so I'd like to do that I have a feeling I'll be out there all the time taking care of that but that's our next thing do you have a garden?
I've got the this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at sitting on about a two acre lot now
and the back half is my garden are you kidding? that sounds fun where do you all live? in missouri city
southwest side of houston southwest where?
southwest houston because we're in dallas I guess I assumed you were here that's neat and that's what we want we have a that's really what we want but we just haven't been able to do that yet so one day we'll be able to do it and I'm excited about it and then I don't know anything about it I have to learn and then you'll have to give me a call on gardening
what do you do in your garden and I'll go nothing what should I do? but I guess that's about it though it sounds like we've covered all the bases so I guess we'll let you go and do you have anything else you wanted to say?
it's just I've had an very enjoyable conversation with you I know you too I hope you have a nice day and we'll talk to you later you too
what do you think is the biggest problem?
the biggest problem in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that you can throw money at it
but it's I don't know to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way because the general values that we're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school
do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home
the values more or less at home and the t v just a general learning is not a revered endeavor really it's a lot more it's socially unacceptable but whereas in a person that they put a lot more emphasis on athletics and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society and I think that carries over to school a lot
so I think that the biggest problem is with the home environment being part of it if I think too many parents expect the school to teach the moral aspects of things to the kids while we're not going to worry about teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that and then expect them to pick it up at school you're not going to do that you're going to carry to school out into the world what you learned at home and I think that that part of that showing up now with things because kids have probably less respect for people in other things than we may have seen in the past
and part of it's the family I think and part of it's the living conditions certain people are subjected too drugs is a big problem now and I think that's another root problem
I wonder if that's a root problem or not because I think about that a lot and it's just like everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now but I wonder do you get the that's kind of side tracked but I just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better
I thought of course they're doing better and not so much when I was growing up catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools but they still had a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material everybody that went to a catholic school at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it
and I wonder if not so much that I think like you say it's the socioeconomic mix they're you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids that might be more well off going to a private catholic school or whatever and they're not all that way but some that are they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city public schools
this is interesting because in my mind I don't have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but this was actually inner city
people were sending just because their kids had the ability and the drive to try and get an education they didn't send him to a public school like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance in a lot of cases like that if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education I think it shows that the parents have some desire for the kid to do well and that may be passed on down to the kid as well and maybe they pick up on that
and then from the other aspect maybe the school itself has more emphasis on trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller they may be able to give the resources that's needed to do a good job
I mean and what would you do to fix the school systems? that's a tough question how to fix the school system
with I would try to see about getting parents more involved with try to come up with more ways to do that stress the importance of education to both the parents and the students and more classes that are and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of morals trying to teach the kinds of things that aren't getting taught at home and respect for other people I think that's a big part of it people if you don't care about property and people you're not going to care about learning
you're not going to really care about yourself
that's what I was going to say it's the chicken and the egg thing I wonder a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise
and you get it's been a while since I been in high school they're even in grade school when they do that but I can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that but you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school and I but that's not an easy task that's why I say it's a tough question what would you do because even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when you're growing up in a home which may be just the pits and you don't have any kind of a good environment to live in it's kind of hard to say you need to take care of other people's stuff as well when you barely have anything yourself so
I could see where that would be a problem and I think it's
that made a nice ugly sound so your name is lynn? linda linda
sounds like you like to read I read quite a bit probably don't read as much as I would like to
I don't read as much as I would like to either I'm a single mom but I have always loved reading
what do you like to read? I'm a therapist by trade so most of my books are what you'd call self improvement type of books
that what I've been reading lately a lot of my interests switch around dramatically I used to read just mainly fiction and now like a said I've read a lot of self help books what kind of things have you read?
I read all kinds of things for helping people survive a divorce
the road less travelled was probably one of my favorites have you read that? I haven't gotten through it yet you haven't?
what would you recommend? as far as dealing with divorce?
I'm kind of getting that one past me but a good self help book good self help
probably the best one that I know of and I work with all the time is called search for significance by robert mcgee that sounds good
and it's one that we use in our work it's probably one you'd find in a christian book store I don't know what the chains are down there maybe in the mall family book store something like that
I'm writing it down that sound really good what kind of counseling do you do or should we stay on the topic of books? probably should stay on the topic but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read I'm a therapist for rossa it's a christian treatment organization
and because of that I work with adolescents specifically so I see a lot of kids with various problems right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues
I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen
that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that sometimes it's rewarding and sometimes it's a struggle
I'm sure I'm sure what is that just the only type of reading you've been doing or have you read any good novels lately? I guess I've got so many books like that that I need to read it's hard for me to do a lot of reading just for enjoyment just joy reading
I hear you there that's for sure in fact
I guess the last book I've read my oldest daughter had to read lost horizons for her english class
and I just realized I had never read it growing up so I just finished reading that for enjoyment that's neat
and it was good she didn't enjoy it much so I didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her but I thought it was real interesting I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college because I enjoyed some of those stories so much
but I never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading I know
I trying to think of some of my other favorite books but I keep lists I must have a list of two hundred three hundred books that I want to read
just I want to read that and I write it down I've got a stack next to my bed
so do I I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book and then I get distracted or have to start on another one it's pretty tough to keep up with I was trying to think of I've got a copy of the road less travelled but I was trying to think there's another scott book that I've got that I had read
he also wrote people of the lie that's the one I was thinking of
I bought that one and I didn't get involved in that one as well there's another one he wrote that even sounds better and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace and building communities
someone just recently said something really neat about that I got involved in beginning experience weekends and it was of the people from there that said that his latest book is just excellent and his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects and he did mention beginning experience weekends as one of the places
so I've that's interesting
it really was a real fun bunch of books that I read the beginning of last year were I can't think of his name is it? pardon me?
it'll come to me but he wrote the illusion and a bridge to forever those are mind expanding books
his concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of I can't think of what his name is right off the bat though but they were fun they were real just books for fun
have you been involved on the switchboard long? not very long I really just started
how did you get involved? my wife has been working for t I
I see I'm a former t I er I just recently quit and so I got myself involved in a sales job and right now my list of books to be read have to do with the art of selling
I was just thinking at rossa they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with
so I keep getting stacks of books I need to read and I don't know when I'm going to get to them all never never there's never going to be enough hours in the day I don't think so
even if you took speed reading I don't think so
so I'm trying to think of what other kind do you like to read mysteries a little bit
do you like ken? trying to think
he writes spy novels the eye of the needle
and I really have found his books enjoyable I like that kind of stuff I think the last novel I read I read in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year it was a it's called this present darkness
it's kind of unusual book it's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that
that sounds interesting it sounds really good you should make yourself a promise that you'll read one novel in the next six months just for you
it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or self improvement and you kind of forget the fun of reading that's true
very easily so I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly
I think so too and I thank you for calling nice talking to you linda
and I'll have to check out that book you told me about
hope you like you it thank you you take care you too
my personal opinion I don't mind paying taxes necessarily I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way
sometimes when I hear what they're even what the politicians are making when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them and that's all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars that's is just being thrown away
and then when you read about that they're spending all the money on these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too
but somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government
and I tend to agree with that
I'm not really into what they're doing per se
and I think there's just too many levels of bureaucracy I think it can be managed by less levels I know any time there's a big budget cut I work with the state and any time there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that gets hurt
it's never the person that's making a hundred thousand there it's always the person that's making the least amount and sometimes we're running around there
I see these supervisors running around having meetings I really don't know what they do
I sometimes wonder are they really doing anything or
I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government I don't know what level or how long it will take for the public in general to start saying this is too much we're not going to pay any more we're not going to pay for this and you're out I think we're starting to see it a little bit now but I think I don't know what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it because I think we're just getting taxed way too much
right now we're getting taxed probably around thirty five percent or more and that's me not making a whole lot of money they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store something like that and you're paying a little tax here and you
so gas I don't know about you guys but there's probably at least about twenty five to thirty cents of different taxes on our gas
and you don't realize
we got a sales tax our sales tax is eight percent and I don't know what our gas tax is I think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon
so they're hitting us up and they may not raise it federally as much one year but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever it's just you can see that your money is just not going that far I know with reagan they say no new taxes but they changed the deductions on you and that just raises your taxes they just get it a different way
so to me it did raise my taxes
you could tell just by how much money you have left over and all of a sudden it's eating me alive I heard someone say that if they would just something with the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
tell me some about your camping experiences carolyn
I have gone to girl's camp a few times as a chaperon or a leader whatever
and I enjoy camping I we have a tent and we've gone even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove I guess my biggest memory is when we froze to death we just didn't take enough blankets and whatever where do you go camping at around here?
we went camping at lake bonham which is pretty close here we went fairly early in the season for this area which is probably april is when we went
and it got really cold at night and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning
but what activities do you do when you're camping?
we take little nature hikes and we take along games that we can play with the kids and just that kind of stuff usually try to have occasionally a camp fire at night and roast the marshmallows and what all
that sounds like fun I grew up in south dakota up in the black hills
and so we used to go camping my dad would take us there was four of us kids he'd take us and we'd all go camping my dad and my mom and the kids and it was always fun because what I always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot and he'd always tell us look for a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents and it always had to be somewhere near a river so we could go fishing and hopefully we'd catch our supper but we never did
but it was always fun we'd always mom was always prepared and she'd bring along something because tradition had it we would never catch anything so we always had something along to eat
but then we'd roast marshmallows and it was always an enjoyable experience about nineteen eighty two I moved from rapid city in the black hills I crossed the state to aberdeen and there's no hills it's flat and then I was in high school and couple of my high school friends and I we'd go camping out by a river of course and go fishing but by then of course I was able to catch some things but it was always fun it was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river
in the hills we would do like you folks did would take the nature hikes and look for animals and we always in the hills you can see quite a few different animals but go ahead
we used to live in utah
and of course there's lots of mountains around there to camp in and streams and stuff that's a great place to go camping and the hiking is just really great hike up those mountains is just really fantastic
are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area
I'm not acquainted with any I there's woods and things out in east texas tyler area
there's a tyler state park that's really a nice camping area but it's just a lot of trees it's not I don't know of any place in texas that has really big mountains I
the rocky mountains are so much bigger than anything that they've got down here that
the one in tyler has it been pretty commercialized?
it's not too bad they have screened in areas they're not really cabins I wouldn't say I guess they could call them that but they're more just a screened in camping area whatever
they're not bad helps keep the pests out I suppose
that sounds I don't know if I can rate camping but it sure beats driving a thousand miles to find a mountain I guess
that's right I take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area we just moved down in june
I see you're just trying to get over the culture shock still I'm still trying to find my way around if I can get on central from anywhere I'm happy
really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring and in the fall
it just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly there's a lot
there was a crime here in mckinney a rather heinous murder
there was no remorse shown by at least one of the perpetrators
and yet for whatever reason his crime was not considered a capital crime
and quite honestly I feel very strongly that the man has no redeeming social values and if and when he gets free again he will have no compunction but to continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again
so it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever I think that I don't know I don't think our prison system isn't set up where we rehabilitate or restore anybody
I think it'll only make them worse but I believe that god can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it but that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person and you're found to be guilty I believe god establishes the authority of our court system and I do believe that capital punishment is uh alternative even god can still change your heart but that doesn't mean like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you get your life right with god but you still have to pay your visa bill
that's right you still have to but god sent us his grace and they give pardons but I believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine and those prison people they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character they see that
but and I worked in a prison in fort worth
did you? I have a degree in social work you see it the ones that have a genuine character change
it is obvious and they know that they're not going to pardon someone from the governor you know what I'm saying they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so I feel like there is occasions where they do spare lives and I leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be reelected so
but my concern is that not all persons who I think should be receiving capital punishment punishment
thank you I'm sorry I just got home from work and I'm just kind of spaced out a little bit that's okay
that not all of them are being convicted of it that they're not even being charged with that I agree with you that a person's heart can be changed
but the same god that can work that miracle also established the laws that said for certain kinds of sin certain kinds of breaking of the law there would be a capital punishment
right then it was almost immediate
as soon as the trial was over then it was stoning but in the old testament
we don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth
we don't we definitely have lost the judeo christian ethic of the judicial system for sure but the base is still there the foundation is still there though of the system but I know what you're saying but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law we've just been taken out from under a law because under the law if your child back talks you he would be stoned
that's correct under the law he would be stoned so we've been removed from being under the law but we're still accountable to it we don't need to back talk but it's like god changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the old testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it but in the new he's looking at your heart and so I guess that's what I mean by their character changes and what I mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here and then any of if I don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused I believe for murder rape incest things that will permanently damage the character of the child
I believe crimes against children should be punished by death sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character
I tend to agree on that very strongly and that's where we just have to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was run like that I don't there would probably be very few exceptions to that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly because the judicial system they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much
plus all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the civil things that clog the courts
and having sat on both uh criminal and a civil jury some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time
because we're suit happy
but back to the capital situation sounds like you and I have a lot of common ground at least as far as capital punishment is concerned
I would like to see some kind of reform or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is convicted and sentenced to death that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with
and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years anybody him could be a her
but I know that they have crimes punishable by death and I'm sure they hit a few every now and then and I wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty but I know that they have their crime rate it's not jamaica I don't think I can't remember which it's one of the caribbean islands and singapore is it like that? my husband's going singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's when you have lawlessness the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we went on a mission trip to manhattan and to the bronx and stuff two years ago and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack and everyone was out we were across from that big bus station I forget what you call it but and they had fifteen people lined up on the fence and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing
and you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days
that's sad because the answer is not being given to them in the court system and I think initially when our country was set up it was set up with god and it was really an integral part and you can't force people but I think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see I don't know I guess I'm kind of frustrated that we've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded upon it reeks of the bible just the whole system and so I feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon para church ministry to come in and do it that the system itself you know what I mean
I feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include expediting the penalties and just getting it over with
however certain very liberal minded groups who do not subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do such as the civil liberties unions and so forth will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side
because too too often there can be extremism that hurts from any direction regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about
I know you're right they would lobby that and I see that and that's why I'm what's my role in this thing what's my part
because I don't think the system is going to get fixed I think it's crippled
do you subscribe to magazines yourself?
I don't subscribe to any magazines at home because we get so many at work that I need to read that I just don't take any at home I see I get mccall's of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest
and then once in a while I'll pick up a working woman or something and realize why I don't want to go back to work what I enjoy about staying home
and I read magazines mainly because they're fast and if I want to relax while I watch t v of course I'm one of those that does two things at once and I read good housekeeping and better homes and mccall's and I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject
I used to take mccall's and good housekeeping and several magazines like that a few years ago at home and then you stopped them all
but the subscriptions ran out and I never renewed them and I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work to read them I find that about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular
and then I kind of get turned off by it other than good housekeeping
good housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for when I'm really have time and I really want to read something
I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with on a general basis
and we travel a lot so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various different ones
and I get into newspapers so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am I'm read it fast and put it down
when I had my magazines at home I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures and if something caught my eye then I might read something
but otherwise than that they were not too useful to me that's what I do I got some good recipes from them sometimes but you clip recipes and you save them forever and you never really use them that's right that's right and then every so often you weed through them and you think where did I ever put that recipe
but that's mainly my whole idea on short subject reading and things like this
I subscribe like I said to a few and once in a while I buy that new magazine called first on the newsstands or something like that
but I kind of stay with my own subject matter what pertains to my daily life at the present time
since I work with computers during my work I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything and I have to read the magazines such as byte and computer world and mac world and all of these magazines such as that so I really just I can see that it will be a very long time probably before I subscribe to any magazines at home sometimes if you're in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that
but I think and the idea is I can just dump them at the other end and I don't have to carry them back with me that's right I do that when we travel I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we
no matter what it is air travel or anything and I
if I go on an airplane ride or something I'll stop in and pick up a cosmopolitan or something to read on the airplane although now
but that's basically just about I'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then that's when you really have time your computer ones I got into computer work somewhat we have our own computer system at home
and I tried reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along
it was kind of a little bit more than what I needed so I never did get into them when I bought the computer all of a sudden I was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail I think they all thought we have a live one she'll subscribe
but they were wrong I never got into them but
I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point
it was nice talking with you
it was nice to talk with you too thank you
that's okay tell me about your home it looks like a little shot gun house almost it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other
it's an older home it's not new I like it though it's big
what kind of square footage? I wouldn't know I measured it one time because we had saw some termites
and we thought about getting it sprayed I think it was I can't remember I'm sorry that's okay that's okay it's big enough for us though
we kind of need maybe one more room we've got two children
so where do you live at what part of town here in denison that's north
or down here in denison I live in plano so it's north to me
up here then I say down I'm really from kentucky
I was going to say you didn't have the typical you have a southern accent
but you don't have a texas accent
I'm originally from ohio cincinnati
so I'm familiar with that area that dialect
also I lived in georgia for about four years so the there's a difference too between east and west in the south and the way in which people speak
anyway my home I guess it's about twenty five hundred square foot and I have four bedrooms at the present we're busting out walls and things like that that's what I want to do how many kids do you have? we have two we have two do you have enough bedroom space then?
we'll have enough bedroom space it's we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small and so we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit that's kind of like what we'd like to do we just had a baby a couple months ago and we've got a den it's more or less a spare room
we rarely go in there except for to play chess
we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter and we need the one extra room like you said the bedrooms are too small the living room and kitchen are huge
but the bedrooms are too small where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way you can't rearrange it at all
there's they I know what you're saying there ours is the same and they tend to put windows in the strangest places
we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom
you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything so no privacy
we don't have a lot of that we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house it
I'd hate to clean these windows I really would
I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean ours are the double pane and you can't really clean them on the inside ours are those too you must live in an older home too then
I do the house is almost thirty years old
so it's not a new home it's seen some wear and tear ours has too when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it
and he did it hisself so most of that by now is falling apart
it's not just horrible but this tile's come loose off the wall the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile and I don't like that at all
that is awful with the great big square tiles that you put on the floor the huge one
he did it in that? instead of wallpaper I wouldn't mind it if it was short tiles for that you put
the normal tiles that you put around a bathtub that would be prettier
but this looks like floor covering on the wall it just doesn't look good
and also they're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier there's one big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on so
and he rewired the house and it's shorting out here and there and
I that's one of the things we've been fortunate with is our wiring is okay we don't have enough power or our breakers aren't powerful enough to really help with the load in the house
we need to redo some rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work
and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street
and it can be really bizarre and we never know where it's going to flood we've got power surges on the west side of our house we've got our stereo hooked up
that the power makes it run it's never ran it's always ran just fine the clock and stuff
but it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month the clock ran normal
and then the power went off again lightning or something knocked it out and we hooked it back up and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again
but on the east side of the house it runs fine
you do have a strange wiring problem there he put new wiring in it's all new wiring up in the attic or crawl space
but he didn't know what he was doing he really should have hired people
that's something my husband's in construction and he won't even touch electrical stuff he he'll do a little things but he won't do any major rewiring
he says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it he'll end up killing himself
end up killing theirselves that's right my husband he'll change out a light switch but that's about as far as he'll go
that's the way mine is
he said he went up in the attic and looked around and he was he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry was a what
the roof was really sorry when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was
it was a wood shingle roof and we the first year we were living there we had to replace the roof he put which I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles is it three or five your husband probably knows
he probably knows I don't know what it is off hand he's got seven layers of shingles up there and he told us it was a completely new roof like I said he didn't know what he was doing
he must not of we stripped ours off we didn't put it over'cause we put composition roof on and we completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up put the paper down and just started from scratch
unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain
we had almost about half of the roof off and it did this and a house full of snow
and a house full of snow and rain
and it came down it did this in the middle of the night we have plastic just tied down on everything as best we could real thick edge stuff
and the wind came in from the north and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night and we were asleep and I woke up and I got up and it was about four o'clock in the morning and I heard all these drips
I had water coming in every light fixture that
I had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling everywhere and it filled up my light fixtures because they're the old kind
and I would go in and I'd turn on a light in the room and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of water and the light would still come on it didn't blow up or anything a friend of mine when I lived in louisiana her we all lived on base my husband was in the army
she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning water dripping from hers the neighbor's washing machine had over done something I don't know but it was leaking just pouring water in and it all went through to her roof and it was coming out of the lights fixtures
the fire alarm went off for some reason it shorted it out or something
that will happen so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house not six feet but
but it's quite a bit quite a bit you know that you might as well so did you have carpets and stuff?
several of our rooms got ruined we have we are on pier and beam we don't have concrete slab underneath our house
so it got into the carpeting got into the floor the carpeting was already awful anyway but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too
they came in and they had it one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it we had to call the insurance company the insurance company was paying for the new roof but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired which really wasn't our fault
we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather and stuff that's right that's right
and you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end
it are you finished with it now? the roof?
it's been done for quite some time we're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof how long have you lived there?
it's three it's just been at three years we've been in the house just the three years we've been doing a lot of remodeling it had a detached garage and my husband's built a walkway across and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that so we you all did it yourselves?
the walk? the home improvements
he does this for a living this is what
this topic is is russia a threat to our security? I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time how do you feel about it?
they do have a major internal problem everybody wants to defect and I can understand why I think their biggest problem is just obtaining food to live so when you have the basic needs being unmet I don't think you think globally as far as being a threat to other people in the world
so as soon as they get their own home country taken care of then they'll consider what they can do with the rest of the world
I believe communism is very much waning it's pretty much on the way out of the door insofar as the strong hold that they used to have and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world and their rebellions right now is the result of that if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side I think that it will be on the way out eventually it's just a matter of time because in the baltic states they have already massacred so many people who protested
and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy regarding the outcome of their affairs what's your synopsis?
I do realize that the bush administration isn't too happy with how they're handling their internal strife as far as diplomacy is concerned I think it's been a good positive direction for the soviets as far as yeltsin is concerned he was allowed to in the congress they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned which gives him more power overall which I think is a good sign that there will be some politically speaking he's going to have more power and I think it's a step in the right direction I think gorbachev realizes that he's got a major power figure competing against him and I think it's going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with yeltsin as far as realizing he does realize it with the fact that they increased the prices on their food and goods
it I think that it went up a thousand percent on most
that's incredible but they had to go in the direction of a market driven economy and they had to bite the bullet for that so that's a good move on gorbachev's part in doing that
but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that he's moving towards a two to three party system of government nor eliminating or diminishing the communist power
and I guess that's where yeltsin steps in so far as his politics of government goes but I don't know how convinced the people are of him yet myself
that's all they got right now that's their ray of hope
so they'll go with whoever comes through for them
it's just that the weird thing is is that gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates as far as with glasnost and perestroika and stuff
and I think he's got between the old guard and the new glasnost I think it's kind of escalated to a point where it's out of control
and I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on both sides so I think that's kind of where he's stuck you know what I'm saying? I understand
and that's the situation that he finds himself in and he's a tough guy he's been through it so I have no doubt that he'll I think overall he's been a good figure for the soviet union I think his intentions and his ideals are well intentioned
and in the long term but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have I think that makes the problem most severe and makes him look worse that what his ideals are personally I agree what's bad for the soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should
I think it's a lot of bureaucracy and one thing and then all the corruption I think there's a large amount of corruption on the have and the have nots that's probably more true than a lot of people realize
I know you're going to have that with every society
at least we're more blatant about it but it's very secret and it's been going on for years you can't change things overnight
but if it gets to a point where people can't survive there's revolution and that's it seems to be headed in that direction too
big time major but that's what happens when the cork blows and you can't handle it anymore that's the way the world revolves that way their knowledge with better communication processes in this world now that's reached them is more educated to the ways of the western world
I really question though how much technology the average soviet is exposed to and I think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things too they probably not enough but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind of what they're missing out on
I think they're starting to realize but I just don't think they have the resources if you were to compare the americans to the soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fax machines and cellular phones and state of the art equipment that we are so used to I don't think they even realize what's out there and to what extent I'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items
the major conveniences of life what we consider just normal everyday things to them is real luxury which is unfortunate for them
and of course most of us we don't really appreciate what we've got because we've been so used to it
this is true this is very true and we it's human nature though to take things for granted and it kind of
when you've lost something or don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize what's out there and what you have and what you don't have I agree
so the original question do we think they're a security threat?
I can go with that answer too the only yes I could go to is if a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange but I don't even see that occurring because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to
I don't really feel that the soviets really want to blow up the world we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as nonfeeling machine type people and they're people just like us they get up everyday and they put their pants on the same way and they have to eat and everything else and I just don't feel that
how do you feel about capital punishment?
I just last friday got off a capital murder case you did? I was on the jury
which is funny because I got called last night and the topic was something about juries
so I am just hitting it right how do I feel about it? I don't know I guess it is right in certain cases
the one I was just on I don't I was an alternate on the case so I don't know what was decided
they are probably still in deliberations on it
but what I found out once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed we met with the judge the two alternates did
and he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy and I remember hearing about it it was about a year ago he was involved in another capital murder the very next month and he was caught just they drove up the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy
so he was caught and it's interesting because the county I live in I'm not in dallas county I'm pretty far north of dallas
county I live in the past ten years only had two capital murders
and last year there were six and this guy is indicted on three of them
so you have to wonder
the cases like that they should
if he's going to be drastic somebody has to be drastic back
although it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him he has no concept of what he has done
he just from what I can tell I didn't talk to the guy or anything but he doesn't seem to have any regard for anybody's life including his own
so it's kind of strange that no remorse whatsoever
I guess in cases like that where the guy would obviously go out and do it again you've got to do something
it's funny because when they interview you before you go on the jury for capital murder I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours
and I the I was the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed you're kidding
but at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt and I said I can't imagine I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it I guess I could convict him but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something
but they really did it was really amazing
I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun
that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about and those jurors don't know about
but this particular case they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that the police hadn't released
so no one else would have known
it was really pretty interesting what educational I guess cases like that I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case
they can in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been found guilty of it of that crime
but he was found guilty of
so it's although it's not going to take much to prove that that works
so they pushing the death penalty?
this guy is up for the death penalty
and in texas there is a couple of questions you have to ask in the punishment phase for example was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation and there is a number of questions and just depending on whether you say yes or no you can give him capital punishment and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment then you can look at mitigating circumstances so
so there is a lot of outs but the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much
and to me you take away a person's freedom you've taken away most of their life that's true if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole but
but then you have to look at reality I think normally they may get out so that's true
but what is it worth? I don't know
personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself that's true I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not or
you said you're from mississippi?
and do they have the death penalty there? they do I they've had a number of cases here
not a whole lot jackson had their sixty first murder this year
it was like last year they had forty nine so that's going up
but they have a death penalty I hear of one every now and then
and I visited the prison up here at parchman
and I've been I haven't they won't let you on death row but they'll let you look down the hall
you can't see any prisoners and it's kind of a weird feeling I've been
they took us around on a tour and I got to walk in the gas chamber
and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying people have died here
that's right but just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff the people up there
and what part of virginia?
I live down in the south western part of blacksburg blacksburg I've been
have you ever heard of virginia tech? sounds vaguely familiar v p I
I hadn't been down in that part of the state really
we vacation a lot how about you? quite frequently I wish we did we retired early
so we take trips pretty often where all you guys go?
we go to maine every fall
then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast
and I have a daughter in texas and one in new mexico so we go out there and we go to florida
and down we were just out recently at the outer banks of north carolina all these places that I've never been
is that right where do you go?
what type of vacation? it really depends seems like I do a lot in the midwest lately my fiancee's family's from wisconsin
and so we've been out there a couple of times and I went to purdue for a couple of years so I've gone up to indianapolis on occasion to visit friends
and I'm a real big baseball fan so I usually try to combine it with catching a couple of games somewhere
what club do you follow? I'm a big red sox fan red but I
me too you're a red sox fan too?
I usually try to catch whoever's in town though I don't specifically I go to cleveland to see them play the indians or the red sox
that's about it we do a lot of little trips around here and
ever go up in pennsylvania in the mountains or not that much we've gone out to a place in western pennsylvania called falling water
have you ever heard of it?
I've heard of it I've never been there it's really neat it's this house built on a waterfall and it's really cool
of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there
the first time we went out there was the day after hurricane hugo had come through
so they didn't have any power and it was really cold and rainy and we went up about a year later and it was better but not a whole lot better
so where else did we go we've gone to richland last year and had a good time down there did you? did you go to williamsburg
have you been down there? my girlfriend has with her sisters but I haven't been down there
I hear that's nice we're going to get probably down norfork sometime this summer just to catch a football game actually
we were down when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork and spent the night there with a friend in portsmith and then went to williamsburg and spent a night spend a day and a lot of money
I've heard I'm not real interested in williamsburg because of the price attached to it we just I
but it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around if you like to walk it's a good town to just walk in we'll do that you can go to the buildings and not go in if you're not
so I can wander around without
you can wander it's a good town to wander in I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings?
that's right I didn't know that I think they do the whole with paying
they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another
but they had a good time so
we really didn't do that really this time we just visited around
we've done it a couple of times and that's enough for probably another twenty years I was we use it live in california and my up around san francisco and there was one year when my father's company was starting to do stuff down in los angeles so my father was working down in los angeles for six months or so actually I think it was closer to a full year and he'd fly down there on mondays and fly back on fridays any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to los angeles so I went to disneyland about five times in one year
and I really have no great urge to go back now
that's great as a kid though isn't it it was great because the times that were really fun were when we had vacation but the kids in los angeles didn't
so we basically had one of the parks
there's still a lot of people at disneyland but there was another amusement park down there busch gradens there was nobody there when we were there we won a log floating ride five straight times we just get done with them and they go do you want to go again
have you ever you've never been down to epcot at florida and disney I'd like to sometime that's good but
we really enjoy that we've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter I've never been the fartherest south I've been on the east coast is charlotte
so I keep wanting to get further I thought I would go to florida a couple summers ago but never did it
charleston is a really nice place to visit my sister lives in charlotte and they've gone to charleston a couple of times and had a real good time
it's a real pretty place one of these days we'll get down there although I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it
we're getting married in about a year
are you and our honeymoon we're going up to this place in wisconsin called door county
it's up by green bay it's a place my girlfriend's also wanted to go and
is it on one of the lakes? it's I don't if you've ever seen a map of wisconsin but there's kind of a little thing sticking out in the lake michigan that's door county
that would be really nice
they call it the cape cod of the midwest
so we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun
she had this book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide
sounds good so that should be a lot of fun
I don't know what our next trip will be I guess our next I know what my next trip I'm going to be a grandmother in july the first one
so my next trip is going to be to texas that'll be fun
in the middle of the summer you won't even notice it though
they'll be air conditioning anyway so is that how you got into this data base?
my daughter's a temp at texas instruments and working on this project
I was just most of the people I've talk to are from texas
so when I heard you were from virginia I was there's somebody different and you said I got somebody down in texas I go that the connection right there that's it
I talked to one in california I never asked him the other day how he was connected I don't think he was t I employee I most people talk to texas there's been a couple of other the people most of whom are like me that work in speech labs that are going to use data base eventually
I see so it was fun actually yesterday I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in is that right
we spent last week end in charlotte with real good friends that had just moved back east from oklahoma
and she's working on this project too she's talking on the project too
and we got back monday and I got a call yesterday and it was her on t I network that's neat I haven't had something like that happen just getting the one guy from the lab
you're sure have a nice town my sister lives on lake norman just does she
that's nice out there we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer and it's never really works out it's real pretty
traffic not much else we do for vacation really just so we haven't been able to take really are you a golfer?
me either are you guys golfers or
not too much into sports except our outside though
just walking that's all I don't think there are any traveling that was in my early teens down in that area and I'm know real sure there are
no professionals I was thinking I might be minor league but
there's one in salem salem rebels salem rebels buccaneers
buccaneers I may be seeing them in a town just west of here frederick has a minor league team that plays in the same league with salem and I think we may be seeing them this weekend
is that right up there in frederick? I think they're out of town
that's a nice little town actually frederick
I've never been up there I've never visited baltimore I'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime there's some nice things in baltimore the inner harbor and the aquarium and all that are very nice
they've just done a I the aquarium is one of those things that because everybody where is your favorite place to go?
we haven't traveled outside the united states that much we usually take family type vacations we're looking forward to one in october to disneyworld in florida that's great we have a nine year old have you ever been there?
when both of my kids were much younger and this time we're going to be going with just one daughter and she's nine so it ought to just be a ball that's a perfect age for disneyworld
I think so too that's great so we've been there a number of times and we're going next year we have a business trip every fall we go on a lot of business trips I don't work
so you travel a lot we do we my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if I go along
so it's great I just kind of join up when it's something interesting and disneyworld is the one for a week next year
and it will be at this time of the year and this year matter of fact we're leaving next saturday for new orleans
that will be fun too have you ever been there?
we went years ago we haven't been lately and I know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there we went there once in fact we had been in dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to new orleans so when he said this year I have a week there on a project he's going to be and then I said I'll going along I hope it's swimming season because it wasn't a tremendous amount of things that I wanted to do there
if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there but that can be fun and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a mardi gras night planned
and I'm kind of anxious for that but yours to disneyworld sounds a little bit better did you know that next week there's several t v shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary
I know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind
be excited about all of it if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go
not really we're doing the same thing tying it in with my husband's business trip and I just save vacation for things like that and just travel whenever we can that's
I think travel when I heard my topic today I thought that's my favorite how easy
and really at our point of life our children are grown and it has just worked out really well with this position he's in because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have you
and it depends where he's going whether or not I decide to go along
but I do like to travel and it's I don't mind the pool life at all during the day
and I like to sight see and I love to shop it's
that's perfect what more could you ask for? that's right but it
and then got to pick and choose the places and one of my very favorite is las vegas
that I would have to say we both end up going to las vegas probably once every year and a half
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles
and so I've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with continental
and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental
it's kind of shaky and I said now that we have all the miles we better start using them that's true
it really is so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip when we normally go that way we like to go to california at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from texas
our last big trip we drove through new mexico and colorado and went to the grand canyon and back through silverton and durango and it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our I think that's a good trip
and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
we did what we sometimes do since we are in ohio and it takes a while just to even get to what I would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through utah and as far west as las vegas
and then we returned through new mexico that you just mentioned
and it was just great
there's too much to see really
I think that's the way to
I have a lot of different teams that I like to keep in touch with of course texas rangers being one of them you can't live in dallas without
what are the others? I originally came from saint louis so the saint louis cardinals are one I moved to kansas city I have a tendency to adopt teams when I go to a town
it's helpful so I lived in kansas city for a couple years and I adopted the royals I lived in houston for two and a half years so I adopted the houston astros so I've got quite a few
do you keep up with the statistical stuff? I don't get into that too much every once in a while I will keep in touch with maybe who's in the top five of hitting or something like that but I don't get into how many errors somebody has or things like that
there's a guy that was on show that I listen to going to work in the morning who does
it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games I've heard of that one
and apparently the rangers last year won a lot of one run games I didn't know that that's supposed to be a real good statistic
it is but it's a reverse indicator that's true they don't have the offense to get out or to have the more runs so
what the argument is and it's one of these statistical how can you draw a conclusion from it but they find that there's a connection between that and how they do in spring training the following year
and strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
which means that if you have a good year winning one run games that the following year you'll have a bad year and they've looked at twenty three teams and the statistics are something like twenty one out of twenty three it was which means the rangers are going to have a terrible year I which I was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth
and it's I don't know what do you think of incaviglia's loss I kind of think it was necessary I'm not a big pure power hitter anyway I don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time I think that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it but when you get two strikes on you you should shorten your swing a little bit if it's a perfect shot go for it but the strike outs were a big problem for him plus supposedly what I heard he was not much of a team player anyway so
it's an interesting concept though when you look at how apparently I was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going to sign him and the point of I don't understand the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that they can sign him tomorrow
and he could go in the team the next day and and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero that's true
and all he has to do is hit the ball you're not and all he has to do is hit it once it doesn't he can swing a couple times if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can
it's an interesting concept of how they do it but I agree with you I think that's part of what baseball needs more of I guess what bothers me is that when you go you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run and that's all the game is I'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people there's another point to that too they said that he was horrible at batting with men on base having somebody get up and hit a solo home run gives you run obviously
but if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs to be able to score enough runs to be able to win in this day and age so
how do you think the royals are going to do? I think the royals will do okay they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they're these cycle pitchers they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good saberhagen has won supposedly the cy I think he won cy two out of three years so he's very much due for a good year
are they going to beat oakland? that's a good question I don't know how oakland's going to react to being swept in the world series last year they could very easily take that as a challenge which is the way most teams naturally do and just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them so
I go to saint louis from time to time and I watch their sports up there and they're certainly intense about the cardinals they
baseball is their life up there like football is down here I think
did you actually live in saint louis? I lived in the suburbs of saint louis
everybody does that's true too I think that's all that they have
I had a friend from college that lives in it's on the west side everything's on the west side manchester? out that way
and I went and visited him but it is interesting how are the cardinals? do you still keep up with them or I definitely do in fact I've got family that still lives up there from what I hear from everybody up there they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go but I've been following spring training and they're one of the best teams in spring training so far
is that a good indicator? it can be it really kind of depends on what they were looking for in other words if in spring training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just come out and just won all kinds of games in spring training and then gone on a fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so
what I think is remarkable is it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have real breakthrough years
and the question is how do you forecast that you can't
if you had to bet on who would be in the world series it would be really tough I think the best thing that you can do is go with the players that have the talent to do the best years and that they hadn't had these gigantic career years yet and just kind of assume that one of them is going to break through eventually
and I think they said the reds this last year I'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years
and so they may be even better this year
when are the rangers going to come through that's a good question I the rangers have a pitching problem and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question they're doing the right thing though they are going with their farm system they're letting their farm system build up and stuff like that and
is there enough money that's part of it I that was part of skip bayless argument
I don't know if you read skip bayless a local commentary
and his argument is that the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars
that's probably true
would you agree with that? considering what I've seen in the last two seasons I'm beginning to agree with that but you don't have to spend the big money as far as I'm concerned to win you just have to spend it if it's necessary
in other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team then keep him there don't let him go away
and I think that's really what's been hurting the rangers
didn't kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff they spent more money last year than any other team in the league
and they were toward the bottom of the league so it's like I said spending money doesn't guarantee you winning a pennant
it really doesn't so
and I think that's maybe part of it that the and it if I owned the team I think you'd like them to do well but the question of losing big money that did steinbrenner actually make money on the you got me I think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything
it's a little bit like any other sport when it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game
and I guess as we get older you're probably going if you compare to go to a sport say you go to a rock concert or even a performance an opera or the symphony or something
if but how often do you do that
an I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there several times a that's the whole point there are so many games in a year that they've got to have repeat customers
they can't afford not to and that's one of the things that I think saint louis has done their ticket prices are as high as anybody else's but somehow or another they attract so many people from it's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than most other cities so
but don't you think there are older fans there I don't mean older the fact that it's better established and that the city is more of a
I've never done it before so I guess that's all I have to do
I guess so I've been called several times and I pushed in my number they kept saying you have the invalid code
and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right
so this is the first time I've even done it
I wonder how long it's going to be on for
I think five minutes is the max I mean this whole thing for two months or something do you know?
I don't know back to crime I guess we're supposed to talk about that
they say what aspect are you worried about I think at this point I for one am worried about every aspect
especially you since you're in the same metroplex there's so much going on here I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that's really something you got to protect yourself from
that and in the schools too starting to put metal detectors in I know and have they done that in garland?
I not that I'm aware of
I just heard last week at that one school they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
so we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the school grounds after school
is that right? and the one boy killed himself a few years ago in a grade school so these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any neighborhood doesn't seem like not at all
it's kind of scary to think you send your child to school and you wonder if he's going to get shot we didn't have to worry about that before I know what next?
I know it's getting it's been out of hand for a while and it just continues to get worse and we can't really depend on the police to solve all this they just can't do it
I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
and how we going to bring that back together
that's I I agree I think that's where it stems from is that and you've got a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children and
and that may impact it as well I think so and then there's a drop in the training of morals really
some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood they don't think twice about it
either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the I think it was just rare I really do
my mother when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in california and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both and
you're kidding I'm the one
himself and her? that must have been at least fifty years ago or more but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks
I bet but now you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas
I know it's just another killing
they were I was watching some show the other day and they were talking about mass murderers
and they brought up what happened in killeen here recently and they were saying that these guys want attention and that when it happens they're glorified because it's on all the newspapers and t v s and everything
lots of their picture and life story and everything
and then you get to their life story they came from a broken family
this person had mental problems I know how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
so that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin the same thing happened here in arlington to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with
is that right? I think it was on a hard copy she was a real attractive blond girl in her freshman year of college
and some boy she tried to get rid of he was in his twenties
I remember seeing that remember that?
I saw that on hard copy that's
my daughter graduated with her from arlington high school
is that right? can you believe it that's just
I'm trying to remember he had her in the car in front of a taco or something taco bueno
and he just shot them himself and her
I remember seeing that isn't that weird?
there's just too many crazy people out there these days I know and the police are not going to do anything until they've committed some sort of a crime he was just begging her on the phone that's not doing anything
and there are times I think I should give my kids how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home?
I don't feel very good about it but I think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore
he actually died a few months after that and so as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him?
the he wanted to get into a mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had a ten year waiting list
we wound up just choosing another mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into but naturally it was even mennonite related it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in so the convenience
what do you think? my grandmother lived with us until august and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia
and the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in dayton and were several thousand miles away
so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set
that's important I would say
and the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her
and I've got little children here who needed me here
so that she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day
and that becomes difficult then
she was falling down and hemorrhaging and all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though I would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore
we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
but he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain
and this eventually things just went too far
and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions it sure wouldn't have been granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now
that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing we enjoyed having her here
and but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does a nurse is right there to help her
and I know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
so I think she'll adjust do you have any hobbies?
I do what are yours?
china painting and ceramics how great
I enjoy it ceramic painting I enjoy the china more the china more and now that I have my eyes corrected to the point that I can see the delicate part of china painting I do enjoy it how did you ever get into that? that sounds so interesting my husband kept begging me and he's been dead now for twenty years so you understand that this was a long time ago but he finally brought me the china the book the brushes and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons how I
and I said I'll do it for three months and if I don't like it that's it I painted an awful lot until his death which was several years and it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable self satisfying thing I've had I do you do it just for yourself or do you do it to give as gifts or do you actually sell it?
I have sold quite a bit I give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it that sounds do you work outside of the home? I have just retired you've just retired what a great hobby it's not I it's a great hobby but don't retire don't retire
I don't I never returned to work for the I have stayed home for about the last nine years
have we've transferred around and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake on lake erie so the lake life appealed to me and my husband's working and he left it up to me if I worked or not
so in my spare time I love to sew there aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing but I do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home so I enjoy doing my toppers for my window applications and things like that
but just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great
my sister is the seamstress of the two of us but she doesn't china paint so we both have our expertise side that is excellent
what part of ohio are you in? I'm in the suburb of cleveland and I'm about fifteen miles probably from downtown cleveland something like that and cleveland is located right on lake erie and prior to this we were fifty miles west from here so we were right on the lake and cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard
what's that and you do find people into the crafts and various things for spare time but I have never heard and I have actually never run into anyone into the china painting and I'm just intrigued with it
if you ever start be sure and start with a large flat plate that way you can get the feel of you're not cramped on these smaller objects where you're getting into the delicate work
that's right where did you first get your lessons from?
in abilene texas through an adult ed or strictly a china type
she just taught china painting and how marvelous
then we had so much fun there I had a friend from albany which is about thirty six miles away and we would meet every thursday morning at our instructor's home because she did our firing for us and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies and it was just such a delightful time and then after I and it's so nice beg pardon? it must be so nice for you now that you're retired
I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband's death so I have put it aside for a little while but I have just found me an instructor to get started again isn't that great and you'll probably really regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a class again
of course I just have one beautiful with peonies umbrella stand and I have two daughters and they're both
what's your favorite baseball team rita?
I suppose I'm supposed to say the rangers is that what
is the million dollar question here? that isn't a true false or right or wrong test here
I would like to say the rangers but unfortunately they're not I was from illinois and my favorite team was the white sox not a cubbies fan
my dad was but I turned out to be a white sox fan that's all right I lived in chicago how do you expect them to do this year?
they did pretty well
what did you think of the world series? I'll tell you I just moved down from south dakota in july and in south dakota the minnesota twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living
and so everybody was a twins fan and I didn't have much interest in the twins it was kind of pathetic we only had two radio stations and one of them broadcast every twins game live and the other one was country so you didn't really have a lot of choice did you so that's right
there's was twins there or skip williams or country
and I was routing for the twins myself because a couple of ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here went to minnesota and we used to tease about my son and I used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to minnesota but it certainly was an exciting series anyway it sure was it sure was
what do you think going to happen to the rangers? I would like to assume that they're going to do better this coming year
or can we predict? I was sure hopeful anyway when we moved down I was able to go to my first baseball game and thought this is great this is incredible
so I became a rangers fan I didn't really have one in south dakota so I adopted the rangers or rather they adopted me I guess
and it was just exciting you can watch baseball on t v and they hit the long ball and it looks like they really hit that ball but when you go to the ball park it's really not all that far
and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you and
isn't it though but I think going to the ball park just really makes it because then you watch it on t v you feel like you're more a part of it too that's right that's right
I'm a great sports enthusiast so I love baseball teams and they in fact on the news tonight nolan ryan was on there he was put in the restaurant hall of fame the restaurant
the restaurant hall of fame inducted him tonight and he says he's coming back
he doesn't know how many years to pitch he'll be at least one more and he said he's been saying one more and it's been two and three might be two and three more he likes it that's right
and he's still doing great still doing excellent that's right
and he said I get a kick out of it he's such a nice man didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers?
and he when he quits at being active he will go into managing and being a coach I'm sure management
but he certainly is a good example for the kids that's right
you like to have someone like that you could point to say see what a fine man he is some of the ivan rodriguez wasn't even born when nolan ryan started pitching
that's right and it's just incredible to think that there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against nolan or with nolan
and now their sons are
he's been a legend for so many years and I don't know had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at u t with his son his son pitched for u t and he pitched for an exhibition game for the rangers I wasn't
it was a I think it was a little early part of the summer and nolan against was it nolan against ryan against ryan
ryan against ryan his son pitched for u t that is neat
and only ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing
a game is a game the rangers really knocked the socks off of them which you would expect anyway
but nolan took himself out after a couple of innings or something of the game so
quite a few and they're varied they don't encompass many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing
but I do quite a bit of wreath making and my dogs are my hobbies I do a lot of gardening I go to estate sales which takes up a lot of time
what do you mostly do?
mostly right now I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff that should be fun
fun for them how old are they?
I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three I think that's better than having that party at home
this is a friend's party and they rented or they the party they just rent skates and stuff for the kids
so they're looking forward to it and the skating rink does the rest practically I guess what a help that is so what kind of
how long have you lived in north carolina? not that long
just since october we moved here from enid oklahoma
so we're originally from virginia this part of the country
but we did spend twenty years in norman and enid and loved it
but we needed to get back to our older parents
but I am loving it the weather is divine
did you like oklahoma while you were there? very much
what did you all do? my husband was with university of oklahoma and phillips university in enid
and then he went with a family corporation that has oil and ranching and varied enterprises
and he just quit a perfectly good job and came we came east
so is he working there then or he's doing quite a bit of consulting work and has been offered a permanent position
and he's contemplating
he's liking this free time actually
it's just wonderful after all these years of working
how did you get hooked up with the t I switchboard thing? a gal who works with t I on this project
I think she's a temporary worker mother is my best friend in virginia
I see so we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country I see
my wife has talked more than I have she's talked to four five different people it seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from dallas in fact she's talked to a couple of people from north carolina I think what is her name?
her name's tina I haven't talked to her I haven't talked to a tina yet
the call was probably for her they wouldn't accept my t I n number so we put hers in but like I said we're getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party
but some of I've only talked to one or two and they've all been in dallas but she hasn't talked to anybody in dallas yet
so that's interesting you haven't told me what sports that you are active in
the sport I like best probably is basketball but I guess I'm probably better at softball and so I'd during the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my time
but I play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend but my family usually goes with me we try to do everything we can together I think that's easy entertainment for a family too
they a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we that's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age so they play together pretty well under the stands and under the bleachers
pretty much and tina enjoys the other lady real well
so they that's kind of nice it's like getting together with them
it's getting a little hot isn't it? so to speak it
it's been raining a lot here so far so we haven't really had any kind of real heat I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in the house so it looks like an air conditioner day but it sure does or maybe this evening anyway
it but I'm sure you're familiar with that living here very much so
we go through enid quite a bit we go to tulsa from time to time and my parents live in southern illinois so we drive up there
and lot of times we take seventy five and it seems like that goes through enid it doesn't
I've either seen the signs or enid is it's in the northwest it's directly across the state from tulsa
I know I've seen the sign somewhere sure you have
enid is not an unknown little city it
an awful lot of people know where it is or have been there and it was a very self sufficient wealthy town for a long time anyway until everything happened
the bottom fell out but
it's beginning to do well but there's a lot of old time wealth there that has helped to stabilize things
so how you said you've just lived in north carolina just six months then is something like that
and you really like it there?
I've heard so many people talk about that area I've never been there it's pretty but they sure say it's pretty
the weather is wonderful this winter we it was just we had so many wonderful days and
I if it got to be forty degrees I decided it was too cold to walk the dogs isn't it funny how your standards change?
it really does my wife and I spent a couple years doing church work up in the state of washington right on the coast
and it rains a lot there
but you get used to it it's like a fine mist all the time and it doesn't really it gets to where it doesn't bother you carolina this part is very much like that too very foggy and misty it the moss grows on the trees in the woods up eight ten feet
that's the way it was there too I think however that's like february I know it did it all february and some people said to me that's our wintertime
I know you need to go but and I've enjoyed talking to you
I have enjoyed talking to you too it was nice to talk to you so much have a
I hope you enjoy north carolina thank you and I hope you enjoy and get through that birthday party
I hope I live through it I do too
that's what I hope a lot go ahead
do I still feel that the soviet union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world? absolutely and my reasons are based upon not only what I see on the newspapers but up against some of the fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be but I think just the instability of the country right now is sort of scary
that's what makes it a powder keg the I'll go back in time a little bit to about eighty one when my first real involvement with the military started
naturally we were at the time the soviet union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on soviet tactics and weapons
I went to lebanon in eighty three before the marines ever got there with the u n peace keeping force and with the training I received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against these weren't chinese made copies these were soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box a k forty sevens as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
in granada in october twenty fifth eighty three we invaded the place there were cuban soldiers there but there was also a bunch of russian advisors that were damn good shots the team I was with we jumped in on the western tip of the island down on point salinas and for every cuban there was at least five russian advisors
and they were all shooting state of the art soviet weapons in eighty four I was down in central america as an advisor to the honduran army again we were running up against cubans quite a bit plus soviet advisors and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate soviet made material do I consider them a threat? absolutely they have a university in moscow called the patrice de lamumba university about like a and m or u t where they're teachings subjects like that they're teaching terrorism some of the people we went up against in lebanon were graduates from that place and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
I'm surprised during this iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did these guys are top of the line when they graduate from there they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world and they are very very good at what they do so until I see the entire quote old guard of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear preferably buried I still consider them a threat
their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops that irregardless of what soviet policy is they're going to do what the general tells them I guess that's what concerns me the most is they're so unstable that somebody like that could make decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people
it's interesting watching the different soviet states albania lithuania doing their little revolts down there
each one of those sectors has got a soviet general over the troops that are there so far they haven't run into the real psychos yet there's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these soviet states if uprisings happen in their sectors it's going to be a total blood bath it looks like it's come close to that as it is
they're showing remarkable restraint they get real nasty the hyundee helicopters come out and they would level entire areas you're from the dallas area?
you know basically the size of the area around richardson?
you put five soviet hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive and they can do that in about four minutes
and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by they used them in afghanistan did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in but on a highly populated area like some of the soviet cities would be with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the nerve gas definitely will get you the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time they drink that much fuel
were you have you I take it you haven't spent any time in the military? I haven't
as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in never did make the newspapers
but during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that they're getting all these weapons and stuff? didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff? you mean in the most recent conflict?
in any of them since eighty one definitely I'm a little bit shocked to what the u s has done in terms of selling to iraq in the past ten to fifteen years I think we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too it's bad enough that the soviets do it
it all boils down to whether it's our side their side it's a matter of money to a certain extent
the deal the iraqis have with the russians was for oil it's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons especially when it's to the south of us
the ones to the south are more regional conflict they're not really that worried about invading north they're more interested in they've got a screwed up situation I'll give them that from mexico all the way down into central and south america the situation down there is weird and it's very screwed up inflation is out of this world and the governments which our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out and generally the people are getting screwed
and they're tired of it and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism I think russia is getting to the point where they're about to do something to get out of communism I guess I'd would like to see somebody like yeltsin to get more power I think gorbachev has about had his day
unfortunately yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard that's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing
gorbachev has made his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
yeltsin's in tight with the old guard so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point true I don't know I sure wouldn't turn my back on them
you mean I understand when they reduced the number of troops in europe after the berlin wall went down I thought that was great but by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out
it may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict if united states is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is not only does it talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back up what it's saying if you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground at least they're learning a little bit from history
considering you moved here from california I guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there
we have in california I lived in central california we have rain couple times a year and other than that it would be maybe october and then in the spring and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain especially the last few years
it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it
there has here I know that last year there was some ice storms while I was out of the state and I'm glad to see there haven't been any this year yet
yet still could come generally if we're going to get them it's not going to happen prior to january one
you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in december but usually the bitterest weather if we're going to have any comes in january and february
then by march things are getting warm again so we really don't have as long a cold season as people up north
it's so hard to predict here it's been eighty degrees on christmas day here before lots of times
today it's not bad out there it's nice I just came in from outside
and it's really pretty it's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again
I'm a scoutmaster and so I wind up going out camping with a bunch of boys at one time and so it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go
so you do that even in january? we camp year round
that's interesting but it's definitely different
and then I guess you've been through a couple of summers here too?
I have and they're not too pleasant
it gets so humid to me it's humid here people that I know that come from georgia or north carolina they say it's it is
it's not as humid as houston or atlanta
but more humid than arizona but I find it and california for the most part
were you northern california? I was central california central central valley so that was dry but pretty even climate wasn't it? year round fairly not wide fluctuations it's very dry there
it's pretty hot in the summer it's in the usually for a good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees but it's a drier
but it's a dry heat hundred when you have a hundred here everybody's dying
I know I lived in africa for a couple years in cameroon
and that's a tropical climate and it really feels similar to this during the summer what type of business takes you to those climates or was that just vacation or something?
I still work with wycliff bible translators it's an organization where we are looking to translate the bible into languages of the world that aren't yet written not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages
languages that don't have anything written yet so this is the first thing that's written down or first an alphabet is developed
and then that's interesting
you don't think about that as a normal career when you're thinking of things that people might be doing
it's based here the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in dallas so you're with the home office now
right now I am that's what brought me here I think all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas the weather does change fast
and things do happen severely a few times a year but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between
I agree I agree I thought the fall was really nice and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze
and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time I like that particularly if I'm going to be outdoors and doing outdoor activity hiking and things and that's nicer
you probably do a lot of that with scouting
I do quite a bit of that
think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to east texas and it is a little more humid out there than it is here so I guess we'll
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains
there's not much between us and the north pole
and then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms and then there we are
tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up? when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks and things of that sort and I had two boys
they were both interested in things like model rockets so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets
I have two boys also my children are swimmers and so as they were growing up much of our normal life outside of school and everything revolved around their swimming
so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older I became involved in it too so we were always together at their meets that's good mine were not terribly sporting
they both did t ball and soccer in grade school
but neither one of them carried on the sports after that
the boys tried those but they did go in they started swimming when they were seven and eight and they really loved it and they're swimming both they'll be one is in college also swims in college and the other will continue to swim in college and they're fortunate they even made nationals wonderful that's great
and so we would drive up to see that whenever it was reasonably close but we did a lot of things and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children I
we live near washington so we would always go in for the museums
that's always a big thing and one of my children is also a musician so one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go concerts with him
and my other child is big into tropical fish
so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows so
we didn't have any avid activities like that
they were interested in a lot of things but nothing to quite that depth I guess but we would
I don't think we've missed a fish store on the entire northeast coast of the united states we did go to things like aquariums and natural history museums and zoos and all of those things that one does with kids
in fact it's funny our vacations have always been as they've gotten older when they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a feature each day whether it would be going to
one summer we went up to new england and we went to the marble quarries up there to see that and another day fish hatchery so we did try
and of course we learned too
and I don't know I when they were very young I did not work I started working half time when they were at the nursery school but I yet
and I started working part time when they were in junior high school and high school and I worked in the school system and now I work a full school day but that leaves me off on holidays and summers
so it was a I think they need me more when they were older than they did when they were
I think they need you in different ways
that's true you want to be around for the crisis and things like that but it's not quite so much the hand holding and peanut butter and jelly making that's right
that's for sure that's for sure do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see? it the one trend is that with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons
and I don't think it needs to be the mothers but I think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours
when they it was funny I can remember and my mother and I have talked about it to how important it was when I came home from school
it wasn't really conversation but there were always things that just tumbled out
granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it but it when it's not there they miss it I think that's true but I also think that's at least in my experience truer of girls than boys
even when I was there my boys didn't share all that much with me and certainly not to the extent I did with my mother
I realize that but it's funny they don't always do it but occasionally they do and you want
and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it
and at least I've wanted to be available when for some reason they were bouncing something off of me because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about
and it was you just felt if I weren't here how
or if my husband who would they ask? that's right or what would they do?
that's exactly right but it's been interesting particularly because the society in which we live families are separated you don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles
I grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives I did too we were close to my maternal grandparents and close enough to visit my paternal grandparents quite often
they were fifty miles away but
and we're that I grew up with every weekend there was some visiting somewhere
and it was sort of an italian family
but my children although we have some relatives in the area that we see we they don't it's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins
when my kids were quite small we lived close to both sets of grandparents
and they saw them a lot but they don't have any cousins or they didn't
their cousins are about ten years younger
so they never played together or anything
and I just sort of think yeah and there are only two of them and they didn't live in the same town
that the trend of families and time where parents are spending less time you don't have the families to take up the gap that's right
and so the kids in some ways are suffering a little bit in that the family issues that get discussed and all these are very important parts of them growing up
so we try to do it as well as we can we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone
and cousins and aunts and uncles and we do but although it's not the same we are and that's part of teaching too is what a family is like because then how do they pattern their own? everyone makes its own model but it seems that there should be some continuity
and it's helpful to have things that become family traditions and that sort of thing
that's we have had this tradition that we always go out before christmas and cut our own tree
and that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had this year it's was hard with our son now being in college
so this was one thing that we weren't able to do this year but we did that from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until our older son went away to college that's the kind of thing that they will remember though
and we have advent calendars still from the time that they came to ours finally disintegrated
we had a felt one that was it was a christmas tree that had a little trinket for each day that was pinned on the date
that's and then you took it off and put it on the tree so at the end you had a decorated tree
ours is a friend of mine from denmark hand appliqued one for each child and it finally got moth eaten we threw it way last year how nice
and they look today as new as they did when she gave them to us and there's a ring and you buy a present I see
and you wrap the present up and the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of band aids and an eraser and things how cute
to today where sometimes I put a little gift if I see something that's occasionally a christmas tree decoration which they will save for their future to sometimes just money pieces of candy
so I think as they're getting in college I just for my older boy that was in college I put a dollar bill for each day which was the equivalent I'm sure he appreciated that
it was the equivalent of a christmas present
and it was fun but that's a tradition and those will be passed on to them when they get married and leave
you were saying what other trends are there and one just occurred to me because I was editing a book about it recently
and that is the trend in a lot of lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children
and that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs
the and the broken families as I said living in an area of washington d c we definitely see this
and it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising children from the streets too frequently we had a sociologist at the center where I work who was writing a book on multigeneration matriarchies where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother and
this is a this is in fact we've been studying this in our school that not the symptoms it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing it's a rite of passage
what do you think about the idea of kids having to do public service work for a year? do you think it's a
I think it's a pretty good idea I think they should either do that or afford some time to the military or helping elderly people
I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea that's true
or the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad for
I think it teaches kids how to grow how about yourself? I agree with you what I'm thinking about is back when I was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of the parents kind of pushed them to join the boy scouts or girl scouts and they did do a lot of public service activities but these days they're not parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that because when I was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that's just part of the scouting and
I've that's really great I really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is two excellent organizations they are but parents
kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that they do
and they don't follow it at all there are very few scouts go on and become eagle scouts
and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals but I senior
senior so there's not they're just not once they get into junior high it just not done anymore they lose interest
and then when they young adults there's even less interest there they're more for me
not grab grab grab walk out
you're absolutely right
I think it's really a good thing I like to see of course there's third world countries that can use all kind of help but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country too but I think we ought to start right here at home
I'm I'm not so sure that helping overseas would be such a hot idea for a lot of young people
it but since there is much that needs to be done here
I think that we need to really address what we've done here and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook
it's been really good we talked about this for a few minutes and hopefully we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday but I don't really have too much more to say on this topic I guess I agree with you
I guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do sometime
you take care and enjoy the day you too you too thank you ma'am
who's your favorite team? who do you think? the dallas cowboys the dallas cowgirls
they did have a fairly decent year finally this year
at least they're coming around they're going to get better
I think once jimmy johnson gets his system established they'll do all right as long as troy aikman doesn't get hurt again that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year
I don't even know who your favorite team is actually
I'm a viking fan I think I did know that I just forgot
and they haven't been doing too hot so has herschel walker done much for them?
in fact the cowboys got the best end of that deal he was a good player I guess I don't know he just never I don't know for a while there
I've never been over impressed with him he'd get past six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone but I guess you never could really see him play because with the cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team but I don't know
who's the running is it sammy smith or is it emmett smith emmett smith emmett smith he's been doing real good I'm pretty impressed with him so far
did he actually play in the pro bowl I remember he was a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go
I'm not sure I haven't been keeping up with football in the fall I can go on and on about football but since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that but
who else is there's mike minnesota vikings used to be the general manager starting the world football league
and he was trying to keep I can't even think of the guy's name either the coach of the vikings I have no idea jerry burns no earthly idea
he was going to keep him as the coach somehow but I don't know I'd like to see the vikings get revamped somehow how did they end up this year? did they make it to the play offs at all?
they started out really bad they went one and six and then they won five or six in a row
so they were in a shot to make the play offs and they screwed up the last couple of games kind of like the cowboys
I guess you can except I think the cowboys are on the upswing I don't know about the vikings
just hadn't heard much about them lately
and the cardinals were kind of like the in fact they were doing better than the cowboys and the cowboys came on strong at the end of the season and the cardinals got killed by the cowboys so the cardinals I don't know I think the cowboys probably have a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt because laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
don't made any excuses for him I'm just saying I shouldn't blast him like that say laufenberg got out there and blew it for them he didn't get to see much action but too bad because he had a shot and didn't look too good and so no one's going to have much faith in him any more
in fact I think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback I haven't kept up with it lately but I remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody I'd really heard of but I heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that aikman's back in practicing doing real real well who is it michael irvin
he said that aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time so sounds like he's going to be all right for next season they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder back in it was his shoulder that he had the problems with?
I don't know I think it was I think it was his shoulder he had surgery on but they're trying to keep him from reinjuring anything but
but I got my thirty day notice yesterday thirty day notice for what?
I'm done where I work
I guess we can't talk much more about that but I just thought I'd throw that in there what maybe I'll call you back after the recording is finished actually I think we have talked about football for five minutes I can't remember
I've always ran out of time ever since I've done this I usually have too
they always say you've talked your ten minute limit I've done that once or twice I didn't look at the clock when we started talking so I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in
make sure we get our cash flow
other than the vikings who do you like?
actually when I was younger I was a cardinal fan too
remember jim hart? jim hart was playing terry metcalf was on the cardinals this was a long time ago
I don't know who else I've ever that's about it I was always a viking fan I think I was into the cardinals for a little bit and back when they were in saint louis?
of course since they've been to phoenix they haven't been all that impressive I guess I guess I've always been a cowboy fan other than that when you grow up in a city that has one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to get caught up in it
the cowboys were america's football team
there's no question about that so it was really exciting growing up when the cowboys were really big
because my parents would always have season tickets and they'd go to all the games and the hype were just unbelievable it's just the last I guess probably since about eighty four about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but I'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys cowboys cowboys and super bowl and all this other stuff so I can't I'm not going to decide I don't like them just because they're having a few bad years I think they'll pull out of it and they'll wind up being good again they've got lot of really good young players that are going to do pretty good I think but they're raising prices on their tickets so they're banking on doing good next season I think tickets are again
what are they going up to thirty bucks or something? thirty or thirty two for really good tickets they sectioned it out even more they used to just have first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else and now they're sectioning it off from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the direct end zones but they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously they're all going up more or less is what it's going to do
so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year I'm not sure I'm not positive I didn't really think about that I just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper but not that I'll ever go I hadn't been to a cowboys game last time I went to the cowboys game was during that n f l strike or when they had the scab teams in there and it was the dallas and washington redskins game and I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else so I went with my dad to a game that one time but that wasn't a real it was the scab teams it was kind of different I guess and before that it's been quite a few years I've been wanting to go to a game I just never have gotten around to it so maybe this year
that's interesting I almost lost our electricity here
universal health insurance
that's right I think universal health insurance like national health like what canada has is that what you're thinking the subject is about? what would we like to say I think
I think that's what the subject is about did you read the article in the paper today about this particular subject?
in the morning times?
I guess I did not the state of washington and the state of minnesota is going to begin testing a state funded program for citizens of those two states and there's fourteen other states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning I think it's a trend that's probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need it's getting to a point that you have to have it you have to have some form of health insurance
it's been interesting that we extremely expensive though
we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
and yet I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it that's the thing unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are paying for the people that don't have health insurance
which is why people are talking about we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair I don't think you
you have health insurance? I do
through your company? through my company but I have been in a situation recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year and my wife developed cancer we didn't have any insurance
and it was a go to parkland type situation that's must have been hard
how was your care at parkland? because it was a life threatening situation it was very good as it turned out one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at parkland
but yet parkland is not free either it's not free but it's a situation that because I didn't have any insurance and I was on unemployment it was paid by the county is it affordable?
so you did have a good experience I had a bad experience as it turned out I was fortunate that there was parkland
is your wife better I hope? she passed away I'm real sorry that's all right that happens
it does happen but it's very sad but in any event I'm in favor of national health if I had to vote for it so am I
actually I'm a pediatrician is that right?
and I feel very strongly about children and developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most
so I'm really quite active in trying to be proactive at least for children's issues it's very complex very complicated but I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits when I grew up and I grew up in south central kansas we had and my mom worked for the county health department and we had x rays every year we had a dentist come to our school and check our teeth once a year at least we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff
and when my children were growing up we didn't have that we had to pay for it which I wasn't opposed to paying for it I had the money to pay for it but I'm sure that there were people that don't
and so much has gone up so much the cost of immunizations for example and just the legal benefits that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera
I don't know it is interesting in case you didn't know texas leads the nation in uninsured children thirty one percent of all texas children do not have insurance and are not on medicaid did not know that
so one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care and I work in the children's parkland system and it's pretty overwhelming to me
but it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county
the question was on lawn and garden work how do you like it?
I don't do much of it here I'm from colorado originally and there are no bugs there and I didn't mind getting in the dirt there but I'll tell you what once I see these bugs around here I'm just kind of out of it what kind do you have?
roaches and do they really?
cockroaches are awful here
just awful so I and I know somebody that lives there and they never mentioned that problem
you're kidding you're kidding it's a maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here and they probably just take it for granted then
it must be if they lived here a lot of people I know just say I just stomp on them it doesn't matter they make good fertilizer in the garden
me personally can't I don't have that problem it's mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that I said I'll do inside work you do outside work
and so I get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that
but I don't like it dirty
I have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really I don't know we got the question and I thought this is going to be interesting two bits I'll get a man to talk to me because they get stuck doing it all
but although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall
today we just had a lot of rain
so it's kind of nice I don't know how yours has been
it's been real hot here lately we've had to actually have the air conditioning on and everything but it's supposed to rain again this weekend I see
so then we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to new orleans and from ohio since we're right near lake erie this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there
and I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity but as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know too much about how much I really do enjoy it myself
do you like it at all?
not here it's just here I just can't stand to even get out in the dirt just how about when you were in colorado?
I liked it a little bit but I didn't I was working at that time full time and didn't have a lot of time for that
and so that really hampered it a little bit and then too where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was high and if you have that on a regular basis in texas I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off
and with children you probably don't have time anyhow to get into it
not really it's so very good
I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we? sounds like
afraid not hopefully they'll give a subject I like one of these times something I really know a lot about nice talking to you nice talking with you
one year public service for everybody that was it?
who wants to start this one? I don't know I've been sitting here thinking because it took a couple tries before I found somebody I'm not really sure what I think about this the first thing is if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory everybody not just poor people and all that but senators sons and all that stuff too
everybody's got to do it I don't know it'd probably be good I just don't know if I was eighteen or whatever I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever
I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision that doesn't sound right I guess I see overall beneficial if we're going from that point of view
in the past I don't know I don't know how old you are but when I was in high school it was the beginning of vietnam and so forth and many of my peers were being drafted
and I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever but I felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways be it cleaning out lots in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available
and I guess I see that as not so much a demand but a privilege it's something it is
it's since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest I just see that as maybe a good idea I wouldn't mind doing it at forty four
and I find ways to turn some of that back to others and I guess I can't see that as being something to really object to I guess it would still depend on how if you're talking about something that's like one year full time this is what you do you're going to go and fill pot holes and all that stuff I don't know
I could see a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that could be done in an hour or two a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on saturday or something like that in addition to what one does besides that
I can't imagine what kind of bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time you're going to go to this camp and you're going to back in the depression the c c c the construction corps that went out and did things that was great
it was needed it gave some folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but I don't see that as being necessary now I can see it being done on a regular schedule
everybody has to put in so many hours of public service in a given time perhaps
I guess I see all of us benefiting and I don't see it just relegated to the young but I see so much going on that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem
something that they turn back
and also you feel more like you're actually part of the community if you've done something in it that's right
you take pride in that and get some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself
and I see it being most beneficial if it's in at least the area where the person lives definitely
it might not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then you're coming in contact with it it's not as meaningful for me to go to minnesota and do something up there that I'll never be able to see again unless I happen to go on vacation up there
it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going
but as far as putting that into work I don't want to deal with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics of it that would be a nightmare
and just getting it going
I see a lot of things like scouting boys clubs girls clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship the looking after the environment sort of thing
and I guess I don't see this being that different but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in
do you have kids? not yet in about six months we will
good you'll have a little time think about that I guess I have when I was teaching school I saw so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose and I can see some really significant things coming out of it
I know you've got to get past that grudge attitude that many have but that would be a part of selling it to the community
the adults ahead of it would probably never serve and to each succeeding generation there definitely would have to be a major p r campaign in each community each county parish or however the state was divided up
I may I don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will police a couple of miles of the highway and and I've seen it in other states too they have that here I don't know
they've got in most of the states around here down in north carolina there was a big controversy for a while because the local chapter of the k k k wanted to participate in it and there was a
and there were those that said you can't do that I'm sure it was interesting because that's an interesting question
should these people be allowed to or not? I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed
and I hadn't even thought about the other end of that that's an interesting situation I hadn't thought of that we had visited relatives in virginia not too long ago and I thought I had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and I think virginia's got it and I know maryland does and we went to indianapolis last weekend and back and I'm pretty sure I saw stuff in ohio and indiana about it and maybe pennsylvania I don't remember for sure now
and I don't know about your part of the country but down here in the last year plus there's just been more of a turn toward environmental concerns
and I work for texas instruments
and they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said it's not feasible
it's not a good idea and I see that as being a change for the positive kind of along the same line as the mandatory thing but then they lost too much business
it's just thing a part of everyone's consciousness the thing about that is though it's got a because it was big in the early seventies and all that and then it kind of just went out of vogue and I'm worried that the same thing will happen it's like environmentalism was really big for a couple of years and then people I'd rather spend fifty cents less on such and such and even if it's not environmentally safe who cares
I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life and if you look at history at all you see that we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that one might care to bring up
but it is comforting to me to see more concern about some of these things that cost us money especially when we have dwindling resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the persian gulf and so forth just every little bit does it makes me feel better it makes me feel like there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth wouldn't it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may make some people realize that this stuff runs out
that's right because of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say coming from where you are in texas
because if we what was it when we had the last oil crisis? and we started getting smart and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth
and as soon as the oil prices came back down the pendulum swang the other way
and we need those reminders
or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology my dad's in the solar energy business so we're acutely aware of a lot of this
but on the other hand he voted for george bush so I wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing
I just about anybody you could name whether I voted for them or not makes decisions that I just can't go along with
but that's why they're there and not me I don't want the stress the thing with bush
are you presently looking for a used car?
as a matter of fact I just bought one just bought one
just within the last three weeks what did you get?
I got a lexus l s four hundred which is made by toyota lexus
lexus is a toyota subbrand it's kind of their I was wondering where that came from because they're talking like it was an american built car
it sounds like it but it really isn't
it's marketed of course it its own dealerships
usually or somebody that's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership
sometimes they do that but it's a brand car
but I've really liked it it drives just wonderfully and there is it's so quiet almost can't tell the engine is running that's their big selling point other than general luxury but the particular seems to be the quiet ride
it really is it's got pretty good acceleration too
it's got a c d player in it so I can play those and was that wasn't a standard feature was it?
but there is not very many options on that car
there is only about five or six options everything else is standard you get the impression that
some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north the c d and the premium sound system skidding control you mean the antilock brake system?
it's kind of a traction control
it's not just antilock brake I think that's already on most of them but there is a further traction control this is probably suspension tied into the brakes
and also the suspension can be raised for driving in the ice and snow it can raise the car's center up a little bit for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in michigan or somewhere
mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much some of these muddy driveways could use it around here
snow doesn't happen very often
if it does people go what's this stuff originally I'm from west virginia we got a pretty fair amount of snow you had some there
but I got down here in june of eighty four and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children
I know we had this group of surveyors come into a shop I was working in four or five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked but while they were there they set back drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place had themselves a ball for about an hour
the lexus really and the moon roof is also an option
although most of them are ordered them with it but there really is only about a half a dozen things and everything else is pretty standard
I did not get the traction control which when you take the traction control and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too so that's kind of you go out and get in that real cold car it's a package deal
and you turn that on and it kind of but that's only available with the traction control and the other option
and those two are sold together so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to do it
so I opted not for that but and the dealership I dealt with they order them all with the moon roof and nice floor mats and everything in there it doesn't sound real necessary in texas
I worked for lincoln
so the only thing I had to decide on was whether I wanted a c d or not in the stereo system and that was pretty much it and they had like three or four basic packages that they offer sounds like the lincoln mercury dealer I used to work for they didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got little mercury tracer
I've been I've been imagine or not they make a luxury mercury tracer
I've seen that in the dealership I was driving a lincoln a mark seven for the last four years before I traded it for this
and I'm leasing the lexus I usually lease them since I own a business
I just run it through my business but it
the lincoln ride is certainly good too but this lexus is nothing like I have ever been in before it's just like sitting in your living room
it really is and it's got a lumbar support in the seats adjustable? adjustable power and just kind of brings that support up in the
I guess I've always been kind of interested in space and stuff I've read a lot of the astronomy books and stuff like that
have you been following the progress of the space health code? to a degree I haven't kept up as much as I would like
I've just been so busy
I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then so
I think it's pretty exciting that they can it would be interesting to see if they can find other planets that will be more habitable to humans and I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if it is at all possible I wouldn't even mind being a pilot on one or right now but I'm probably getting a little too old for that
I know if they make the advances that they have been making that maybe age or even physical abilities may not be a barrier anymore they just made leaps and jumps I think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel equipment and stuff that
I agree as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to houston to visit the space center out there and one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro
and that vacuum little space program was one of the big backers of that
it's amazing you it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now
I don't know if you ever watch gallagher he's one of the comedians and he talks a lot on velcro
I've seen him before what would we do without it?
we were talking about that just the other day what did we do without it back then?
I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps
there's a lot of little things that have come up I know maybe some of the big things that concentrated foods for one maybe I don't know
that's right that's right it's also just I've often pictured in my mind what would you find if you just kept on going?
that's true I guess our minds are so finite
when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object and it's hard to see
I always thought what do you do hit a brick wall eventually it's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely
that is something that would be hard to think about I agree like you say we're used to finite things and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible but
but I would like to see them do more in that area to make space travel more something that the ordinary person can enjoy I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something
and I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some
me too I wouldn't even mind not so much being first but just get out there and just explore
I think it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't or experience something indifferent
I think that's what made us progress to the state we are is our curiosity
of course that's true there must be some better way of doing this a better place to be or whatever it's
so you are always looking for something better
that's true I know at work people always complain to me you are always whining and it's I'm always looking for something better
there's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it
that's right that's right and if you are just content with the way things are then you must lead a pretty dull life
because if they are always finding easier ways and just because they don't talk about it or something like that
and they are doing it unconsciously
I guess you don't really think about it too much I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff but it's a subconscious thing somewhere they can sit down and write down what things that you've improved upon you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list
but you just don't think about them
and that's true I think we've gotten different programs at work to make it visible to management that we are doing things better
go ahead what kind of books do you like to read?
I like all kinds of books
mostly I like true life documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life
and I also like romantic novels I like readers digest believe it or not so do I
I usually read that from cover to cover
I like it because there's a little bit of everything in it
that kind of a thing as far as real novels I haven't gotten into shakespeare or any of that type of thing
I wish I had in some senses but I don't have time really as much as I would like to get into that kind of thing how about you? I like like you said real life I like biographies of people's lives especially athletes
for some reason it seems to interest me people that make a big comeback or orel hershiser things like that
and I like to read books on improve like family marriage things that are written by christian authors or doctors about family and how to improve your home and all that kind of thing I like to the magazines I to I like to read I read a lot of bicycling magazines they're I mainly look at the pictures and stuff but they usually have some good articles in it
but I don't know I haven't really found any romance type stuff I like to read I'm more nonfiction
I haven't found a lot of fiction books that I really like but not to say I wouldn't
eventually what was the last book you read?
let me think it I tell you I haven't read a book in a long time and it I can't even really remember I think it was a romantic novel by danielle steel or one of those
honestly I don't do as much reading like I say as I would like to
working a lot of hours at work and
and then of course we have a home I know
so it's a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or that type of thing
I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is about eleven more books than I would have read last year but so far I've only read two books and so I'm not doing very well but but I do crafts too
so it's hard if I have a minute that's what I do I find it's real hard I let newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them
that's the and that's like myself I miss it because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too
I really do and I don't know it seems like you can get lost in a book it's like an escape for me
I don't know about you
it's if I'm really interested in what I'm reading hours can go by and I look up at the clock and say
in fact I'd rather read sometimes than watch t v I would too kind of train your mind
but I think you get out of the habit like you say you have to kind of set yourself
have you ever read or heard of the book this present darkness?
that was one of the books I read this year and it's really fast paced and intense it is a fiction book but it was it was one of the best I read it was real good and it was one of the few books that it just hurry up and go through without putting down
that's the other problem I have if I start into something and I really enjoy what I'm reading then I have a terrible time getting away from it too
I'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning because I'm so engrossed in it and then before you know it it's time to get up and go to work that type of thing
that's why I don't know I'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that even if I'm doing something like an afghan if I'm close to the end sometimes I'll do the same thing
I don't know what you would call it maybe I have a problem I'm sure it's fast or something
it's terrible I really like books that you can get into and that's that I know what you mean I like reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes I just sleep better or something
you do you kind of get relaxed that's true but
I have a lot of craft books that I have too and magazines I like people those things that are about real people
and I like to read about people who made a success of their lives
what book have you read that is along those lines that was really good?
to give you specific titles I can't how about who
like I say haven't done it in such a long time do you know who it was about?
I went to uh seminar on it was by american business and some of the people what the heck was his name I'm trying to think he's one of the paroe and it was more like it was tapes and things that they had about him too
how he started out as just a salesman and now he's multimillionaire and that type of thing and how you have to be aggressive and really want something for yourself and that type of stuff it's up to you whatever happens in your life
it's not up it's not someone else you have to do it
and I find that fascinating that people can do that kind of thing just make up their minds that that's it have this one direction and then do it do it I can't I'm not that focused on something
I'm off in all directions
and I'm not a planner which I wish I was
kind of off the wall if someone says do you want to do this tonight and I got a mountain of things to do it's okay we do it that's all right
I know I know but I wish I was more the other way you're more fun though you're not ridged?
I that's I like it that way though I don't want to change that part of me that's good
that's funny even though I admire someone who isn't like I am and I wish I could be more that way but there may be some schools you could read about and learn
that's true that's true how many people do you supervise? about twenty that's not bad
that's not bad at all do you like your job? sometimes
sometimes more than others but I do
that's important I've been there about three years
do you have a family? I just got married last year and most of my family's in indiana
so I've only been in texas three years
do you like it? I do I love the weather down here
I loved abilene too that's what I liked too is the weather I know
except for tornados they have storms here I've
they do and it's so surprising how it just happens hail and thunder and unpredictable were you here during the hailstorm two years ago?
I've been up here about three we were down there from eighty five to eighty six part of eighty four to eighty six I should say I had thirty three hundred dollars damage done on my car a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail
I think state farm went bankrupt just about but
I know the whole situation is bad up here we're having a terrible time with the recession
it's not good at all
I know things are pretty booming down there I heard they sold johnson city though and colorado springs
and colorado springs? I talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day and he was telling me about it they just sold it amazing closed up and moved down to mckinney
that's good at least they kept the business part of it it's scary though I'm telling you I know
I don't know and the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family how do I feel what?
that books influence do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
I feel like it's important for young children to read too and what you read to them
when my children were younger of course they were all married and grown and I have grandchildren now they were I read to them a lot that's good
and I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also that's
I'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all and I think it's important
because even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens they don't learn anything it's because they can't read it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school that I work with
and people I get memos all the time across my desk and things are misspelled and it's pretty sad it's unbelievable isn't it?
a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read
exactly and I think that that's why reading is so important
because I think even mentally when you can do some
the first thing for me is I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is if an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it finds something out about you that's another and the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me and very much everyday in this country but in the second time at least overtly where someone comes in and finds out information about you that should be private does not seem obviously everyday
I think I agree with that I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens when the phone rang and it's t I calling my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message and then I realize this is something I solicited that's right
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that I realized I really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
it turned out to be an invitation
and at the same time I think that I receive on the order of probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it from personal parties or from these phone commercial things commercial solicitations primarily
that's a remarkable number I get them rarely and I'm still astounded that one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effect in this whatsoever because I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what they are
I think they prey on people's inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there
and I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and one's feeling obligated because of some sense of the way the ritual is played out
and that then ends up being the most common example for me
I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised
and I don't think I would have thought about that I think that's a good idea on your part I don't typically feel intruded on on the sense of finding out information presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it I would prefer not to be known and the classic c I a conspiracy theories or whatever would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge so there's things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia it's a surmise and I'd like to think that it's quite low at least in this country
to surmise it is there I don't think the k g b is monitoring my phone or anything like that
I guess although that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest
and I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
if you're defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it then I guess one could assume one was invaded
but I don't feel invaded by it
I don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things
I'm not sure why I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true I don't have a sense of loss from that you must have a relatively clean conscience then
the other side of that might be if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense more harmed or something
because you don't have anyway to turn it off
did you hear about this lotus data base that was being put together? I did I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be a good possibly that their facts were fantasy
and then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information that I would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of the spending pattern for instance that I would have thought to be private
but then if it turns out to generate incorrect things that's even worse or if my call rate of eight or so a week went up even higher because someone had they had you pegged
and the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now they're advertising you
and one of the problems with the lotus data base was that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information they said they would give it out to only select companies just like software is only given out to customers you can't believe that
it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering full cash price for it
you can't tell it what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and that hacker just has to get in touch with the sneak thief and suddenly what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home
and I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of it
so maybe that is a little bit of what privacy is
I also thought about it waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't but I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if I deviate from social norms of behavior if I run up and down the street yelling or something someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly
and I realize that I can take that for granted but I used to live in india and things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no indian language has a word for privacy certainly the language I know doesn't but just says a word for loneliness
that's interesting loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
but no concept for wanting to be private it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially
so there's not doors don't have latches on them people don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way people walk in out and as a westerner in india I was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded
that would be culturally shocking
it very much is but on the other hand I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
and people would leave me alone
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and then act like the lunatic you violate the norms of public behavior people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in the sense are invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are quote unquote you asked for it but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
which isn't always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
that is true I haven't thought about that and that it's fascinating to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private and that's really I wonder how people have sex and things like that
they you go to india and the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years but I just don't quite there's hope I actually for of the time I've spent there I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy
because anyone can be alone for some period of time but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect
and if that's gone I really don't know how to live very well and I really do wonder how people do that
that's interesting are there any other specific things where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day to day basis or either on a growing frequency? all the other classic examples the jehovah's witness or mormons or someone knocking at the front door which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away and there's that sense of I have now opened my door they now see what I look like what I live like and they're doing something that normally I really only invite people to
because any friend anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my house so that is more of a sense of invasion so that's another example of the invasion because of the not so I'm ready
so we're going to talk about what kind of clothes we wear while we work
do you work for t I? I work at home
you do you're like me then I stay home also do you have children?
I have two a seven year old and three and a half year old that's good how about you? I have four girls
they're nine and five and three and a newborn you are busy and they're all girls I have two girls so all girls around here girls are nice aren't they?
really sweet as far as clothing goes my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size that's how I am too we go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet or you're on your way up from regular size
that's funny and they're all in boxes or bags and they all rotate all the time kind of the same stuff all the time though
I don't get a whole lot new right now
I know that's kind of how I am I said who ever I talk to is going to be board because when it's summer time I'm wearing shorts and when it's cold I'm wearing sweat pants unless I'm going to something special that my daughter's doing or something like that I like jeans a lot
that's good I used to wear jeans all the time until after I had kids and now nothing seems to be comfortable because I bulge in all the wrong places so and it's frustrating I find I have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable
they it works best if they have pleats in the front
and they have to my waist is kind of small compared to the hips so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind
I know what you mean but I I was pregnant through the summer this time and I wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist that's right but
one of my daughters was born in june and I remember I wore sundresses and just those real cool dresses almost the entire time
and I had one that was born in december so it was a little bit because it was a real warm winter
so even into november and december I was still wearing the short sleeve dresses course I'm always hot when I'm pregnant too so
I didn't really need warm clothes but I really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new units outfits that are just knit I haven't tried those
they are so comfortable
it's just a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff
and it's just great because you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want
or you can just wear them with tennis shoes if you want so they're really nice and I've enjoyed wearing those but I I don't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here but I sure never wear them
I don't either if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference
I worked part time when my oldest was a baby
and I had to wear a dress every day and it was a little bit hard to wind down I'm watching janice
I would have to drive six thirty five home and I would be burning up in the summer time
by the time I got home I was I've got to get out of these clothes I remember that from when I was I worked way before I was married even but offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable
you've got to have something to add to it or something
I don't know if you can
and then when you drive home especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in dallas you burn up
because I always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time I was afraid I'd make the car overheat it's hard on the car
so I would roll my windows down it was still a hundred degrees
and I would just be sweltering hot by the time I picked my daughter up and I had a friend who used to take shorts to work
and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes that's funny
and I thought that's probably a good idea because you really at least something cooler
because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which I don't have any of that's true
I don't have to worry a whole lot about that
when you have children you don't even when I go to church I have to have something I can just throw in the washer when I'm through that's right something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on too that's right or if you get it dirty or whatever I know it I've always been a creature of comfort too me too if it's not comfortable forget it I know that's how I am too wool was never comfortable to me me neither I have you ready?
is that it? that's it
I guess we have to talk about magazines and what what kind do you subscribe to or do you?
I did subscribe to people for a long time I do I enjoy people and now I subscribe to ladies home journal I take a computer magazine and also better homes and gardens
are you interested in computers? and my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside and the cardboard pages
that would be one of my peeves my pet peeves with magazines the woman's magazines especially it's really geared to all they have you have too many recipes first of all I just don't that's what I don't like about ladies home journal magazines too many recipes too many can this marriage with saved nonsense I like to read articles about things that matter of course people magazine is not one of your more intellectual magazines
but it's nice light reading if I want something intellectual I usually read a book that's true I like it when they have short stories redbook used to always have a good short story in it
that's true they did and I haven't bought a redbook in a while so I guess
I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore
is redbook still in existence? I don't know if they're around anymore I think it is surely it's an institution surely it would have to be but
I'll tell you the only reason I subscribe to the journal is because of which I think it was either it was publisher's clearinghouse
they told me if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their list so mine too this was it my last chance
my last chance to win ten million dollars so I figured look for twelve dollars I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that to entertainment that's it
and I was real disappointed with it
I don't know it just not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into
it's little short articles more than anything else
and that's one thing I don't like about people it doesn't seem to have enough story to it
I don't know I just think it's light reading if you've only got a short time to read
you don't have to concentrate that's true
it's entertaining and that's I enjoy it I that entertainment is very isn't it similar to the tv guide? not really not the one I take now it's a magazine and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes
I see and I'm a real movie buff so that's why I thought I might be interested in it but it just hasn't been what I thought it would be
and the reason I get the home journal and the computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me
otherwise if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf I'll pick it up then rather than having them delivered and think I really need to read this
I'll tell you since I've been getting the journal maybe I'll read two maybe three if I read three articles in one of the journals I figure I did really well
because there's just nothing in there that interests me I'm not into recipes and I do like recipes and crafts
and I'm not into crafts so that eliminates three quarters of the magazine that's true
I just got the new issue they have bette midler on the cover so that should be one article that I'll read anyway do you
what are your favorite shows? I like watching colombo and matlock and quantum leap quantum leap?
did you see it the other night?
that was pretty good that one was what about
what do you with the psychic and everything?
I like northern exposure and home improvement I haven't seen either of those
you've never seen northern exposure?
it's a great show I also like to watch star trek but it's on so late here that I don't always get to see it
we like it too have you seen the movie? I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely just in the last year or so got interested in it and they're already out with number six by now so I haven't seen any of the movies yet but I
you haven't seen any of them
they're good they're real good they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though
which ones are you watching the new ones? I've seen quite a few of the older ones I haven't seen really the new generation that much
is there one you prefer better the older one or the newer one?
they're a lot different but I like the older ones because at that time they were really futuristic
and I guess the newer ones are real futuristic too but I like both of them I do too I have a brother in law who really likes the old ones a lot he almost hates the new ones
because he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but I don't
not really it's not really like a soap opera I think
but it's but that's true you learn more about the characters and stuff but that's the way all shows are now let's see I like to watch colombo because it's like a mystery thing
that's sort of how matlock is but colombo is way tricky
he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them
it seems like they always show colombo the same ones over and over though like that one where he goes to college did you see the one
or is there a series on there's one on we see it thursdays at seven and it was
this last time it was about this movie director did you
I saw that one did you see that?
that was a rerun I guess I
I wondered if that's
I don't know if that's the movie of the week or what but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones and then they keep showing them over and over I guess I haven't seen it before
he was a movie director and he had that gal killed
on the set or something
that was pretty good though it was but I like colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things
but there's never anything good on saturdays though
no kidding I don't think so star trek's on at five but I'm never home so
what is it that there's something I watch on saturdays and I can't remember what it is I used to watch twin peaks
you never saw that? I've heard of it a lot I've heard of a lot of people somehow or something they'll say so and so from twin peaks or something
that was a different soap opera
but it was a different type of show
I didn't like the way it ended though did they end the whole series?
they only did it for two years
but it's all over now another show I like to watch is mash
in a normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first?
I have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so I'm really just starting to get involved in what's out there and how they do things as far as the system as a whole I really don't see a problem with it I do see a problem with graduating people that can't read and are not productive in society or productive to themselves and I think that's the main problem at this point how about yourself? I live in plano texas and today we're not even suppose to be in school because the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in texas today
when you take professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to get that major subject in line something's wrong so I think here in texas mainly that they're not serious they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for how the level of education should be for children I have a one year old so I'm more opinionated about the observations than the true facts but it's just a shame to me that our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities that have the biggest impact to our well being
that's true I have a real issue with that I think that if from every year when they pull in the test that the last three years ten eleven twelve graders take and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states they're not saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in texas I have a real concern about that as a matter of fact I'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in virginia verses having her go down here and not learn anything
so I think there's a big concern hopefully the new secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but I don't know they've got to quit worrying about the religious overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product
I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that special interest groups can blow up and not really get down to teaching what's important
teaching these kids really the basics is what it comes down to I was astonished to find out that across the united states in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed
is that right? the kids nowadays don't even know what the president's fitness education program is all about
they don't have to do sit ups and push ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school
I remember and and I talked to a thirteen year old last night who goes to one of the plano high schools or junior highs and she said that she had a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she choice to take weight lifting over the regular gym
give me a break the kids sit there and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for lunch and then go out there and lift weights and don't learn anything
and talk I have a real problem with the whole system
they need to put some sternness back into the teachers and let them be able to get the old whip out and get some discipline
then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public service employees that there are
I used to date a girl who taught english at ninth grade level and yet they're so important
I was absolutely flabbergasted at what she was paid she was young but still it's the principle
of course if she got her master's degree it would all be different but
it's hard though because then you start talking taxes and that's a bad word taxes lord forbid taxes
if we would plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem
there's an idea maybe I should run for office?
run on that then no income taxes in texas? that's true
I'm in texas too so that's funny that's funny that's about all I have here
me too I think we both agree there's some problems there but we'll maybe do our small part to fix them up ma'am I've enjoyed it you too
I guess social change takes in a big category but I guess the one aspect of it that I took in consideration is more economical
I know that or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has greatly changed
I agree I know they did a it was on a talk show they took the parents and then the son and they compared income at different points in time when the father was a little bit younger and more in his heyday
and they compared to the son's that he was making now and even though the son was probably more successful higher up in the management ladder he was actually making less money when you go by costs of living
and it's depending on where you live though too I know just with me ten years ago I was comparing the I think I was living better ten years ago than I am now even though I'm making more money now but my dollar went a lot farther
that's true ten years ago I was eleven I remember though buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now and gas
and I used to hear stories from my grandpa and he could see a movie for a nickel and things like that I know gas prices have definitely jumped from I know I used to pay twenty five cents a gallon and now it's over a buck
I don't know what it's by you around here minnesota wisconsin area it's dropping but I think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average
I'm from wisconsin that's most of the people I talk to are texas so
I spoke to a person from texas too
this is only my second phone call so I'm waiting for mine
I suppose this will be towards my last one pretty soon so they'll stop me
but I'm pretty much out to the things to say like social changes
and I don't think this would have anything to do with it but clothing and styles lot of those changed I don't think they consider
like I say it's a broad category it's just I'm not economical but even attitudes on clothing and stuff I know
towards each other I know a lot of the things that men wear nowadays would have been considered feminine many years ago but I know it was hard for me at first
but now I kind of like a lot of the bright colors
I used to be more conservative and just your basic colors but now I do like some of these brighter fluorescent colors
but styles come and go all the time though it's just ridiculous fads in and out and even clothing from the sixties came back
I see a lot of girls wearing sixties clothes I guess the best thing I like to see from the sixties and seventies of course is the mini skirt of course one of the nice things
but I don't think that there's anything as original it's all based on one of the past styles they just make their circle and come back again
so if you hang onto your clothes long enough they'll be back in style in a few years
that's true maybe some day I probably won't be alive to see it but prices might go down lot more
I don't know though doesn't look good thinking back I think the only style I hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms
I remember that I do I guess when I look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms I say god
I didn't really care for them either but now I go ahead
I usually don't get to hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news
being by the time you get off work go by and pick up the baby from the baby sitter it's after six and by the time everything is settled in it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on anything I guess that's the way I am too sometimes I hear some things on the radio
I only get the newspaper on the weekends so
I don't even have time to read the newspaper except in passing
I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on I guess occasionally I'll hear someone at work say something though but
we have a news thing on the computer that I'll try to look at every day
and it's pretty much headline news
which isn't pretty much what we look for anyway
but do you think that the quality of the news events that you get are what do you think about it? I guess it's pretty good and the dallas area
and I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this there's a lot of pressure in that business to borderline at that
there's a lot of competition in the media
and sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines and that they'll run a topic into the ground
and they try to play public's opinion which I think is awful because it usually works I'll bet that was the case of the war in the middle east
that lots of new newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens trying to think what else is current
I don't know what to say
that's a bad one they looks like we're going to have an income tax in texas
I hate to see that but if what it's going to take we can deduct that from our federal income tax
but we need good schools we're more involved in that now and I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools that's true
I would think they could find a better way to fund it though but they haven't for
I wish they could have gotten a lottery they're struggling with it
I think the lottery could have helped with that it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax probably would have paid the same amount but it's not the idea of your paying income tax
I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that
it'll be interesting to see what happens trying to think what else is current
I haven't seen the news in a couple of days so it I'm a little behind on things the other thing I can think of is what is still going on in iraq and the kurd refugees that's sad
they had to choose between the better of the two bad situations and I don't know what I would have done in the situation
it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and finish the job while we were in there
but I understand why bush doesn't want to go in and take sides because that would definitely look like another korea
and he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though I'd agree with it I think he should've gone in there and blew them away seems to have helped him though popularity wise it did a lot
he did a real good job I believe I have in laws that live in saudi arabia that stayed there during all of it too
it so we kept very much abreast of what was going on were they in any of the areas where some of the scuds?
they were near dahran on the east coast
they were just north of it probably about a hundred miles from the kuwaiti border
and they stayed active was the military there taking supplies out to them in the desert
it was a new situation I'll bet I don't really have much more to say I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather and
you're right and that's awful in texas have you all been getting rain storms down there?
we got some awful rain the other morning and today's just been real drizzly we did last night some real massive thunderstorms
apparently I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too caused some damage it did? we may get some more tonight
we've just got slight chances of rain but we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning course while everybody was getting ready to go to work making nice traffic jams so the ground here is so flat and it's all saturated now
we're getting some flooding
last week we had all the rain? but I think we had about eight inches
it was between six and eight inches here where we are
and you walk out on the ground it's awful it's just so soggy it's a lot more humid down that way in fact miserable
today the air was just so sticky so damp I think there were places around downtown fort worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time like an hour or so just a bunch I guess that's it
it's that's about as much as we can do with current events
it was nice talking to you good talking to you michelle
let's see my husband does the majority of the gardening taking care of the lawn and fertilizing but I tend to all the planting the annuals and the spraying and taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and any kind of decorating for the holidays
I'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas but basically he does all the heavy stuff and I do all the fun stuff
we have it just opposite here my wife works and she's sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow I see
and we have about ten acres and she tries to mow about half of it that's a big job
it keeps it's doing real well because when we got this place the dirt was just overgrazed
it was bare dirt in a lot of places
and now since we've been mowing it and of course we water a little bit that's just too much to water all at once but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it
I bet it's beautiful
but we don't do much in the way of flowers we have one little flower garden that we work with
the rest of it is just wild flowers wild flowers
and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers
they're about a third the size of palm of your hand
and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush that sounds lovely
the wild flowers are beautiful I was thinking about throwing some in the back just way in the back behind the swing sets or just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved
my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing
she enjoys mowing I can't believe it I know a lot of
I hate it a lot of women do I've just never really maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow but my husband takes it on and I'll help rake up the grass and sometimes I'll help him edge because we don't have that much property but we're on a corner lot so there's a lot of edging to do
and that's what's nice about living more in the country you don't have to worry about any of that
we don't even have any concrete or asphalt
that's nice I this is different for us because the other in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks and it's been a little more country with the trees and we do miss that if we had a chance to move I think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as far as that goes
but we do everything together
this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the actually this fall I was talking about two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the soil and conservation people
and we're in the process of planting that's
and we're building a stand just to the north of our house and along the east property line
and I think what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because in the winter time when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you're not even there so I put
on the other side of the house though that's where we have all the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory
and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers and we planted those out by the septic so that they get plenty of water
and we get hummingbirds come in the spring all summer long
that sounds so pretty
and when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
they don't do any damage though they just fly right back out if you have the
they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat I see and when you're as busy as one of those babies you've got to eat most of the time I see
and we got a few we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders
but for the most part gardening for us is we got asparagus and we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries
we get the best strawberries that you just can't believe that sounds wonderful
we just got our last tomatoes I love home grown tomatos
there's nothing like them they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket
these are accidental tomatos what does that mean accidental tomatoes?
last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes of course you're going to lose some that way and the seeds go right through them I see and wherever they pooped
are you on an exercise program now or I exercise pretty regularly
I lift weights quite a bit
I run occasionally let's see what else do I do play golf some and I work out on a hanging bag I'm brown belt in karate so I keep up with that a little bit how about you
the only exercise program I'm doing right now is walking
I've got a nine month old and I'm four months pregnant with my second and so at the time walking seems to be the best it's something I can do with her plus doesn't tax me too physically
I have enjoyed aerobics in the past and I enjoy that because I like the group association like exercising with other people
and that's my favorite way to exercise that's neat I do walk some too my wife's about five months along
so she's been walking quite a bit so that is a good exercise for that
it's nice to do it together too I guess
my husband and I use to walk together but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to and so we very seldom get together to walk but when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule or do you go to groups or I do it on my own schedule
we used to try and belong to clubs or the y stuff like that but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive the distance you have to go
save the fees we've just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment so
and then you can do it whenever you want I guess I've got a weight bench and we got my wife an exercise bike and I use that sometimes too
it's a little more convenient but I guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over to do it
I guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are
because my husband used to work out three days a week at the texas instruments gym
and then I would just go on saturdays but since the first of the year neither one of us have been going
so I guess like I say we've been paying these fees and not going so it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it I think you really have to be disciplined
I try to work out at least a couple of times a week and I think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that you're in
with the walking I think they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial
and I have two friends that we walk they have babies that are about the same ages as mine and we've been walking every morning when it was cold we would go to the mall because you can't take the babies out very easily
so when we go we do about fifteen miles a week but the last little while for one reason or another we haven't been real consistent so it's a little harder when you're depending on other people to do it with you because you have to meet their schedules as well
but I enjoy doing it more when I've got other people with me
I usually do it because I know it's good for me not because I don't feel obligated to do it I enjoy it if I feel too obligated to do it I start to rebel and I won't be as consistent with it I understand did you exercise between your first child and your second?
I exercised pretty well up until I was pregnant and I started having pains so I've calmed down everything except I was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the walking
and I had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful but the t I rec center has an aerobics program for prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing
and I was going to wait until about my sixth month and then start that I did that with the second baby and I went to my exercise class one day and then she was delivered the next day
so it would seem to be real beneficial maybe it speeded up the process and all that
I think it made parts of it a lot easier and is this your first that you're having?
then I don't know how much you've been through it but I think parts of it made a lot easier and I've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other and they said that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier
and I had having both of them natural the first one was natural and going natural the second and it's rough but it's not as bad as I thought it would be and I think the exercise helped that's good
so do you work with t I? I don't my wife has been working with them
then she could go if she were interested
I think that's the class that meets on saturday mornings so she could find out if she wanted to go it's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process and so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial so at least it's something you enjoy I know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say I don't want to exercise it's too much work but there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards that's right
and sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like I've done a good job because I worked myself to that point but I guess that you don't want to overdo but have we reached our limit? I'm not sure how long we've been talking but I think we've talked about six minutes or so
it's been good talking to you been good talking to you as well
I hope your baby comes out well yours too about the weather
very appropriate I guess you ready for this?
john just a moment guess what we get to talk about the weather the weather this time of year has actually been kind of unusual I haven't expected it to be colder until like we've gotten the last couple of days
I don't know I fly for a living and I've the weather's been terribly unusual every where I've been you do
so you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather
I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather it was around here last night I'll tell you that
actually I've heard on the news that we will be setting a record here in the state of texas for the large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year that it's going to break all kind of records that were set back since nineteen thirty two no kidding so
if it keeps on raining like this and I understand it's supposed to rain until saturday night saturday or sunday they were saying
I know the systems have been real strong out I went through phoenix twice on wednesday morning
and approaches to low minimum both times
and phoenix never gets that kind of weather so
and so are you an airline pilot? I am for southwest
for southwest fantastic I have a brother that's a pilot also with american is that right?
I imagine with all this kind of weather it makes it kind of dangerous for you I wouldn't call it danger this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime
I guess so the air systems are reasonably calm the turbulence have a little bit of chop
but it's not like it is in the spring time
we moved actually down here from another location and it's spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain spectacular is the right word for them pardon me? spectacular is a good word for them I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in texas it's amazing
lights up the whole sky and even on a actually I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky it's a cloudless night and the rain isn't falling but you can see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth and what a light show
it's fabulous cloud to cloud it can be really sensational here
that's true where are you from originally?
I'm from northern utah and that's a very arid climate from salt lake city area
and there's always a lot of snow in fact where I grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to twelve different major ski resorts and so there was an awful lot of snow
and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and sleigh riding and everything else
so we had a great time were you near the park cities area
in snowbird and solitude and brighton and all those areas beautiful area
I imagine have you skied before? we've skied I have not skied that area
I've driven through it several times we skied california a bunch when we lived out there and of course we grew up in minnesota
and we do lot of cross country skiing there
do you think the weather is typical for this time of the year? not really
I minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already I think
and I've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today that moved in last night
it's been cold there was a time though in the middle part of november that got really cool really really unseasonably cool it did
and then it warmed right back up and I thought great
and that's a fun my wife was just listening here and she said yeah it froze in fact it was real cold but that was very unseasonable for us down here
but I've really enjoyed the weather down here too because two years ago we were the day after christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather and it's not as severe as the weather that I've experienced up in northern utah
that's real true same with us from minnesota it's in fact I've played golf on new year's day one year down here? not in minnesota
I have a brother in law that lives in minnesota and they say six months out of the year it's bitter cold and the wind and the blowing snow and everything it is it is
and they've had usually in minnesota they get their snow in january and february
and they're up over sixty five or
let's see I think I guess if I call I'm supposed to start I think that's the way everybody has done it so far
but anyway I think that we are paying a lot in taxes but I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money we're probably one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the as far as the quality of the streets the school systems the hospital stuff that the government gives money to all the things that the government does like that I think they need to manage it a little bit better but I don't think anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now so
I have to agree that
and you're right we do have a good government we do have a lot of things that the taxes are there to support but I do think they're mismanaged and I think that sometimes it's to easy of an answer it seems to say I'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or get all of the waste out of the spending
I don't know what y'all are paying in dallas but it seems like we pay the state there's the taxes set by the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts I came from california and when I left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was one of the highest in the nation I think it's seven here
seven point something
ourselves is seven point seven five whole state
it drives me crazy I'm thinking everybody is sitting here screaming about we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it where are you at? what state?
I'm in lubbock texas
there's we're still one of few that don't have the state tax
that's true and I did pay state tax in california but that the sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay that's true
you don't sound like you're from dallas where do you come from originally texas? I do I've lived in the dallas area here since I was four
it's an urban area I guess whatever I don't know
you just managed to escape the real texan accent
I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there I've just lived here
but I don't know I do I can think of all the biblical things about it too what did they say to I can't think of the scripture render unto caesar's what is caesar's
that's right even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and jesus said the money in the fisher inside the fish
and I thought of those two things when I was holding for a long time
were you really trying to find someone at home?
back then what they tried to do the would always try to stump jesus try to give him something that would contradict himself
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said you render unto caesar's what is caesar's you render unto god what is god's
and of course there I don't think they really cared about the answer
they just wanted to try and catch him in something
but I believe in paying taxes and like everybody else I try to take as many deductions as I can
I don't want to pay more than I have to
and I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons but I believe that they're necessary I really do are
do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or not really I spends a lot of time with our income tax though especially this year and last year I have been married for just a few years so I've had to really switch around from the e z form to the schedule a
all the deductions and all that
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder? it really did I saw that too
I didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions the interest and other things we're looking at buying a house
and that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house
and it will help tremendously
we bought ours five years ago and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back there's a thing I just I've been trying to learn as much as I can about it if you pay I know I get paid twice a month every two weeks that's once a month
I get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in thirteen months
that's right so if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying one month extra every year
that's right and if have you a thirty year note it will take seven or plus years off of your note
that's right my parents bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago
and they did that they thought their payment was automatically taken out every other wednesday
and that's exactly right everyone though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years or something like that
just because of exactly what you said you're making one more month's payment every year and that's going on the principle it doesn't pay any interest
or usually it doesn't so that's a good way to do it
and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment but not significant amounts
it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner that's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty
we're not going to go longer than twenty
but we're taking our time we're going to try to make our decision by july
that's good though we just started two or three weeks ago
and we're not going to just kill ourselves just two or three houses a week at the most that's good though
is it kind of a buyer's market down there?
that's good credit union has nine percent interest
that's pretty excellent so that's I don't know we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now
that's good but anyway I can't think of a whole lot more to say
I can't either I appreciate the call though me too
I enjoyed talking to you same here my wife she went to the school out there in lubbock in lubbock? she was there for two or three years before we got married I guess before I even met her just a second go ahead but anyway so she was at school out here? she went to school there
what was her name? cathy walker
I didn't know any walkers
good luck in your house hunting thanks a lot y'all work at t I? I do you do
I'm in human resources
that's interesting I work in the waiver
do you really because that's I work with elma
and I used to work I did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years
and then I have been in human resources for the last two years and I work with those same people all those nine years so I feel kind of part of the staff
I'm turning in a capital request right now
you are that's funny that's where you're from what are trying to get? a machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers
so you work in back grind? I'm sort of an acting process engineer
not officially but that's pretty much what I do that's what you do and do you? and
good deal what did you think of sam? I like him he's hard but we needed that that's good he's
he was very good for lubbock when he came to it was the same kind of thing he had a lot of good results that's what he said here
he's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before
that's been a real big plus
he's broadened the devices that we're making too which has made us as lot more stable
that's good anyway it was nice to talk to you
you too and they're are going to interrupt us any minute now I can tell
I know they will and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed me too
have a good day you too
what movies have you seen recently valerie?
let's see the last one we saw was thelma and louise we haven't seen that one yet
don't bother it wasn't that good
from a woman's point of view it was very chauvinistic as far as women go it was entertaining but I don't think the general audience would go for it the most recent one that my wife and I have seen was the city slicker
how was that? that was excellent it was just a really funny movie
that is one I've been dying to see at the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad it just ran the gamut of emotion
and but it was just all around entertaining
how long did that movie run? it's still on to the best of my knowledge
but time wise how long was it two hour
or I think it's less than two hours
we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever
that always seems to happen when you rent them but this one it was fairly long I'm guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes maybe
and it but excellent acting by billy crystal and bruno kirby was it good
who was the jack palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy
so we really enjoyed that
I'm looking forward to seeing that one that was next on our list so I think that I can highly recommend that movie to see good deal
good deal do you rent movies very often or we generally rent a couple a week in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on thursday
they get taken up at the store that's exactly right so
we will rent two or three movies on thursday and with luck you'll have one or two that are good
most of them are a coin flip
and we usually have we don't get out as much as we like we have two children so we occasionally get out to the movies
but it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends
and we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see and generally try to stay in the at least p g range
what ages are they? have you found trouble finding movies for them or
the oldest is nine the youngest is three he doesn't really pay attention
the five year old doesn't have the attention span either
but the nine year old will watch anything that's on t v
they have been doing that we've been waiting for a good movie out this summer for the kids to see the last one they saw was home alone and they enjoyed that but I missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so my wife took the kids to see that one but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch
that's a good deal the we saw this movie presumed innocent was the one we rented last weekend
let me think if I have rented that one harrison ford
harrison ford and how does the story line go? he is a prosecuting attorney and a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
we haven't seen that one and he's trying to find it but course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her and it's an extremely long movie
it's over two hours long
which my wife she likes the suspense movies I enjoy them to a degree I think that's the one I wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me so I thought I better save that one for another day save that for another day
because I think he'd like that one
you enjoyed that one then it's something I think you would enjoy
that's a good one to put on the list it's like most suspense movies what was it was on t v recently fatal attraction
it's one that once you've seen it once you really can't see it again
you know all the story and who did what and when it happened
so once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's not good for a second watching particularly
at least I don't think so
I don't think too many of them are anymore it's a shame but I don't know we've watched weekend at bernie's any number of times I know it's just slapstick comedy
sit there and laugh and my one grandson and I my wife can't understand it but we like bill and ted's excellent adventure which is another funny one
we've heard about that one but we haven't seen that one either so it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies we like to laugh
I have a theory I like movies for entertainment I don't want to go away depressed from watching a movie I agree I agree life's depressing enough
that's for sure I've certainly enjoyed talking with you you too jim
thanks for punching in and have a nice weekend
I hope you see a good movie soon pat
one of the interesting things that I have considered about the role change for women is that women of my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the leave it to beaver housewives but we are not living in that world we are certainly not our families have changed
families society has changed
everything has changed
that's one of the and it makes you really concerned I am glad I raised guys
let the world train them what to do but characteristically the women have been in the past trained in the home
and I really would be at a loss to raise and train a girl I think I would it's even raising boys today is different though because they are expected to do so much more than they used to
used to be they would just go off to work and come home and everything was done and it's a different world it's some good some bad
it's nice that there's a choice
I have chosen to stay at home and raise my children
and I have a ten year old and a twelve year old
and I was a single parent for awhile and worked
and that was great and I was able to provide for my children and that was wonderful
but I thank god everyday now that I have that choice and that I am able to do things at home
and I volunteer a whole lot
and that's my job right now and I love it I really love it
I did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said mom please do not be involved
then I went back to work and that will come
I know that day will come
and I am looking forward to that too
but that's a different phase in my life
and I am glad that I am able to do what I want to do right now
there's a lot of things that have happened actually and it's like oil on top of water it changes but it's never different in a lot of ways
women at one time did very heavy physical labor and were expected to maintain a household
then as times changed as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor even in housekeeping and homemaking
there's not a lot of physical labor because there are you are not beating rugs
you are not doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
and in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion
or we really do develop some health problems
so in that respect I am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit
and but don't you think it's that way with men too? men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more than they used to
absolutely true that's true with society in general
but specifically the woman's role in society has changed
and medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases
heart disease was characteristic of men
now there's almost equally predominant in women and I and stress disorders and things like that
and I think that that's a symptom of our society it's a symptom that there's a general illness that needs to be healed I do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem I am not god
but I do know that in raising my boys I really did meet a lot of pressures saying you need to get them into music lessons you need to get them into sports
you need to get them into this they need to be busy and they need to be active and I fought all of those things I said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me and they will say mom this is important to me I want to do it
otherwise I will guard their ability to have quiet time it's funny
I refused to cram their lives full it's funny it's funny I was really looking forward to summer thinking we are going to have some time off and that's the way it is with a woman too
and it's been real busy and actually today is really as far as I am concerned the first day of summer because we have had so much going on the past few weeks and you are right
that's how society has changed
the family has changed we find ourselves doing things that we never did as kids
I do not remember being involved in things like this it's different
it's just I do not know only time will tell whether it's better or worse than the way we grew up
but it's just very different of course
I just am very much a believer in quiet personal time if you do not have the time to talk to yourself who are you going to talk to
and I guarded my children's rights for that and I think that that's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do they are sacrificing their time with themselves there's nothing wrong with sitting and being bored if you thinking internally and you are working on your own self you are finding out who you are but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and get homework done
I think and where do you find the time
in the first place it's not your homework it's your children's homework
and I was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help
I helped them with exactly what they asked for and that's all that's a part of the problem that women have always had and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people's responsibilities that's very true
they and then that way we have not changed in hundreds of years have we that's right
that way husbands are crippled
they are intellectual cripples and so are children
they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible for themselves I do not know why god made women brilliant I didn't he though
but I do not know they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems they are all things to all people that's very true
and that's never changed that's very true as a matter of fact I was talking to a friend yesterday who said she has a new policy in her home and when her family comes to her and says fix this I am having a problem with another member of the family
she said I have taken a new stance and I say no I will not
you work it out for yourself
and it's amazing she said
every single person in this family expects me to get and they suck me into these arguments and these conversations
that's right and I am supposed to be the one who is going to fix it all and soothe everybody and she said I am not doing it anymore I just
I think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful and I think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it and that is mediation training
we are not talking about strikes or things we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises parents and children husbands and wives boss and employee those kinds of things interpersonal mediation because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who do you have are you there? there
had to mess with my phone here do you have children? I have one how about you? I have three do you work? I do
I do I work and brian's in a day care center he was two in december
so he's not quite two and a half yet
he I put him I'm kind of had different ideas from what probably the majority of people have
I put him in a day care center from the very beginning he started in day care when he was eight weeks old
and I just I don't know I have kind of the opposite opinion of most people
I have had this real problem with a private individual I kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with private individual when the door shuts that one person has total control
and I always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around
and if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it
they can watch and I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less because there's
how can you help depending on the day care center
you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers have you ever noticed they're always a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it kind of thing it's a family thing
you never hear about it really in the big ones
so that's what I did and I have had just excellent luck
I have been just so happy he's I was just going to ask you if you liked the but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there I know but
he was in the same center for the first two years
and it was wonderful and I loved it and I was so happy there and the woman who owned it sold it
but I thought I'm going to keep an open mind here
and the people who came in it just wasn't the same wasn't the same
and their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine
and I left him there for about a month and just decided I can't do this anymore and I moved him which was an extremely traumatic experience
but he's done well was it?
he's been there a couple of months now
and I just feel so lucky
that's great that's good
how about you? do you work or do you get to stay home with them? I got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years my oldest one is ten and a half now or she's
it's was about ten years so I was really happy that I was able to do that but I that's what I wanted to because I just couldn't wait to have kids and so if I was so anxious to have them and I couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly to go back to work as soon as I had them so
so it was really great by the end of the ten years I was really ready to go back to work
I bet and my youngest was only two and a half
she was already two and a half
so she wasn't an infant a baby
so I felt real good about that but I tell you with summer coming up I'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what I'm going to do I guess I went back to work about a year and a half ago
and I worked full time all last year and now I'm going to school part time and graduate school and I'm working part time and so I'm still
I know how that goes I'm still going full time but I only have half time salary
and when school lets out I have no idea what I'm going to do because I certainly can't afford what we did last year which was
did you have them in a center or something last summer? we did we had all different things we sent them to camp one first month in june they went to summer school then the second month they one my daughter went home to visit my mom for a while and my son went to camp and there we had some forget what else we did but it was all really expensive
that stuff is expensive it really is so they're a year older
and I my daughter's going to be eleven this summer and my son will be nine and a half and so I'm not I think I can leave them home
for a if I can work part of the day I'm going to leave them home
I was going to say they're getting to the age where you should be able to trust that a little bit
in fact I'm doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before I do
that's okay but the four year old I have had her before I went back to work really in a home day care situation
and we've just been really thrilled with it too we were what actually we it took us two or three different people to find
to find the right one
that's what we have to do though but I wasn't embarrassed to shop around
so the person we found it through the there's an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that
where do you live? in plano
plano? and they have a number you can call and all these people are registered with their association and go our care provider
care provider she goes to seminars and
that's wonderful she gets home visitations by the state boards some of them and then some by the association and they have weekly meetings and everything and so it's just really really well regulated
that's great and she's just great in fact she's all upset because galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall and she says this is it I'm not going to have her anymore and I said don't count on that after noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten
but we've tried everything and one year when I went back to work I had my son was eight at the time just barely eight and we put him in amrein's day care after
I've heard that they were very good
that's why we picked it because they were supposed to be real great and I think they were fine but the thing is he was in school all day in second grade
in plano it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls
so there is a hundred and twenty second graders in the same area with no walls
and then he'd get on the amrein's bus to go to amrein's and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room
you know what fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty
poor kid was in school all day
because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself and having some peace and quiet or
even at that age they need that time
we all need that time just some quiet time to wind down from the day
that's exactly it so another thing that we tried to do we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and stuff like that and
I think that's really important
and we've already started about how young can they start t ball and soccer?
I just we both think of that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that it is and you could hardly wait it is and
he's so much fun now
he's really starting to get lots of fun and I can't wait until stuff like that starts happening I bet
and we did the easter egg hunts which was really the first year he was really able to understand
and to know what he was doing and enjoy it
and it was so much fun and he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant and he got up on this elephant all by himself you're kidding
and I couldn't believe it you're kidding
they had so much fun that's great
I bought us tickets and stood there in line and I thought I'm going to end up on this elephant with him
he did it by himself good for him
so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really getting fun
day care has just done just incredible stuff with him and he comes home with something new everyday and so I know they're working with him that's great that's so good
and he's excited to get there in the morning and just doesn't even want to kiss me good bye
it's just bye and he goes running he's out of there
and he's always having fun when I pick him up so this day care is
it's bright steps in lewisville and
whenever you say bright steps everybody goes I've heard that's the best day care in town
and it's one of those that's very hard to get into
and this woman owns three day cares two in lewisville and one in irving
and she had to open the second one up in lewisville because her waiting list was just a year old it was ridiculous
and she's got two day cares within three blocks of each other
so it's she knows something right that she and
she knows what she's doing about half the teachers are degreed teachers that makes such a difference
it makes a huge difference that's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too
and I think that really makes a difference
they're in it because it's a profession not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else that's right that's right
that's right and his old day care as much as I loved it
and the owner I really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else
and I got lucky and all of his teachers were very good because
sometimes that's fine that's great
but then sometimes sometimes it isn't you just have to
is it real expensive then?
it just went up the first of this month I'm paying seventy nine dollars a week for now so it's a little high
but it's like where he was before I was only paying sixty three so there's quite a little jump there
but I looked all over lewisville I looked in every day care there was in lewisville
and there were places that were cheaper but is it
your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money and I have peace of mind where he is
and some of those other places I wouldn't have that's exactly it we do the same thing since galen goes to nursery school we pay for our day care provider full time for a whole week
but she's gone three mornings galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week
but I said to her I said it doesn't matter if for whatever when school holidays come around I used to have such a problem with that
they wouldn't have anything to do I'd either have to ladies first
I don't find a lot of time to watch t v and a lot of time I find it during the day when I'm rocking my little girl to sleep so I watch a lot of reruns old shows like dick van dyke all those old crazy shows barney fife I guess
I really enjoy watching andy griffith so you're a homemaker?
I guess that's the right term nowadays
I guess so I am I stay home with two kids my wife we have a new one in the house and she stays home too also
I guess I have a wide variety I like watching the t v for things that are interesting not so much the things that aren't for example the cosby show to me is just kind of a waste of my time and different strokes
but I like sixty minutes prime time live
of course I have to watch cartoons on saturday morning but not the ninja turtles I like the old timey ones tom and jerry
you sound like my husband there you go
he likes tom and jerry and bugs bunny and all his friends and all those guys johnnie quest the good ones
if I'm ever home during the day on a vacation day I have to catch at twelve o'clock the andy griffith show because he's one of my idles
but I don't know it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic magnified and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings
and so now I do with the cosby show I have seen it a couple of times and I do I like the show I just don't watch it because of the timing
but some of the crap that's on t v nowadays it's about
I do watch the special shows that they come out with the nova stuff and the nature shows
but I think there's enough out there to pick from I'm not we don't have cable to the point of the h b o or any of that stuff but
I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children because with two kids
and I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch or I used to be really hooked on all my children me
and I watched that for ten or fifteen straight years
and then I'd eat at work we'd have a t v or whatever and then as my kids got older and started recognizing what was going on I thought this isn't really very good
so I gave it up fifteen years bet they hated that
I had watched it since it started so
now I don't know who the characters are and I'll turn it on every once in awhile and I don't recognize anybody so I guess that's a good sign I used to watch I can recall this might date me here I can remember staying home when I was five and six and my mother watching the edge of night
you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm and the edge of night secret storm
I think they were back to back and black and white
I was just a youngster and I was
we used to my mother watched all that stuff too and I think as the world turns may still on or not still be on
it was not too long ago now they got a lot of other crap involved and so
you're right I think some of the tones of the daily prime time is questionable
and that could be I have to agree with you
keep them on the channel twenty one the nature stuff
we do and it's real interesting too the difference in my kids my oldest loved sesame street and those kind of shows
my younger one doesn't she's more into walt disney kind we watch a lot of movies that we've got on tapes and stuff
she's more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing but we do a lot of kid watching
sounds like you got your hands full there and I do appreciate speaking with you
it was fun have you gotten your catalog yet?
I don't think so I just spoke with jim I just got my in the mail and it inspired me to make more phone calls
I don't really I've had a few people call me but I've never made one
I need to get brave give them your pen number
that's what I need to do have a good day
what movies do you like?
I like just about anything I think the last one we saw was teenage mutant ninja turtles part two I like the turtles my little boy's four and he loves them
we don't have any kids but we like them anyway that's okay how old are you all?
we're late twenties and you just don't have any yet I've got two
my little girl is three months old and my little boy just turned four I had his birthday party yesterday
but he's a turtle fanatic he even had turtle cake yesterday but I've been wanting to see turtle two is it as good as they say it is?
it was it was actually better than the first one I thought what's the last movie you saw? ghost
when the topic came up I was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw he said ghost and turtles I really liked it ghost I love tearjerker movies but that wasn't too bad on tearjerker but it was good movie not too awful bad though I can see why it won so many oscars
because that was just so good and I like demi moore
did you see pretty woman? but I've been hearing a lot about it we don't get to the video store very often and we don't have cable
we don't really want cable it's just glued to the t v all the time anyway
so we get two channels down here I'm from kentucky originally
and we used to get five channels without cable
forty I don't think you all have the same channels but here in texas we only get two channels and that's do you watch soap operas?
once in a while when I'm home you work then?
we get the channel with young and the restless on it
and then I think general hospital and that comes on different channel
it does but that's all we get and that's no cartoons for my little boy but we've got a v c r and a lot of tapes
and my husband is a movie fanatic
I think you would really like pretty woman it was really a it made you feel really good it was just a happy movie what about total recall have you seen that
I saw that one that's good
I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was it was violent I try to get away from that my little boy he loves robo cop and that movie I'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is have you seen it?
the part where they're shooting mercy
I don't like that that's horrible that is horrible and the language on that's filthy
I don't see why they have to do that everybody knows that the language is there so they could just ignore it and use different words instead I think I know
but I think lately pretty woman's been my favorite I went and bought the video I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times my husband bought me pretty in pink for my birthday with a wait a second I will in a minute kyle
that's okay he bought me pretty in pink just a second you're glad you ain't got a four year old
that's okay I haven't seen pretty in pink this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls
does that have molly ringwald? molly ringwald
it was cute but it wasn't I like sixteen candles or sixteenth birthday or
I think sixteen candles was the name of it that was so good of course I was a teenager when I seen that and I loved it
I haven't seen it either if you like love stories it's sweet
I do it's sweet it really is and that's a tearjerker it gets you it makes you feel really sorry for her
but it's hilarious too especially with that little guy in it he looks like a little boy next door
but he's sixteen it's a cute movie I can't remember his name he kind of looks like doogie howser
I don't know don't know either he's got curly blonde hair he just a little freckly little boy
probably know him if I saw him if I could remember the name I know you'd know his name because he's played in a few movies but
I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was sleeping with the enemy I've heard about that but I can't remember it
that's julia roberts new movie julia roberts is good
she's this one you know pretty woman was kind of a light comedy and a romance
and this one was a lot more dramatic wasn't it a murder mystery? sort of
it was a mystery she disappeared from her husband who was abusing her that's the one I wanted to see where she was at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something
did that come on t v or did it come out in the
it came out in the theater
and I think around here it's all ready quit playing but I don't know if it's still playing any where else I think
but it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat real good
I want to see that I seen the previews for it on t v down here but it's just been down here a couple weeks I think because we saw it probably four or five months ago a month
I know it hasn't been that long since I've seen the previews for it but I wanted to see it her husband was a dark haired guy with a beard and moustache or he shaved the beard off
he was a real psycho in the movie
it was scary I'd like to see that what about there was a we got one back here a while I want to see war of the roses too have you seen that?
I didn't like it you didn't?
it was I didn't like the way it ended I know the only reason I know why it ended is on arsenio hall one night christopher reeves told that
I can't believe they killed them
or who was it christopher reeve or mike douglas
might have been michael douglas that starred in it
it was michael douglas christopher reeve wasn't in it at all?
arsenio hall is the one that jumped up and said that I can't believe they killed them and christopher reeve or mike douglas went after his throat you dummy so I know that they die but I haven't told my husband we've both been wanting to see it
it was weird it was a different movie from anything I've ever seen we was teasing about splitting our house down the middle
they did that didn't they and they marked off routes that they could go or something
that would be kind of hard for us we've only got one bathroom I don't know we've got two bathrooms but if he takes my house kind of looks like two trailers put together and one bathroom is at the end of one side and one's in the middle of the other so we could do it
that wouldn't be too bad and he could climb out the window
and our whole house has every room leads to three rooms so we can
get around you can get around you just can't go out the front door honey
did you see fatal attraction? that's coming back on too
I know it's going to be on c b s tuesday night and that's kind of in a way how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff
that's kind of how war of the roses was I
parts of war of the roses was funny but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling eerie feeling or I want to see it though I'd like to see that and the never ending story came out on disney this month I think
I've heard about that I wanted to see that but I don't know what it's about the never ending story?
it's a child's movie but it's good I enjoyed it
I love disney movies I do too and
they're some of the best that are made and it's about this little boy who I think he's up in a attic or some part of school he got locked in the school and he got scared but he starts dreaming and then he's saving the land of it's been so long since I've seen it
alls I can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing
it flies through the air and he's trying to save the land from some ooze
but it's really good it sounds it had fred savage in it did you see that movie with fred savage in it though
I don't think so with he had it was the princess bride
I didn't see that you didn't see that that was cute that was a good one I like slapstick comedy
so do I and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than I heard a friend of mine told me she got naked gun last night and she said that was hilarious
we saw that and they're coming out with a sequel to it two and a half
it was funny it I want to see that she said she rented it last night and said it was real good an
and working girl is really good I seen that that was good was that with that blonde she pretended to be the boss or something
I rented that one night by myself I was home alone did you see home alone?
I did that just reminded me of that did you like it?
let's see how do you feel about credit cards?
personally I do not care for them although I find them a necessity in business and so forth I try to refrain from their use as much as possible for a number of reasons one of which is the extreme interest rate on most of them
the one I use of course mostly only for business purposes is american express
and I'm not terribly in favor of them not for my own personal point of view
plus from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion I believe
at least that's one number for this range of numbers I have heard
do you use them frequently or me and my wife when we have extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget we'll use it but last year I think we paid I think it was twenty something cents interest on our visa
and this year I think we used it for christmas and we got caught just a few days on our grace period so we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars but we don't like to do that at all
and I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly we have several credit cards though we have a gas card our visa and then of course the american express and I think we have a couple of department stores
but we use it the same way and
I find the one I use mostly aside from the american express I do use my sears card
but as with the american express I try to pay it as it comes in
it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill that's usually how we do it
I know when I used to travel overseas quite a bit what I would do on my american express card is before I left I would mail a check to american express and have some idea of how much was there I'd sent them several hundred dollars or whatever I felt I would spend and then use it then
but for hotels and so forth but I knew that it was paid I knew that I had that much credit going in
sometimes I would go over but it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that I would have it covered in that respect
that's good I don't think we've gone that far to pay it in advance before we spend it
but I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it like that that may be good
I found in traveling overseas that often it would expedite things to have an american express credit card for hotel bills and so forth
plus when they would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate
so the only time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically
for example I remember on one trip to france when I started planning the trip a dollar was worth nine or ten francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically
and when I finally got over there it had fallen two or three francs to the dollar so the
so I got caught a little short in that regard
but I was anticipating my room would cost
if it were sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so or maybe twenty
maybe it would be more than that it was more than it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate
but then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time
of course the government was several months behind on its per diem for exchange rate
so there's a little consternation in trying to get them to compensate for the difference in the exchange rate especially
that was the only time I really got caught short but as I said most of all I try not to use them lavishly in that regard that's good
from where are you calling? from the dallas area
you're from I'm from maryland
do you work for t I? I work for g t e
I wonder how t I got g t e involved I know jack godfrey
I know him very well I've known jack for a long time and I'm also in the speech business
so when I heard that jack was going to do this I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this
and so that's how I got involved you have a very what's the word your speech is very exact
thank you very much but as jack said I'm one of the old hands in the speech business
I've been doing it for twenty some odd years
and so I was very much interested in getting involved in switchboard
so you work for t I? I work in
I guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording I think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject so I think you get ten so I think we're okay
you have a good evening you too it's been pleasant talking to you same here take care
what kind of hobbies do you have?
I do a lot of cross stitching and painting when I do have spare time I like cross stitch too
I love it I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately
that's my case also I've got a new born and there's just no time
have you been cross stitching long? several years my husband is even interested in it now he likes to help me design projects that are a little more customized
he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the material not that hard
it's not I really enjoy it
and once you get started on it I love it
I do a lot of my own patterns also
in fact I did one bill the cat from glenn county that was a real good one to do
it was tough but do you have any others or is this mainly cross stitching? I do mostly that not very artistic really for painting and stuff but I don't know
I'm still trying to get all the d m c colors I've got the kits to put them all in I don't have them all yet certainly
I got to counting the other day and I think I have two hundred and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is it can add up quick I just keep an inventory of what I currently have and then when I start a new project I go through and see if I just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on
I see now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead what comes close because a lot of them are similar
a lot of times you can do that I think I the pinks there's forty two different shades of pink
there's lots of pinks and greens pinks and greens
there's lots of shades of greens but the colors I just love all the different colors
they had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to but you don't have much spare time either? not lately I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there
and that does take some time and if we're trying to get acclimated with having a baby and how old?
he's seven months old and just into everything so there's not a spare moment
but I wouldn't trade it for the world I've been trying to do some bibs for him and work on his christmas stocking
we missed it last year so hopefully this year he'll have one last year he was a little bit young for having one
he wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway you would have but
if it tasted good all he liked was the lights this year so
that's neat that you like cross stitching also that's kind of strange that we got the same call it's a call
I'm sorry go ahead that's okay
but I've been doing it for probably ten years or so I just started about five years ago I think
but it is peaceful it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it there's also a couple of large projects baby afghans and I got one done and I think the child is going to be in high school before I get finished on that bear thing
is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the large squares? I bought the cloth and the pattern for it I didn't buy a kit
I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross stitching it's that cloth it's cloth I think
and it has the borders and everything already
those are pretty number one turned out just great and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery and I didn't even know it
that's a I gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we used I said didn't that was a good it worked out that way
that's great that now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it
I like those those are pretty lilly she said it's for your daughter to use she said I know she doesn't get to touch it she hung it on the wall
my grandmother made us a couple of quilts for the baby and I was I don't want to mess those up
they're just too nice you don't get many hand made quilts anymore I've enjoyed this
but keep up the good keep up the cross stitching you too
are we paying too much in taxes and are we getting what we pay for? what's your opinion? it's kind of a broad subject I think there are some areas where we pretty well get our money's worth
but I also think there are a lot of areas especially in federal government where we're short changed lot of money spent for things that are not used and I was in the air force and there was equipment at every base I was ever on that was just going to waste it was just sitting and rusting and
I tend to agree with you when it comes to government spending there are so many studies done that don't mean anything
but we'll spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on
and it's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist but it could be put to more practical use and I think that it's a tone of our times that politicians are into themselves more than they are into doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which is really unfortunate
that is true I agree with you in that area I have a tendency to I'm from texas and I read how our politicians voted each week in the paper
and it's interesting how the votes vary and what they ran on in platform don't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or congress whatever
and don't really respond to people who write them and call them and unless they're in the limelight and under pressure so I think we get short changed on that
that's very true what state do you live in? texas that's
what do you think about robin hood? I work for school district and it has hurt us a lot there has to be some way to equalize education opportunities but I think especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it and I don't that's just not true I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or problem solving skills I think there are too many things that money can't buy that are important as far as education is concerned that's true what school district do you work for? richardson I work for plano we're comparable
as a matter of fact I just paid my richardson taxes because I live in richardson and supplemented the robin hoods very thoroughly I think we have got it on the line don't we our taxes went up tremendously
and it's not going to get any better it's going up and up and up I used to live in the plano school district and there was a taxpayers organization that finally communicated the message to the people in plano that we didn't want our taxes raised
I remember there was about four five years ago
but this I think living in richardson we're kind of spoiled because I think we come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned than probably any city in the country
did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the administrators pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers is that incredible?
that's the biggest mess I've ever heard of how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you have to lay people off?
but I'm not going to complain because we all got a pay raise this year
you all got a pay raise this year
is that correct? I think the teachers did and I don't know about administrators I'm semiretired and I was an administrator so I don't get a raise anymore I work part time and just get
my pay doesn't change
are you on the early retirement?
are you enjoying it? very much course I still work two part time jobs so it's not really total retirement
it's interesting because when you look at what richardson has done with the early retirement you I'm sorry that's okay I didn't hear hobbies
let me see I don't know if that took or not I'll do it again
what are your hobbies? I hear you have kids?
you heard her in the background that's babies that's your full time hobby?
takes a lot of time I like most sports I like to do that I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing
little bit of embroidery work once in a while
what do you like to do? I try to do some painting although I'm not very good at it
I'm sure you probably are not really
you like it that's the main I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be that's right so I always try
I do some sewing mostly out of necessity I'm making drapes for my house just because I'm
that's hard sewing it isn't and it is it is actually the sewing isn't the hard part it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room measure it and get it to
it depends on how elaborate you get it if you get pleats and all kinds of I've been doing that and that
that's a lot of work that but usually have to do the pleats by hand so that at least I can do watching t v or whatever but
and I've gone and put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through but
that feels really good so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but I need to do it
to do it let's see I have a dog and a lot of fish keeping fish is my biggest hobby keeping fish
they're probably easier than keeping dogs though aren't they it depends on how frequently they die and how much that bothers you
how much that bothers you and you probably have to clean out the tank too that's you don't have to do as much as I thought in fact my problem I had fish as a kid and they always died immediately
and what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean
you're kidding because you have
because they need to have a little bit of the you need to let the bacteria build up and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance
I see and I would just take everything out and just wash it with scalding hot water
and it would kill all the bacteria and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again and so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably so
that's right so now I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing
and I don't try and sterilize things don't go through the whole nine yards and they kind of need a little bit of that that's right that's right
so you've had fish for a long time I've had them I guess it's been two years now I've had a tank here and then back at home I used to have a small five gallon tank but that never worked well and I have fifty five gallons now what size do you have now?
that's a good size it's a lot easier
have you ever had it crack or break or leak not yet
fifty five gallons you'd hope it would never do that that's right I really do but
do you have all kinds of different fish or I just have what they call community fish guppies and platies and basic things
I don't get into the
real exotic the expensive ones
they're probably harder to take care of and they are they're very expensive and when they die it's more like an investment
I bet it is you lost an investment so
do you have problems with the fish eating each other? not really only if there's baby fish
you always have to isolate those then you have to how do you isolate them? you get a
a jar or something or they have breeders
it's a little plastic things that sort of floats
and you put the mother fish in there and then it's got a trough underneath her
so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either
and that's it kind of works but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate
and on occasion if you get a real small one it'll fit out the slots
it'll go through the slot that's right but it works I guess
that works all right then they don't want the mothers to be with the little fish either they'll eat them they will isn't that odd
you wouldn't think that and it's funny because the one I have every single month without fail she has babies
you're kidding all the time and I and she's supposed to her variety it says they won't eat the babies and I've seen her do it so
and that just makes you sick almost doesn't it? it's it makes you understand that things are different
things are different in the animal kingdom we might decide what's proper and what isn't but that's the way it is for them
that's kind of the way they do it that's it
survival of the fittest or something because if the baby is strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide
go hide from them and then you think how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that
but if you're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies not really
I try I play a couple of instruments
how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes?
we my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class
he's an aerobics instructor and is going to be entering north texas for a kinesiology program there
and the how I met him was through the aerobics class that he used to teach you're a student?
so I'm an avid aerobics person and just very very athletic
enjoying anything dealing with sports
and how do you feel about it? I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise I don't feel like I
I don't very often do things for the sake of exercise I don't feel well unless I am exercising and I try to do things that involve exercise but I very rarely do things like I've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time
but I do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and I spend a lot of time and I probably get more exercise than your average person but it's not a structured sort of thing and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake
and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that
I've my that's the way my mother stands on it she feels like if it's something that you have to do if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes a chore
and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore and I feel that way too as far as the idea of doing fifty sit ups or something to
you're a calculated down and do your calisthenics three times a week
I do try and regulate how much exercise I get a week
is that why you like aerobics classes because someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore?
and it's got and I've always enjoyed dance
so it involves I can't get out to dance all the time and would that we could
and it's more regulated I mean you're using different parts of the body
so it is like dance and it's structured like that but you have the music and like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me
and someone else is telling me let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much
you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself
but I'm like you I also like to participate in things like we just went to the myererson symphony run this past weekend and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people and just get out out and about
and it's something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was quite a lot of fun
and biking and I love to swim so I love it when it's swimming weather
and you're talking to someone from california where it's often swimming weather
I didn't realize that I'm sorry
I'm in texas I just assumed that I had this is the first call I've done and I didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from all over the country
you wouldn't know that I so it's actually it's interesting because there are real regional differences in california there's almost an assumption unless you're sort of clearly of an older generation or something in your sixties or something like that
I'm not there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness at least in urban california and maybe not I don't know about rural california too well but in urban california it's just for all I know aerobics started out here I don't know where they actually started but the craze really picked up big here and before that there was the running craze and they california tends to be a bit faddish but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere
so there must be something to some of them and
I think people are more people from california seem to be more health motivated all around as far as the diet and just your health consciousness and it just seems like a lot of those ideas generate out of california
not just exercise but health related ideas
and I it's curious I don't know why don't know if it's do you does california have a there's a sense of it being a package
I think there is a sense of whole there's a lot of you'll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and the university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter which turned into a fairly well subscribed to newsletter monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that
and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it's on fairly solid scientific ground it's just dispensed with these distinctions it says all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they combined them all together so it's had that orientation for quite some time there's been some progressive medical schools out here that have taken that approach and
do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health that you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program
do you think the program came first or the that there's a I can say there's a correlation but I couldn't say which caused the other each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
the more money they put into it and
I can see that and cause I knowing from institutes of learning like that I know that they've got to get their money somewhere and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so exactly and part of it is california back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements
and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was people becoming interested in alternate practices I'm not sure if it was a meditation practice or if it was similar to a stress management practice or alternates to a m a approved medicine you have major acupuncture schools and things out here and you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things
and before long you get this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of health care and options
and exercise is strongly considered one of them the irony is it's people in the cities that are most oriented towards doing the exercise and I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally the laborers last thing or they're older pardon me
don't you think they tend to be older in the rural I sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city like everything else
I live in a rural area so I see that the rat race to exercise
it's frantic to achieve something that a person in a rural area almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree but stays almost healthier I think so
as a fit person you've if you look at other cultures I know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in china and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise and they combine it with a meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation
and they seem pretty they don't have the hard body they don't have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious but they live to a hundred and ten some and that's
don't you think a lot of that is diet too? and a lot of that is diet that's true
they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat for economical reasons not for preference
and as we can see I'm a practicing vegetarian so I've read a lot of information knowing that to be true am I actually
what's that? as am I are you also
that's good as far as the is that pretty predominant as far as california it is in the urban areas
in the urban areas? for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
that's wonderful most sort of modern looking restaurants will you can
that's great we it's such a trouble here you just have to eat at home basically I was wondering that because I was actually applying for a job in texas and it occurred to me
of course in the cities
in the cities we live close to dallas
so which you get an influx of a lot of people from all over the country so you're going to have more choices
but in urban areas it's steak places and it's not a
it's definitely it's changing to a degree but it's very frustrating and even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or organic materials and foods and things
you don't really have that you would think
do you have any pets?
I have three cats and a dog sound like us we have go ahead
we just got the dog less than a year ago so he's still a puppy what kind is it?
he's a mixed breed he's part collie part shepherd and part chow more collie and shepherd than chow so you
the only chow he's got is his tongue he's got a blue tongue?
he's got little spots on them we have two chows and a miniature schnauzer and recently added a guinea pig which wasn't by my choice but I was out ruled but the dogs are mainly mine and my but I just love them to death
was the guinea pig for your child? daughter
as if the dogs weren't enough had to have a guinea pig so anyway she enjoys her though so that's what matters but our chows we've had them right around six maybe seven years and
they're registered and we've been breeding them she's had about four or five litters
my husband's always wanted a chow but I'm kind of concerned about having cats and how they socialize with cats which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed
because we thought they would socialize easier
my husband had originally wanted an and his brother has an and so far he's bitten ten people and the people that he got the from used to have cats and they no longer have any other cats
it's telling we had a cat when we first married took we had the cat first and then we got the chow and bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her
and you would think that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and paw at their face and they'd just play and they never harmed her so they got along great I don't know how it would be bringing in cat to a full grown dog
I wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog
but I wouldn't feel hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats I think they would socialize easier I think so too
how old is your child? five five? she's a real
so you had the dogs before you had the baby? and I was not really concerned about them harming her I think a lot of that that we hear all the time is how you bring them up
and ours are real friendly they're protective but they're very friendly and lovable
you think they're lapdogs they'll just come jump on your lap and want to have their bellies rubbed and everything and
what color are they? the female's red and the male is black
I bet the black one's pretty he's a big old thing and I was concerned about the female mainly and as luck had it she had puppies the same week my daughter was born so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about
about your baby and that I think that really helped my daughter since she's little has been playing with them and they let her tug their hair and get on their back or whatever and she's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her so
I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything I do too
but I think it really helps them to understand when they go to other people's houses and they have pets I see so many times kids just they mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings that or the other extreme they're terrified of them and I hate that
and they shouldn't be some maybe but our miniature schnauzer she's just a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly and a lot of kids are scared of that which I understand because she is a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down they're so scared of her it's
that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing she wouldn't harm them at all and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children so I think it's a good idea to have them in the past we've had birds too like cockatoos and parrots and the big white birds with the orange crest on top
the cockatoos are those the big ones?
we've had those and those are neat they're messy very messy and loud
are they? a lot louder than a dog a dog you can tell stop barking or whatever
but the birds it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever but they were neat enjoyable animals to have
we've thought about getting an aquarium partly for the cats
I think the cats would really enjoy it with a lid
of course but so far we just and starting up an aquarium we're thinking about getting a saltwater they
and they're so expensive to start up they are and in your the luck of keeping them alive through those first few days
the saltwater fish have so much more color and they're so much more beautiful I know they are
the freshwater tank's just really to me there's most of them really aren't that pretty
I really don't care much for them I don't blame you there I think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than I don't know those fish are just beautiful just so like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something
rather than just little fish but I don't mind having wren my daughter had a little goldfish about a year or two ago
and it finally died and that was neat and they're she can't play with it you can just look at it
you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat and
I wouldn't dare have a goldfish here because it would probably be in a small bowl
and then my cats would knock it over
I have to be real careful about where I put things
if the cats will jump up on things and knock things over all the time
they're always up where they're not supposed to be and that's hard
that's just like kids they know that they're not supposed to do it but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to that's right and they're so independent I love having them for that reason
and until we got the dog it was real easy to go to town for three day weekend or whatever
and now it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone that's right that is hard
and I we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him he's so cute let's take him home
and then the first weekend we had him we were in a two bedroom apartment
and my husband went out of town and left me with the brand new puppy fun
and I had to work twelve hours that day
and so I left the dog locked in the bedroom and I put paper all over the floor when I came home I opened the door and there were chunks of carpet padding everything all over the place
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door I guess you didn't get your deposit back did you?
I had the carpet fixed
I I didn't even tell the apartment manager who got it bless your heart
but that was my first real experience with a puppy when we had our family dog growing up I was eleven or twelve when we first got him
and I wasn't really involved in the paper training and teaching him commands and stuff
so this was to me a whole new experience it is
only it wasn't like cats at all I wish it was I wish they were in that instinct but they don't
our only problem with our schnauzer she's an indoor dog most of the time
and we found she's right at a year and we finally got her house trained and everything her only problem is trash if you do not pick the trash up the container and put it on a table or chair or something she'll knock it over
I don't care how full she is so it's not like she's hungry it's just she wants to get into trouble
my cats do that if I through anything away that's any kind of meat or anything like that
anything that they think is good they'll get into the trash
and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it
and how tight you have the lid down on it
they'll get into it I've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor I hate that
and the cat's just looking at me like sorry you shouldn't have left it there
I couldn't help myself I just hate that when she does that I just and she knows it's wrong you'll walk in the door and she'll cower and go hide under the table
so she knows she does wrong but she continues to do it so
the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's actually not really a puppy anymore he's sixteen months old
but he's still chewing is he?
the last thing he chewed up was when we
why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next
I think I would like something like an economy car that gets really good mileage and one that's really reliable I think probably not a brand new car but maybe something like a nissan sentra or something like that something my husband and of course it has to have air conditioning
air conditioning and a radio a m f m and a cassette player and what else do I want does it have to be a special color?
I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice
a navy blue or a it sounds like something your husband would drive?
that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work I don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air conditioning and a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so
I think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic
we'll probably have to look for another second car sometime and we'd look for about what you're looking for but probably real cheap too it wouldn't be a used car but
I think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed would you like four doors or doesn't really matter
probably that would be a good idea it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes
that's right so if we wanted it to take people out that's a good thought I that hadn't crossed my mind it would be fun just to win one wouldn't it?
I would go for that that would be great I think that's all that we need to say
thank you for calling we'll talk to you later
this is an unusual topic what do you think about it?
at first I it took eight times to find you so I told my husband what should I say and then he reminded me but in his family what they usually do on his dad's side his mom or the aunts will send out little postcards two or three weeks before reminding everyone where to meet and just to bring anything and so they just notify everyone by mail and then they just meet at a park or something to have a small dinner type thing that sounds great ellen how far away do they come from?
they all meet in portland and they come as far as seattle and sometimes we've gone and we were living in utah at the time
and his dad's family is all around the area and his mom's side of the family they all have their family reunions in southern utah and people would come from seattle to there nevada and in that area washington and nevada to southern utah and each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody that makes sense nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once
and the people who are down there they'll assign one person in the utah area one person in the washington area and that person can call beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too
and then they just sort of do a little program or something like that so that everyone's sort of involved that's interesting you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this then
that's my husband's side and my family we all live in southern california so we just have to either or give a formal invite and we're all there so southern california's still pretty large
l a orange county area everyone's mostly not farther than an hour away I see
my experience has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family
years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side and they haven't had a reunion since then they just show up at funerals and weddings
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that
but my mother's side we had our first real reunion that I've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn and they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and a lot of that sort of thing since it was the first one that we'd had you could do that once next time we have one we'll have to think of something more creative to do
that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my husband's mother's side together is they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and inevitably everyone is just very interested and they always have two or three new ones to add to the list someone's been born or someone passed away or something like that
and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever do you have an interest in genealogy?
I do but not very much compared to my mother in law not a passion
I suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy and I suspect we will do more of it I found out about some of the relatives I didn't even know their names some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles
and there's a lot of things there you have to stop they're really kind of fascinating I found out my grandmother was one of a twin
and we don't even know where the twin we have virtually no background on the twin
is it your grandma's own sibling and she my grandmother's sister who would be somewhere in west virginia I'm sure she's dead now because my grandmother died about twenty years ago
I see so I'm probably a lot older than you are
maybe they just moved away and then sort of lost contact I don't know
who is your favorite football team? guess I bet you can't guess
I would say the saints since you got it and I want to tell you something what's that? they're going to go somewhere pretty shortly
I think they are because they're getting better every year and they got a lot can't call them the new orleans ain'ts any more I don't think so
we went to the playoffs
I'm a buffalo bills fan from a long time ago I like them too
so it's good to see the bills doing so well now and they are they are doing a whole bunch better who's their quarterback? what's that? who's their quarterback?
jim kelly I like to watch them too they're the I like to watch almost all the football but of course I watch every saints game that I can watch
but I think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together
if they would just quit blowing it
the it the n f l draft really seems to be doing its job because got teams like buffalo who certainly weren't a powerhouse ten years ago now they've been able to get some good players and come around and new orleans the same story and a few years ago denver was a powerhouse and then they weren't getting the draft picks and now the other team so it seems to be moving around to new orleans benefit
and you see how look at the cowboys they're hurting and really bad
but they got so much bad publicity too and I think that hurt a lot of people even wanting to play on their team
firing tom landry and hiring jimmy johnson what kind of doesn't give you much respect for their team at all any team where the owner would fire tom landry is one of the greatest coaches of all time
and just because they had a couple of bad seasons and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching because all the problems if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of messing with young children
and it was just one thing right after the other with them and he
and had a lot of trouble with injuries too
he'd never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy and then even eric dickerson left the team
you're right people were jumping ship right and left
and I don't know that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem but then the team was sold
so but that jimmy johnson came in too though and he just when he bought the team and all it just seemed like he just decided this is the way it's going to be and it was bad
it really was to me it was like it's going to take them quite a while to rebuild because anything that tom landry wanted or had he was going to change it
it's that's the way I felt about it but I tell you what
if new orleans ever gets a quarterback isn't nobody going to beat us there ain't nobody going to beat us then because look how good we did without a quarterback this year
I know who was the quarterback? they had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it
I can't even think of who the new orleans quarterback is
fourcade was for a while and then I can't remember that guy's name the one that held out for the money and he was across the river I can't think of his name now but really we didn't have a quarterback that was the whole problem
we had one guy that couldn't throw and we had one guy that couldn't run
and it was just bedlam we really didn't have a quarterback it was defense won all the games
were they able to draft anybody this year? I don't know because they gave away a lot of their drafts for different people for other places
so I don't know I hadn't heard whether they have a new one or not
when is the n f l draft but
has the n f l draft even gone yet? not yet but I don't know whether they have one of the first choices of somebody
that would be real good
they've they've everybody gets in draft
but I don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good but
or even making the playoffs so that doesn't help you in the draft but really and truly we just don't have a quarterback
that's all there is to it but the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too
because we had some you remember when archie manning was a quarterback?
that was a few years ago he was good but every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad
and of course we had a different coach then too but they'd treat him bad and then he'd leave or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies
and it was weird it was like they were trying if you were good let's don't have you on our team
but this year they had all good players except for the quarterback
the quarterback all of them every one that they played I think they played I can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks but all of them were bad
they were terrible they could not pitch they couldn't even take handoffs it was terrible
but all the other places our defense was unbelievable it's one thing
buffalo's lucky though to have jim kelly than did you get to watch any of their games?
now he's the number one rated quarterback in the n f l I think
I'm pretty sure he was this past season and then with the defense with bruce smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as problems they had in the past and now they're really playing good together as a team
do you watch it every sunday?
when I can I'm a musician and the band I play in I this is just something on the side and the band I play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on sundays so I missed a lot of sundays during this
did you ever get to watch any of the new orleans games?
I'd have to confess I don't really scope out the new orleans games per se I'm a
new orleans just isn't one of the areas I've lived in so many places I've lived in denver but I don't like the broncos there's no love for the broncos but I've lived in
I was born in buffalo and I lived outside of boston for five years and then my family lives in philadelphia now so I tend to look for teams in your area
and I lived in detroit too so I like first of all first and foremost the bills games I want to see and then I'll normally check out the eagles or the patriots and patriots were so depressing this last year that I kind of gave up on them I know it
but first and foremost the bills I even I got to go to a bills game this year which was fun it was the bills eagles game which appropriately enough fortunately the bills won that's neat
and it was good weather
we beat buffalo in third of december? and it was sunny and forty five degrees
so we couldn't a done much better than that in buffalo because usually it's snowing
ice and rain and everything
but I tell you what if you get to watch some of these I don't know how it will be this year but these games go right down to the wire
it was like I was sitting on the edge of my chair going and one I can't remember it was about it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs or not
so we're watching the game the other team got the ball and we got the ball back that's the way it was and they had to kick to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us
so we had to sit there and they cut the show off and started showing us another football game we did not get to see the end of the game you talk about people calling in
it was wild here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair
and then they changed the game and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another one that was going on
cut us off right there the last few seconds the station finally started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off that it was the national
it was the network because it was funny everybody was furious I was so mad I got up and went and called I couldn't believe that but almost every game that I watched it would come right down to the end we would be ahead but then in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or right ahead of them
and it'd come right down to the end and either we made it or we didn't and it was something else I said this is the most if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the super bowl
there's no question about it because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks and the quarterbacks just didn't do anything
that's the guy that counts but maybe we'll get your guy
I don't think jim kelly is about to be swayed away from the bills any time your family have reunions on a regular basis? probably once every five years
once every five years?
you have got a pretty big family and that is the hardest part about getting the stuff together and everyone is spread out all over timbuktu and you?
we have a pretty big family but most of us I am originally from west virginia
most of the family is right in what they call tri state area northern west virginia eastern ohio southwestern pennsylvania most everybody is right in that area that makes it a lot easier a lot more convenient that is why we only do it once every five or ten years
because it is always that hard to get everyone together
they put one together for our family about once every june it was on my grandmother's birthday but she is gone now that is kind of what happened with ours that is why we have not had one in a long time
so to make one successful what do you all do
do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?
do you all start planning real far ahead of time?
there is kind of a set pattern to it there is so the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually
we get together at the park and playground area of the church I was raised in
and everybody brings lots of food and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat eat a lot
it is a lot harder for us because like I said we are spread out
and so we have to plan really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone can start their vacation time
schedule vacation time and we sunday afternoon or sometimes it has been on a saturday afternoon
usually it is sunday afternoon and most people do not have more than a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back is that one of your
where I am calling from is southern mississippi so my wife and I have a bit longer ways to go than most but you also manage to make them
actually we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago one of the family reunions
but we are both in school so that makes it kind of tough
they have been happening just after the summer semester starts you can't really get away
usually not we managed to get to one that was before I started school and she took that summer off but now that we have been talking about it I am kind of getting home sick now because it has been over three years since I have been home to see my grandparents
my grandfather is the only one that is still around
and my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically
so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it is kind of she was like the glue so
I understand where is home for you? originally I was born in missouri
but we have relatives scattered out all over louisiana mississippi here in texas
but it is harder for everyone to get home
maybe this year you can find a more central location but the majority of them are just like how you said in close quarters so it is easier for us few stragglers to go home
then the majority of them are still in the missouri area
our family right now the most of it there is only a few stragglers with any distance there is one cousin out in colorado some cousins over in phoenix I got a sister over in washington state the rest of them are within a couple hours drive how do you all communicate? to plan it and every thing do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it or do you all mail out stuff?
that is pretty much it it is going to be such and such weekend and you all come
that is about it and this is the standard pattern it everybody brings their favorite dish and somebody brings the volleyball net somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon and I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably over ten years it was don't you remember me and I am no
am I related to you? I know
I married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that do you is that since do you have them every year? every year
and still you wind up meeting people you never knew you were related to let alone
and I think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we don't have them that often
and then when we do and everyone finally does get together it is after the
did you go to college?
I did and where did you go?
I went to a small liberal arts college in virginia
it was sweeper college of about seven hundred and fifty students I had gone to a small school growing up and a lot of my friends went to university of michigan but my parents were retiring in south carolina when I graduated and were looking for a southern school and also u of m seemed overwhelming in size
and what about you? I went to the university of minnesota
you're from the midwest too I am where do you live now?
I live in texas now where are you? I'm in texas I'm in austin
my brother's in austin he lives lakeway he had moved we're in plano and I'm familiar with plano I visited once or twice
austin is so pretty I really like it I love it I love it I really do
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore that's correct I have two daughters but my oldest will be a sophomore
because you live in austin is she thinking about the university of texas? she has her heart set on u t
and having gone to the university of minnesota I know what a big university is like and one thing that I did this summer which I thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band and baylor has a band camp
so she went for a week and it was overnight and they lived in the dorms and I thought this would expose both of them to what it's like on a smaller college campus and my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school so I still think the exposure was good
the reason I ask if you went to college is I thought what were your selection criteria did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision
and those were several that we did consider my parents certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south and because I had been in a small school they suggested that probably I when I say small my graduating class had eighteen in it
and so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one on one or small group situations definitely
and I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology and I also wanted to spend one year studying in europe
I had had an a f s student from germany live with us our senior year how exciting
and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and I ended up majoring in french one of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department they also had a strong language department and I'd always loved working with children and I found that I couldn't fit everything in but because I had had a fair amount of french going in I was able to do my year's study in france and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me
and so that was some of that worked out very well for you but
several of the things you mentioned were the things that our son has talked a lot about texas a and m but he thinks he wants to be a writer and I don't think that then he should come to u t
and really his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand
and so he's used to a bigger size large classes
and because my brother is there he would have family close by so there are advantages but I also because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to university of michigan which was so large and they really felt like they were numbers I went from a large high school to a large university and I definitely felt like I was a number you still
it is a different feeling but that was my only option I just really couldn't look at anything else that was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a junior college which I didn't want to do so that's how my decision was made but
that's certainly especially today with the cost of college that is a major consideration and I do feel fortunate that texas has so many good schools and even though baylor
and when you mentioned that we have friends who have children there who just love it and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and I do feel like there are a lot of options it's but I had been hoping some schools give even this year jay had an aptitude test what does he hopes to be a writer
he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind
does your daughter know what she'd like to do? she has interests that are just going in all directions
what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is bethany let's be real she really is pretty unfocussed at this point and I don't know she's taken a lot of french and she may end up doing something with that and I am a single mom so I've been and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married so I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake and I'm showing them if you're strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money
I'm kind of really putting the practical application and saying yet do something that you enjoy
by all means go get that piece of paper do you just have one son?
I see it sounds like he's got some really good strong ideas of what he wants to do
but he has even now that he's in high school and of course there is still time but he's beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it it's
so this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day so
what do you think is the main pollutants in the air?
I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I think they put off so much and they're not regulated enough that's me too after on channel thirteen they had some programs the day before and I'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and how we're affecting the earth and things by what we do as the people
and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot
and that actually as our population increases and our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem but also like you said the industry pollution and their regulation that's placed on them it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air
I just I can't stand that and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that they're supposed to be regulated because we have a pillsbury plant in a town adjacent to ours
and I know people that work there that of course you wouldn't think pillsbury would put out certain chemicals
but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of what they do to make their dough and to clean out the flour and stuff like that
it's incredible and they said that they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're dumping things that they're not supposed to be dumping
and I'm if they're getting away with it can you imagine
that's a pillsbury plant I can't imagine plants
I wouldn't have thought that pillsbury even had those chemicals would not they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff to break the flours down
and then they also do testing there and I don't when you consider it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be anything that's classified that can damage the earth
so there could be a lot of things that they could put chemical wise that they use to that they are testing with that they're dumping in packaging
and just I don't think they do the packaging at this plant
but they do a lot of research and they do a lot of the refining up there or
I'm not really what's it called when you do flour I'm not
only thing I can think is bleaching but I don't know how they do the flour
but we're on the southwest side of houston we don't have that much as far as aiming in the plants over on this the east side does
we've got imperial sugar and they're right there on the creek also and they've been there for years
and but you think about it it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just I'm not really sure but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down stream or such
or you can do testing on the ground itself at that point
but when they pollute into the air and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off so I don't see how they can do some of the unless it just hangs there in places where it's a lot of pollution in los angeles or the bigger cities where it tends to get stuck there
you know that you have a lot more particles in the air per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away but
I know that I worry every now and then we're still on a well water we're not on city water
and I think what if somebody's dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and it sinked in through the ground and all that I know out in some I'm not sure I can't remember the name of the county it's where stillwater is or sweet
I'm not sure I know it I think it's I know we have a piece property there it's called dublin
it's in dublin texas I'm not really sure what the county it's stephen stephenville
where stephenville's at they've had a lot of problems because they've introduced a lot of dairies there
so they have a lot of cattle in the area they've got per lot they've got a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free
they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and I read in this article where one cow a day produces a hundred or so pounds of manure
one cow I was my god and they and this thing says that people think cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not when you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down
and this article said that they've got a real problem that you've got toxins and bacteria in the manure that is what it's doing is it's going through they don't have a very deep their natural water
I forget what that's called with it's like a spring water
but it's below the surface it's not very far down
and all this stuff is seeping through to the water
and they're afraid that within a certain amount of years that their water in that town will be totally polluted
it will and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have completely polluted so that there's too many toxins and bacterial growth
and the and I'm my god just from them introducing dairy farms in that one county
and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it not when you figure I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure and they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area these are well fed these are you
these are well fed cows they are evidently but evidently a normal cow produces that much too
but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not a problem
but when they get them in these tiny little areas they've got a real big problem and they said that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to these ponds that they had to filter it with
but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow
and they overflow into the creeks and stuff in the area so that just creates there's and it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam
people stand outside their houses and watch the creeks foam brown and all
that's bad and I'm just and the smell is really bad they
I was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad but I don't know it really frightens me though as far as thinking of just air pollution itself and channel thirteen they're really emphasizing the problem with acid rain
if we keep putting that stuff into the air and if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it it's really going to be a problem for the earth what the earth is receiving back because how can you tell where it's going to come down at
and then cutting the trees that bothers me
as far as the the rain forest and all
we've been wanting to not me but it's been suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here I'm no for what's cut down here more will be cut down someplace else and it will just take that longer to grow back
and trees help so that I don't they do because carbon dioxide they use that where we can't synthesize it
and they're synthesizing it for us
believe me it's just so much better
so I knew I think there's lots that could be done to improve how things are done now I think we just have to I don't know personally I suppose if you just make sure your car is working properly
and they're nowadays they have the emission controls on them but I think the main thing is just keep on your legislator's back as far as seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying we're really going to get involved
it's really becoming a problem by the year two thousand there will what are we going to have what kind of results are we going to have for the environment and what will we
do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there?
we've got quite a few actually what we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city the
we've actually had some warnings in raleigh on air pollution you mean for smog and stuff?
because of there so many cars and we have a belt line around raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic
and it's just surrounding the city and you can actually see it there's a couple of tall buildings in raleigh
and you can actually they're blurred they're even dark and what it is is the pollution what do you think of the greenhouse effect that's going on?
I guess that's the fluorocarbons
and that's causing the hole in the ozone
that's very serious we're even feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the jet stream it is scary though isn't it?
the last two years our winters have been absolutely nothing
maybe one snow north carolina that's up there by kentucky isn't it? kentucky?
north carolina is all the way on the east coast
it's further west than georgia it's right below virginia kentucky's next to virginia I'm pretty sure I'm from kentucky I should know but I don't
I'm sorry but kentucky we use to have just real cold cold winters
and we'd have three and four feet of snow course here in texas they don't have snow they don't know what snow is they freak out when there's snow on the ground
originally I'm from texas so amarillo so amarillo?
that's close to here
real close how long have you been in raleigh?
I've been out of texas about ten years how old are you?
twenty seven I almost forgot my age we're the same age
I forget my age all the time so that's okay I think it's just something that goes with the territory
but to me texas and kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school
in texas if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain I swear they close everything down I just laugh
I do they get and traffic slows down to nothing
actually they've been doing the same thing here it's kind of funny I guess northerners are different but even north carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather no I'm from the north that's why I said in kentucky we I don't know you just get used to the weather and of course the people down in south they're not used to cold weather and stuff and it just
I don't know I just laugh every time they have snow on the ground everything's closed up
and you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road that's true but
do you all have much pollution there? not really not to see it of course t I is here oscar mayer
and there is a few factories but I don't see much pollution going on
what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road
and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe they have a test or something like that
and that's supposed to cut down on it
supposedly that's supposed to catch it but I'll tell you what and even these buses it real bad these buses in raleigh school buses and the commercial buses
school buses are notorious they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is and it gets bad
you know what they've started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top
and that way it gets above other cars on the road that's a good idea
and it really does make a difference although it settles even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles and if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's even more miserable I'd have to go out to the country to jog the pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes
I didn't know that when I was pregnant with my first little boy I had read it because I was walking back and forth not back and forth I was walking home from the college I was going to in kentucky
and I was having to walk along the highway it was just one day a week but it was in I have no sense of smell so I couldn't smell this but it would make me sick and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway
that's bad but it's all the exhaust that was four years ago too it's probably a lot worse now I'm sure
you can really feel it in your breathing even normal people and if you're older you can really deplete your oxygen and it'll pass out
and it's killed several people do you smoke?
actually I just smoke one in the evening if that so I'm a very very light smoker it's kind of
it was kind of funny they were doing some ozone testing the e p a and they were just screening some candidates and I don't think I'd ever do that but they asked me if I was a smoker and I didn't fit into the smoker's category and I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category I was just one of those because you do smoke one a day
in between people so that kind of threw them off
but they're doing a lot of research here the e p a for the air pollution
for ozone and all that they're real big into it they've got research triangle park here and they're just doing a lot of stuff but they I don't hear much about it down here course texas we don't have a bunch of pollution
but too we've got that air coming in off the coast
and it'd blow it up north
so maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here
but it would seem like it would be the same way on the california coastline wouldn't it?
I think I would hate to live in california the smog there
I can't believe they have warnings here which it's mainly just when it gets real real hot but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially
that's kind of good to know because I thought I lived in a halfway decent area I think they do that for most everybody
especially it's usually for the young children and older old people
you ought to come to north carolina it's a big change it is?
there was no trees where I was from in amarillo and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees they've got streams rivers ponds
it's really pretty here this is pretty wooded area down here so
is it? in a lot of parts I know texas is supposed to be flat but down by the denison dam there's a lot of sherman and denison do you know my grandparents live in durant? they do?
they live close then
real close I go there in durant oklahoma?
you go where? you go to visit them?
we used to go fishing in lake texoma down by lake texoma there's a bunch of wooded area this but kentucky's beautiful they've got trees and trees are supposed to purify you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff? it's a philodendron
it's supposed to filter the air for you in your home
I'm going to have to get some I had one my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago do you smoke? I do do you? I do
did you smoke when you were pregnant? I did I couldn't make myself quit
I did cut down a lot
I can understand that actually I've got one vice and smoking is it
I don't drink and I try not to cuss and I do very little and smoking I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen
one thing I miss is the people from texas are I miss their morals their values and everything it's we're down here at the bible belt aren't we? I wasn't saved until I got down here and people down here are just there's so many christians and it's so different from kentucky but
how'd you get involved in this research? I worked at t I for a while but then my brother in law works there and he got me into it
I see how'd you get into it?
I was taking a voice I o class and actually doing some research and so they told me about this project it's fun I like talking to new people
and a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl I've had to hang up and stuff
but I enjoy it I talked to people from carolina up in boston and new york
boston is new york isn't it?
boston's above boston massachusetts
but I've talked to people in new york but I've talked to a lot of people in texas I guess it's because t I s down here
I've talked to a lot of people in texas I had one call actually from charlotte north carolina and virginia and I can't remember where all from up north like you said I think one was from boston with boston I love their accent I do I love the boston accent I met a girl from boston one time my husband was in the service so we went from kentucky to louisiana down here to texas
and his family's down here
we're out of the service now
I bet you're glad he got out of his unit right after panama he went to panama when noriega was doing all that and he
so what kind of home repair work have you done?
done a little repair on the shingles on the roof recently we've had a lot of wind around here been pulling them up or just loosening them until the rain came in?
it looks like I'm going to have to get up there again because we may have a leak are you in the section of texas that's been getting so much rain?
we've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around san antonio but I'm right plano's just north of dallas
and there are parts of downtown or near downtown dallas that are under water right now I guess I saw on the news but you're probably about halfway across the state from san antonio though aren't you?
we're north and about eighty to a hundred miles south of the oklahoma line I guess
but you're still getting a good bit of the rain though
we did have a little bit of rain yesterday so far we haven't had any today and I suppose that means I should be getting up there to look at that shingle but I had something else planned today
so I guess I'll let it go awhile is it asphalt shingles or
they're they're wood shake that should be a lot of fun
did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them?
I as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet this we just bought the house last year and just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so I've just recently had to start looking at it myself
so it's a small problem so far but I guess you just have to keep on top of it what kind of roof do you have? we're in campus apartment buildings with flat top
then you don't have to do too much with it not too much they're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs
have you got pretty well pitch on that roof or is it pretty steep?
it's pretty steep parts of it are steeper than others what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal?
you wear shoes with good traction and try to remember where you are at all times I imagine I imagine and remember to yell geronimo if all else fails
that would be just too much of a fall for me have you been was the house reasonably new or you been doing some remodeling work on it it's actually just twelve years old now that's pretty new house yet
it this part of the country actually they say that when the house is fifteen it's already old but just take good care of it
thing is the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some squirming of the foundation we're just on a concrete slab
but the soil right under this is a clay and it it's settling unevenly?
depending on its moisture content it either swells up or shrinks and of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer
and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from drooping
but anytime there's a change in the weather like drastic changes in temperature or in moisture you get little spider web cracks all around windows and doors that sounds like a lot of fun
usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped and then you patch them up what is it stucco walls or
it's all drywall drywall
I think with wood framing?
but somehow or other that does manage to show these little cracks I don't know quite how that works maybe it isn't drywall I don't really know they plastered over drywall
I think it is I remember my parents home is drywalled and then almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look
I expect that's what it is and made for kind of a hard shell on the drywall
I think that's the way this is done fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet so I that's good that would be terribly terribly exasperating to have the slab floor swelling and giving like that
the previous owner had a major problem with it because probably a variety of things his neighbor used
we're supposed to talk about vacations
what kind of vacations do you like? I haven't been to many places but I have a opportunity to go to paris france with my friend in april her family lives there and she's only been there once her grandmother lives there
so I'm praying I get to go
that's great it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go
have you ever been to new mexico? actually why have you? I was curious I was just wondering what it was like
I have been to europe once and to haiti and tahiti? tahiti haiti haiti where is that?
it's in the caribbean and it's the western half of an island with the eastern half that's the dominican republic
and I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries and study the language and then do a little service project
that turned out to be a really good experience for me what did you do when you were in europe?
I went there when I was in high school actually
and I mostly went to germany and visited some friends of my family and hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp what did you do on the farm?
not that much just are you just kind of
I wasn't a great asset to them or anything
but I drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing
and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home and that was pretty interesting and while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were staying for their vacation in france in nantes which is on the west coast right across from england
where in france are you paris paris
and how long do you plan to be going for? two weeks last time she stayed two months but we're only going to stay two weeks
and we're going to take a cooking class there so that might be fun
a what? cooking class french cooking
and what else are you planning to do if anything? museums go to museums and
do you go to museums in europe?
actually I don't think I went to any of them the closest thing I did was go to some restored castles and stuff
there is some on that west coast of france and I went to a vineyard or two in germany that's neat
that was nice so what about have you ever been to hawaii? I haven't have you?
I'm wanting to go there
where have you gone first? where have I gone that's anywhere we're supposed to talk about crime in the city
and seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it?
I that's I think it's statistics obviously vary greatly I always thought of dallas as being a fairly safe place it is but our crimes up here as I think it must be in most cities now but I was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because so many people are without work nowadays economy's so bad
do you really believe that? it's been up every year for many years and the economy hasn't been this bad for so long has it? that's a good point that's just what they quoted over the news
I don't know if I believe that or not but it does seem up and what kind of newspaper do you get down there? what kind?
I think we got a pretty good newspaper we have two the morning news and the times herald
morning news seems to have the largest circulation I think it's a pretty good it's a locally owned paper
the herald is owned by the times out of l a or somewhere but
do they play up the local crime angles or do they they don't not really they don't play it up I don't think but there is too much of it too many homes broken into
we had our fact about last year sometime our home was broken into we
so this is a topic of personal interest we I didn't think ours ever would be burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been and because we live on a corner and back up to a real highly traveled main street but we were so
so you saw this happening in your neighborhood and you figured it wouldn't happen to you sort of and I never did get a security system but since that happened I certainly have
what kind of system do you have? it's just a standard with all the doors and the infrared motion detector pretty standard
is this one with some company that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff? it's monitored and all that and
is that a necessary feature to have somebody at the other end of the line or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise? I think the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice
I really do but this deal that was part of it for three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever
but it the monitoring is not that bad though because we've goofed it up several times you'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something and they call back pretty quickly so I think it's all right but I to answer your question I think that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it
so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system
and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line? it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway supposedly
how does it do that? who knows but that's a selling point and I think it probably does these things supposedly pretty good
they sure advertise so many of them nowadays
but don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there?
I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's down here we seem to or not here but the statistics seem to say that I don't know
I think it's the murder capital of the country now is that right?
I would gather probably from drugs
and I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere
but I don't think there's anyplace used to years ago you thought these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem but they do
we've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it as anyone so what's the solution? that's a good question I don't know I don't know what the solution is I really don't
and all these politicians make hay over being anticrime
but they haven't seemed to have changed anything
and nothing seems to change and I'm not sure that anything will because if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it
but they want to buy it so
supply and demand long as somebody wants to buy it somebody going to provide it for them so I don't know what the solution is I really don't
I don't think anyone does in fact what
how do you view this whole subject?
are you one who feels like you have benefited from the change in roles in women? or what do you think? I I think so
there's been a lot of changes I think there's still a lot to be made though I think so
are you someone who works outside your home or have you I work for t I
have there been significant changes in the employment place especially at t I
has anything in particular changed that you have noticed? during your time there
I guess there's more women in what would be classified as a man's job what kind of work do you do? I am a drafter I am in a man's job
but we have got more women in it now
there's a lot of us in it
in years past in fact even the word drafter has changed
because it used to be they were draftsman
we have some engineers that still on the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman
and I want to scratch it out and put drafter but I thought I am not going to do that maybe not
when I was in college I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty four
and I was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time
so I was in a lot of classes where I was either the only girl or one of just a very few women in the class
so that was a change and even I did not use my math in my work I became a technical writer
but even so there were very very few women in technical writing
but that has changed a lot
in recent years it has just really changed a lot
and I think that the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management but I think they have got a long way to go
there was something on t v the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the chair persons of the board are women in this country
and I thought that that's a pretty significantly small number
so there are some strides to be made there
but I do not know I think we have come a long way actually when I think about when things were like just when I was in high school and how it is now for girls
and I guess my one bad thing is that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because I think she would have succeeded in a lot of ways that women were not able to succeed in her generation do you
do you have children?
I was going to say do you have daughters that's always a good question
do you? in fact I have a daughter who just graduated in civil engineering from college
wonderful although there were some other women in her class she was one of the minorities females in the class
so she definitely entering into a male profession
but for instance there is the organization the society of women engineers
so that is recognized as a place where women should be
but I do not know you see it in church where more and more women are becoming ministers in protestant congregations
and it will be interesting to see if roman catholicism ever recognizes women in the role of priest
I do not know if you are roman catholic or what you know about that
I am not either but that is one area that I can see might change but I really doubt will change
not for a long time anyway probably not
what in particular would you think other than the work place where women still are being found wanting or not as highly regarded as men would be I was just trying to think I know something
maybe you could tell me what you think about this
the role of women in combat roles during the war?
because I know that now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles
and the only branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the air force and I spoke because women were flying missions in the persian gulf war
but I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
it was real interesting I was listening to some of the comments on television the other day about it
and one of the men who was a I do not know if he was a general or what his rank was very high
he said it's just a personal thing with me I can not tell you why I feel this way but I just would rather have a man doing some of these jobs than a woman I thought at least he was honest but that does not sit very well with a lot of folks I am sure
there's some men out there that are more feminine than most women neil as far as I am concerned the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something
because mentally and emotionally I think women can handle a job and every bit as well
I do too so anyway it's still
and if she wanted to go to combat I do not see that they should stop her
I personally would not want to go but I would not either I agree but I am sure that there are women who would relish that kind of job
so I guess that should be taken into consideration as well
this is an interesting topic
I have having a daughter who has gone into engineering I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did
she's a lot more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive than I think I was
so that's progress I guess
I have enjoyed talking with you lisa and have you talked with a lot of people in this project same here or
I am not at home a lot
I am at work right now
I put my work number but at home the recorder gets my calls
usually I am not there
but I probably talked to seven or eight people that's great that's good
I personally have not made any calls yet myself it never crosses my mind
but I enjoy receiving them that's good
that's good because I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls and only because I going to make some money
our choir is doing this as a money raising project
we got the connection through a t I church member
and so we are doing it to raise money for a large project at church
so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful financially painful anyway that's wonderful
it's just real nice that way so I thought I will just get on the stick and do it
that's great I will say good bye to you
but I have enjoyed the conversation
thanks for calling thank you
I guess I enjoy eating out here and there or it's a good change from cooking and eating at home and I guess I like a variety of restaurants
sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal and sometimes I enjoy going out having a formal meal
and sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad something
do you usually go out with the children or without them? a variety I like to go sometimes without them and sometimes it's okay to take them along so
sometimes I think we pay the baby sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches
so it just varies we do a mix sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table
so I guess actually there are times I even say don't sit us next to a table with other children
this is our night out but anyway where do you like to eat?
we don't have any children so we tend to like to try all sorts of different things
and we're very attracted to exotic food
and we like indian food and thai cuisine and sort of gourmet mexican and things like that as well as tex mex and italian and chinese and things of that sort of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too
and we probably go out one to two times a week
and we're pretty much regulars at an local italian restaurant which one do you like?
momo's it's been a long time since we've been in there but it's good there's an italian restaurant over by plano parkway there
is it campari's or something?
I've heard about it I haven't been in there it's good my husband had been in there several times and actually we went in there for lunch one day
and their pastas were great
that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me I like different kinds of food so when we go out I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a mexican restaurant something other than the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas you're brave
and once in a while things backfire we've gone for romanian food and lebanese food and things like that
and I'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try anything
ethiopian we've had ethiopian and not in plano of course I don't think so
but we really do enjoy going out and I'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires even though traditional it can backfire
I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or what attracts us to a restaurant how do you usually find a new restaurant? my husband he's the ethnic fan so he's I don't know you know what we read the d magazine
so do we we check that and the friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there
they often do ratings of restaurants so
we often save those and ventured out on from there just for something that had a high rating
we have found a number of restaurants either through d the friday paper and sometimes the observer which my husband usually picks up and also through coupons
when a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons that's right
and when they say buy one get one free it's hard to resist so we'll go in and very often we'll find a place that we like
and we'll stick with it once they no longer give coupons we'll stay there
but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper reviews
we use the coupons too that's true that's true
it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got four or something like that it's very expensive to go out to eat
that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us I think that that's
sometimes I think going out to eat it's sort of a recreation
just a change of pace from eating at home
so anyway I guess as far as service when we go out it's nice to have someone come and wait the table and clear the table and
and do the dishes and do the dishes and actually it's kind of nice to I always a waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive
we've had experience with that too so
my sister who also lives here in dallas tends to chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty how we
but it may help their tip may not
what's your favorite restaurant? I guess just in plano I like to go to souper salads
chili's is always fine
I guess if we go into dallas we like the routh street cafe
we've never been there you would like it and that's supposed to be wonderful
you'd like it especially it you're adventuresome
we've taken people there several times and they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding I guess it's whether you call it southwestern but we had venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful
and then I guess it must be seasonal and we've been back I guess it's in the winter season they've never had it when we've been back
but you ought to try that it's very good
I would probably like that one or two times in my life I've ever had venison I've loved it but it's just not I don't know people who hunt so
that's supposed to be a wonderful place here in plano we tend to go to momo's fairly often and sometimes we'll go we also go to chili's and colter's bar b q and there is a little thai place that's over on park that we go to my husband particularly likes that we go into dallas a lot because we're both were from the richardson north dallas area up until fairly recently
and we'll go down to blue mesa grill and that's good I've been there
michael what do you think about funding for aids research? do you
that's something I've thought a lot about
I work in a hospital
and I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few aids patients
when they asked us did we want to keep it the same or spend more spend less I think right now what they're spending is adequate for my personal opinion because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a vaccine for
I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with
or I think they already would have by now
so I don't know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now I think they're doing as much research as they can possibly do
and what about you? I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now I'm not either
I'm definitely not aware of how much
that's something I've never really kept up with at all
I'm not sure I go ahead
I know I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research you know what I mean?
and that sort of thing if we were talking about the money I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because I don't know that much about it
I can see that research is needed and definitely
I think so I think so it's becoming a major problem
but I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on preventing it in more
that's true that's true because it's such an easily preventable disease
and I feel like just saying safe sex is not the answer
it's abstinence in certain cases it's definitely not and
that's true that's true and knowing
myself I'm about to get a divorce
and course I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything
but it's sort of scary to find yourself single again
and because you never know what's going to happen you don't know who you're going to come across
course I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see
but it's something you got to think about these days a single person
and it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry
and I think for a lot of people it has certainly
but I know that in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing so that the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything drug addicts
and I don't know I don't think that's a bad idea
I know it sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction
it just sort of keeps that going
but I don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas aids so far can not be
so I don't know I think that's I'm not too much against the passing out of the free syringes myself
I don't know what do you think about that? that's a hard issue it really is it really is
it really is they gave us a hard topic I definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say people in the meantime someone who's not ready to give up drugs that's true
that's true if they're perpetrating the aids problem passing that on to each other then
I guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and aids aids would have to come first as far as something to do about it
so I don't know course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another
so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse which is the most important to solve at the time and I don't know
but I've never looked into how much money they're spending I have no idea
and I know a lot of our tax money goes to that
but I really have never looked into it I have no idea I haven't either I've heard different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough
and mostly that's what I've heard so I don't know
and yet I know it sounds like big money to me
but it probably takes a lot I think it is I think it is it does every
it seems to take more than for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would
but did you have any fear working in the hospital with that
that's one thing I've never really feared
I a lot of my family they fear me working like that and under some of those conditions but I don't fear it at all
I work in the operating room a lot and of course when
what kind of cars are you looking at?
we've test driven the oldsmobile delta eighty eight and a cutlass supreme and a used cadillac about three or four years old because I get married in a couple of weeks
and I have two kids and my fiancee has two kids
so we need a car that's big enough for six
and so two weekends ago we went car shopping and looked around
we found something interesting at crest oldsmobile cadillac up there on central expressway
that in addition to getting a new car there they can get you a car that's new but it's been a demonstrator model for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car so they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that that's a real good deal in fact my dad recently got a pontiac six thousand and he got a demo
and it's been a real good car and it's like new
and it only had very very low mileage on it
and so I think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually
so I think it's a pretty good option
I think so too the oldsmobiles that you're looking at are they the demos or they used are they new
the ones that we were test driving were the new ones there
they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in and then the cadillac is definitely a used car or
the guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes he says it'll probably be gone in a done and it's probably gone by now
those things go fast
of course we can't consider getting a brand new cadillac because those are twenty five to thirty thousand dollars
but when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half
so then it becomes more realistic that's what I'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new
or do I look for a used car that's maybe two three years old but that's low mileage and in good shape
but I kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon or is something wrong with it that's right but I guess that's a risk you have to take that's right
you can reduce that risk by having the car checked out if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this
but if you've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car checked at an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting about how much do they charge to do something like that do you know?
I'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars that's not bad
it'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car to find out I would think so
I would think so it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because I just got mine paid off about a month ago and I
isn't that a good feeling I don't want to think about buying a car for a while I just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and hang on to the one I've got for a few years because it's almost four years old that's right but it's still in great shape I have a mazda r x seven
what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years
and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it I just about could really because I think my car
if I continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value
and if I consider going the used car route and save up some money I shouldn't have too much trouble at all
I would think that's true could you hold on for just a moment?
I'm on a cordless phone and I was picking up some background noise so I just switched the channel up on it I didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record
that's fine but I really enjoy the car I have now and I do want to hold onto it and enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever that's right in fact it never has
that's right and it's been kind of nice and surprisingly enough after four years I'm not tired of the car at all and I want to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while I'm not tired of it and while I'm single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system that's right that's right because one of these days I'll be getting a six seater probably too eventually
the first two cars I ever bought I've bought three cars and I've always bought them new
the first car I kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it
the second car I ever bought I drive to work now that just turned ten years old and I've got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that
so that's kind of in the way I've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
but my car is using two quarts of oil a week now
about a quart every hundred miles
but it runs fine all you it's just very thirsty
if I just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but that's a sign that I'm going to have to do something sooner or later what kind of car is it?
it's a buick century are you going to trade it in on this new one or
my fiance is selling a nineteen seventy eight cutlass supreme that she has it's actually in better condition than my car
and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in
that's probably the best thing you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in or maybe more than that as I've learned
when I bought my r x seven best offer I got for my other car was twenty five hundred I turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred so
there you go you can do much better I'm glad you're taking care of it yourself I think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
that's fact what I think so
I think you're right but strangely enough the best bargaining I had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place I got the best price trade in
interesting but it's a place in arlington and I think maybe as you get outside the dallas area I kind of I bet you it's kind of what I decided maybe because it's outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better prices plus I was going through that t I fleet discount program
did you use it at the car shop place it's before they had that
I had gone over to texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the fleet program
that's right and what you could expect they said a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything
so I figured out a price based on that
that's good but I guess I got a pretty good deal because I went back to the town north mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to get it for in arlington
and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the cruise control
he said you're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me and I went the next morning to arlington and they gave it to me for that price and what's so funny I knew they were going to pull it from town north because that's where the white one was is that right and they had already told me we located one at town north so it was that same car
unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage I got the car off your lot for that price
and you laughed all the way to the bank I did and I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup
that they required you to do and I took it to town north and sure enough I saw that guy and he recognized me
he said dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and I'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day
of course when the place in arlington went and took the car because I told him there's a place in arlington that's going to give it to me for that price
that's right he said they're not
and the next day they pulled the white car and took it to arlington so I'm sure he knew
such a deal I loved it I sat there and I just had the biggest grin on my face I'll bet you did it was kind of nice
dana it's been really interesting I appreciate talking with you good talking to you too don
have a good evening good luck in your car hunting thank you much supposed to talk about boats have you got a boat?
I don't do you? I don't I've had one for quite a few years but I've not had one the last couple of years
but it's something I've always enjoyed do you like boating?
I love them but my children all have been grown for a few years and we were using it less and less and less so we decided to sell it and
I heard that's the second happiest day of your life what's that?
the day you sell your boat I loved having a boat I loved having it
I just heard that that's just a joke I guess
first best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it but I'd like to have one
I just don't know if I'd have the time to use it guy just he needs his weekends free to be able to use it or a day during the week or something
but I guess for the cost of them you don't really it's hard to get I don't know I felt like I got my money's worth out of mine I had bought it used and kept it ten years and got within three hundred dollars when I sold it of what I'd paid for it and had it all those years
so you take care of them they hold their value real well
so you couldn't complain about that
did you go fishing? it was a big boat big ski boat type thing
I had a hundred sixty horse murcruiser in it
inboard outboard I did fish out of it occasionally but I'm not too much of a fisherman
but I did enjoy owning a boat
I like to fish would recommend it to anybody and now sailing I've never been sailing have you been sailing?
I've sailed some I just like fourteen foot sunfish nothing big I've never tried I've always thought I bet that would be more fun but I'd want to be with a skilled sailor but it
they offer classes out at ray hubbard I've always thought I'd like to I've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it
and at this stage of the game I'm not that interested in it anymore
we go out with friends on the we go to the lake just about every weekend down at mount vernon and parents next door neighbors have a big barge
and we go out and take them out on their barge they're getting kind of old and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often so we get out on the water occasionally that's nice
but anyway it's fun I do enjoy the lake but once the children were grown and we'd go down there and I'd get the boat out on saturday and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much it's such a pretty lake down there we'd enjoy it so much and I'd say I'm going to leave the boat out because we'll probably do this again tomorrow it got to where tomorrow the boat was still sitting there and we never did go out again and I'd have to go load it up the next day and
where is that? mount vernon
cypress springs cypress creek springs
that's south of here? it's down at mount vernon
it's probably the prettiest lake in the state of texas
it's just a hundred miles from here
what do you take I thirty five? you go down thirty thirty it's east of here
east of here hundred miles due east of here and
we just moved down here a couple years ago so did you? where did you all move from?
colorado springs did you?
how are you liking it? we love it up there
that's where I grew up
but we like it down here pretty good I think you'll like it better but of course it's hard when you don't have any family around
we got two kids that are under two
and it's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them
it's hard on your folks too I know they're all yours and your wife's folks still live in colorado?
there are supposed to be some people moving down here from colorado springs for t I supposed to be
that's right do you work at t I? I don't
a friend of mine's dad was a program manager up there
and he just moved down here to what do you I guess it's he's working in mckinney I don't either my wife does
but it's a good company but anyway we're supposed to be talking about boats so back to boats
tell me the last time you went for a boat ride
actually I went canoeing down the brazos this weekend that's boating that had to have been fun it was fun it was fun you said you have four cats?
I have four cats how old are they?
they range from about a year and a half to nine years old
I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years I've had him probably five years
you get so attached to them I love my cats I lost one one time
the first one I got he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment
and he'd never been outside by himself outside
and it started raining and I was hysterical I was you would have thought a child had died
I called everyone I knew I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat
I understand and they laughed at me they thought that was so hysterical
I understand we've gone through the same things with ours they've been ill I take off work to take care of my cats my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy
and then we had a baby and it's who comes first the cat or the baby the cat was here first so I know it's hard
and then when we go to sleep at night it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us how funny
it's whose corners is this one that's sweet I have the two the other two cats I have are outdoor cats
and they didn't used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside so I put them outside once I got a house and they're doing great out there they love it but the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there
other than that he gets scared to death if you shut that door he goes into hiding
I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony
that's it and lord knows what happened to him he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares
traumatized for life here
we've all four of ours are house cats are they
we started out with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them
he lived through it I couldn't believe it we went through twenty two hundred dollars worth of vet bills
the cat almost died but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat he loves life now I imagine
and he's thank you so much I wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
I know we wondered about that but that was a traumatic experience for us too I can imagine what did he shoot him with
from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip people are crazy
absolutely nuts but luckily enough we found the cat in time and rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and
he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him
but he's been a wonderful cat I imagine they usually are after something like that happens to them it seems to mellow them or something
but we wouldn't have them I don't see us without pets without cats
they just fill this void I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I can't take care of them as well because they're outside
and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back
and I feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things but I can't give them up
I go hysterical when they don't come home
and you worry about who's taking care of them and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat
and you go crazy thinking it might be yours
I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night I had one we had to put to sleep he got so sick
and I fell in love with this chinchilla persian and brought him home
and my husband just died
it was we can't take it back we've got to keep it now it's here now we have to keep it my first one that I got I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely
so I found this one and actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive thru that said free kittens
and I thought that's interesting I'll call them
and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens
and he was the last one she carried across the whole big sad story
so of course I had to take him I felt so sorry for him after that
and you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers
he I asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so
but he is the lovingest cat people who don't even like cats like him
he never meows he doesn't have any front claws I had him declawed
but he doesn't bite anybody he's just kind of there real friendly and docile
that's good we just love them they get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it's your claws need trimming we call that doing biscuits
it looks like they're kneading bread
it just drives us nuts I just love cats I like dogs they're okay I had a dog when I lived at home
but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually
they really are the cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog they do
but they're so much fun to watch them play they are I love it it's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities
and they just act so funny
we've got the two that were outside they're like brothers I've never seen two cats so close
and they will get to playing chase through the house
and it is hysterical and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit it's like this train a train of cats running around
it sounds like a train we have wooden floors and so it just sort of echoes through the house how funny I can imagine I wouldn't give anything for my cats I love them to death
they're wonderful what are your cats names
we have bonzo bear poindexter and felix how sweet and what do you have I have xanadu and precious and rascal
precious and rascal are brother and sister and they don't look a thing a like nothing precious is a medium hair yellow cat
and rascal is a black and white short hair nothing they don't look a thing a like
not a thing and they came from the same litter and everything
we have tortoise which is a black and orange
and she's so ugly so ugly she's cute
you can't help but love her she's the oldest one but very possessive
it's like nobody messes with her mamma
and it comes bedtime and she's right there is she the oldest one?
she's the oldest and she in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also
and so it's wouldn't have if something happens to her I know it's like the end of the world it will be I know that's how I am about xanadu
you get so attached to them
my mother has dogs and I'm no this is nothing like cats you can walk a dog and that's okay for weekend but cats are good all the time
I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person it wouldn't have worked it wouldn't have that would be a problem
that's one of the requirements I asked him I said you do like cats we don't have you seen those do you ever read cosmo
there was cartoon in cosmo about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him hanging on his clothes they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said of course I love cats and they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards it was so funny
the whole time I was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats are you getting rid of your cats you can't be pregnant and have cats I'm watch me
the child will learn to like cats and deal with them
I'm sorry we are not getting rid of the cats I wouldn't either there'd be no way
the whole family was so disappointed
that's life that's how life goes
but we just love them to death I know I love mine too it's been nice talking to you
it was nice talking to you too I enjoyed it me to
what are your opinions on recycling?
I definitely think that we need to start recycling I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until I think if we wait which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late
I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand I have heard that too
and that is not too far away but I don't know how it is there it is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much I take my paper I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store
and I can take plastic milk cartons or if they have water in them and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile I started saving newspapers and I would take a ton of them
and that's I can't remember where I went to take them but they wouldn't take them
it is real hard to find a spot and then I don't know if you note even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles I know
glass it could be recycled but there is no place to there is no really recycling facilities
we have a pilot program in arlington going on in the north part of the city where they have people separate the trash as they put it out I think that is a good idea
and I think that is what it is going to have to come to where we are just forced to besides a law or whatever that's how it is in new york isn't it
I think so just because they have to and you get ticketed if you don't do it right
and I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's trouble for me to do what I do
I am willing to do it but plus you have to have a place to store all of it
and I live in an apartment
it is very difficult our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers and so I don't know I think there needs to be more places and also I have a real strong opinion in iowa the state I am from I believe it has gone up to a dollar now
every time you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it
and then you take it back to the store and you get it back so that way it kind of forces you to recycle
you are forced to and you also don't see the litter there people just that's true
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and I've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian I don't know if you've tried it I have seen them
and they have on the that they pay five cents and it even shows the states that that take them back
some of them are five some are ten cents I am looking at it right now is texas one of them?
texas is not one of them so I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass I don't think that there is enough being done I work at j c penny at their corporate headquarters
and we have a paper recycling program that is company wide and I do the recycling for that
do they save the paper they use at the office paper
because there is a lot of waste there isn't there and I know there is a lot of computer paper that you can't use
but we use to have I don't even remember the money that they've made from the recycling program they have donated it to charities
they have made a substantial amount of money from it
something else I think we can do is support companies that encourage I have decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton
you add I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but I am going to stick with downey because they were first
and I want them to have my business and I think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic but I know you see some of the stuff and then when they come out with the new things you are why didn't you think of that before
and I think that it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't want to think about it that's true
and I just look at it I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something I want to feel like I at least tried
and I don't know it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it then we will be forced to it may be too late do they not ever burn trash or anything like
very little that's another thing that there were no then that's pollution
I know amway I use a couple of things from amway that it says this is burnable material that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it I know I guess you run into the pollution factor
and then just like the glass bottles that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents but not in texas
and there is no place I can take glass to so I still throw away a lot of glass it is really sad
and then the packaging thing really grips me you buy some and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic what kind of painting are you planning to do?
I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting
and it's a rent house and I decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper so I decided I'm going to paint
and I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint and I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them either that or maybe rag rolling to give it kind of a country look what would be interesting
I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments but they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them
one of the books that I bought where it's describing the sponge painting said you can layer different colors and I've seen that done where there's I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color
and in between there was sort of a rust put on very sparingly
and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco
what I'm trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms
so I want something that's going to tie that together and I'm changing the the fixtures out to make them wood I'm going to put wood in there that should be nice
so it's going to have kind of a country look
and I haven't even decided as far as what kind of paint to buy I don't have an actual instruction book so I'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now
it's going to be a big experiment I was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing
because you might find that it's beyond what you're willing to put into it although I think it could turn out really nice
I've I haven't ever done fancy painting but I sure did my share of just regular painting I've painted several houses inside I never painted the outside inside
what kind of paint do you normally use? we used a latex wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork
my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine trim work where I'd use a small brush and try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
only one of our bathroom has a window in it so I'm hoping that it won't be too much of a problem
I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first because I think I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it
I'm planning on taking it off I have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off
I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago with just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever I would not recommend that method
if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble
that's something that's worthwhile checking into then cause I if it's really old you don't know what it's put on with
it's hard to tell it's the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style
and I know the house was built around the mid fifties
so it may be the original wallpaper could be if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too if it's paper it will probably shred
in one bathroom it's probably paper it's silver and yellow and white
the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black this was in a bathroom too and the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had vivid almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that
that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom it was awful it was absolutely hideous and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a guest went in there and he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations
after looking at all these design magazines and stuff I'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of tie in our comforter with a color that's kind of a burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design
and I'm not really quite sure I don't know if maybe I'm biting off more than I can chew I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale
the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting
it wouldn't be any kind of special effects type thing
it would be just plain paint it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time because if you use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster and with rollers and modern latex paints
you can wash up easily because they're water soluble
and they dry fast so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help
and then if you discover the little tricks and tips about how you get through corners and how you do trim and how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when you pull it up
it peels the paint off when you take it off not if you leave it on for weeks it will do that if you take it up the next day it should be fine you want it to get dry but not just real hard
you don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard that's the problem
it will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long and I was told I always used the nice wide masking tape but I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth because it rips as you pull it off
and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape
and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape but use good stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
I really appreciate all the helpful tips I think you just made my project a lot easier I wish you very good luck with it and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business the last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets and I decided that was too much to tackle I'd hire a professional
if you were closer I'd tell you you could come over and supervise if I were closer I might I hope your project turns out great and I really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting I think that could give it a
we'll see how it goes I may just be flat painting over it of course that's the other advantage of paint if you don't like it all you do is put on another coat
I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up
I need to go to the dentist so it's was nice talking to you kathleen thank you
where was your last vacation?
actually my last vacation was in connecticut we went home to visit family before that we were in hawaii actually I did visit hawaii once but I never made it off of oahu which I've heard is not the nicest of the islands
it wasn't actually it when we were in oahu I couldn't wait to get off
we took a cruise and we went to four different islands and it was a really nice kauai was nice and maui was nice we had a great time
we were there for ten days that's
so where have you been? I've been lots of places my last vacation was actually in morocco I guess that one would count
morocco that was about a year and a half ago and
did you just decide to go there or my husband is french and we were living in france at the time
and we decided that I've never been to africa and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet
and actually it's a fairly common vacation place for french people to go and they speak french so in that sense is just a little bit easier
and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go so we didn't really have enough time
I'm sure it was wonderful we had about a little bit less than two weeks
and as always it seems a bit rushed we do a lot of traveling around we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere
was it hot? in fact some of the days we froze it was
we were there in the winter in january or february I don't remember which
I was born in saudi arabia and when my father worked there they used to travel quite a bit all around in europe and whatnot
but I was very young so I don't remember that and I was three when we moved back here at what age did you
that's too bad because
so I don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
and that was when I was a baby so morocco would be wonderful
because that area of the world would be great it was a very interesting vacation the only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
and there were some places where people
there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off
and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in jacket underneath a coat type of thing but
we found that in jamaica it was the same way that people would come up and try and sell drugs and things like that
but they were so destitute and I guess they make all their money on tourism and they would come up and ask you if you want to buy different things and after awhile it really gets annoying
it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you the worst place was in marrakech
and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities is to hire a local guide
it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you
and it's worth it and it's ten dollars a day or something and it's worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
and you feel stupid doing that but we did it
and we were much happier
and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone
that's great where else have you been? you lived in france
so you've been all through europe actually I haven't been all through europe I haven't been to italy yet
we're going to go for a conference in september and so hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too
my more exciting spots have been I've been to the galapagos islands
that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had
lots of wildlife? if you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation
if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest
but that was really really fabulous and just the photos I have of it and incredible and be so close
when was that when were you there? august eighty eight
and then actually after there I went to hawaii a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
and so I went to hawaii and then to australia and japan and china
did you go on the barrier did you see the great barrier reef and go snorkeling? actually I didn't go diving
I'm a diver and so that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips diving
but I didn't get to the great barrier reef I drove from sidney down to melbourne and over to adelaide
it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the coastline was just incredible it's huge
is it really? australia but
did you have shrimp? I've seen in they show all this wonderful seafood and great big prawns the big shrimp and I don't remember if I had shrimp
didn't have shrimp there? I don't think so
I remember food I like that too but in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car it would have been much more fun to do it in the van with a bunch of people but
you're adventurous you went by yourself
and I was by myself in china too
china was a little bit more of a challenge but it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time
and so I never got out by myself or not much
was it very expensive? actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare but this is from hong kong you're kidding
because I was already in hong kong but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to beijing shanghai chengdu and actually then I took a train up from shanghai to quingdao it's a little sort of getaway retreat village not far from shanghai it's just a train ride
and that I had two internal plane flights and a couple of other things it was really
all for a thousand dollars?
that really surprises me around a thousand
I guess I relate it to japan where things are very expensive aren't they? japan's ridiculous
and I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in they were all completely clean
and they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff
and you don't want to stay in the very very very exclusive because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're
but that was I highly recommend that way to go if you're ever interested in going the route I dealt with this woman her name was rita at china tours in boston
and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to china and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun I think ideally with two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide and then do you have p c s?
I have a personal computer at home it's an a t compatible I don't use it very much any more I used to use it quite a bit
I also have a p c at work that I use as a terminal I do some p c stand alone work on it and I can transfer data back and forth between the p c and the main frame
what about you? do you own a computer? I sort of own a computer we have two p c s at home but neither one do we really own
are you leasing them? both of them are sort of work related and
loaners from work? that's the nicer way
do you work for t I? actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby and my husband's working at bell labs but he's really from france and these computers actually are from france what brand are they? one of them's a compaq
it's a three eighty six
I'm jealous and the other is actually a I b m p c compatible it's a three eighty six I guess it's twenty five three eight six twenty five c maybe I don't know we don't have the we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing and
what kind of consulting do you do? I actually do some work working at m I t and at nist national institute of standards and technology in washington
and then I worked for dragon systems for a while
what kind of work do you do when you're consulting? it depends it's very different in the different places but
is it programming related? program related research related and I work in the speech field and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech
and I do that type of stuff typically for other people and here we use the p c s to do that mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that
word processing more do you know latek? word text processing
I'm not familiar with that
I don't use you can call it word processing but I don't usually use a word processor to do it
and we don't have too much standard software we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
you've got a modem in it then neither one has a modem but we have a modem at home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them? neither one
and so it's an external modem we have
when I got mine I had an internal modem in it
I used it quite a bit when I was looking at information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in fort worth
but went out of town for a while and sort of got off the bulletin board and off of my micro completely
and after a while the modem started making noises on its own even without using it on the computer I could turn a computer on it'd start squawking so I finally opened up the box and took it out that was it
I think that's the thirty second warning I didn't hear it do you hear the beep in the background
that's an ambulance or something going on here I think
where are you I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually and in manhattan
are you at home now? I'm at home
you've got a lot of traffic noise real close it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal because there's a lot of background noise that people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up and often times that I can't do this much later than now between sort of five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call
what time is it now where you are? about twenty after four
so you're an hour ahead of where I am I'm in central time zone
we're eastern and did you ever try using prodigy or any of those systems?
I haven't done that I know someone who has and she's very pleased with it she told me some of the things you can do and it's just a very handy tool to have
and you can do a it makes things very convenient you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if that's what you have in mind I've never tried using that I don't know too much about it what about did you use commercially available software or
I have used lotus I have used word perfect
I not heavy use I've used d base and I've used a substantial amount of shareware I haven't done much lotus work connected with my job I've been through three classes
and I have a great deal of respect for it
I haven't done much word processing work with my job I do some
and I and the d base work I've done was strictly class related I've never used d base but I've heard both good things and bad things about it
it's probably the granddaddy of most data base management systems
it's got some pretty strong competitors some of them have reviews that are better than d base so I think by now it's a matter of personal taste people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use
I can understand that very easily I've had a class on r base and also in paradox
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to d base do you think d base is more flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
I wouldn't say compatible but certainly comparable but
I didn't mean compatible I meant comparable my brain is going to mush
and what do you work on at t I?
I'm a computer programmer on the I b m main frames
I do mainly business data processing
I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility
sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem and that gives me the opportunity to come in to work and fix it if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone
I also handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected
I guess I'll just start by saying that we entertain with a gourmet club here which means that we have eight people four couples
and most of the husbands this is really peculiar most of the husbands cook
the wives during the day get so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day
they don't really care about gourmet stuff but it was the guys that got together and did all this
that's nice and my husband just he really really likes to cook in terms of barbecue and all guys like to barbecue I think it's caveman
I'm telling you but he really does cook and it's a good thing because you can't knock that
but all these other guys do too and so we've gotten together and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals and it's really really kind of a neat thing to do you
how often do you meet? we try because everybody is so active with their kids and all that it's like if we can do it once every six months we're doing well
so we originally started out when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids
then we tried to do it every other month
but lately it's just been once every six months
that's much more reasonable I was involved in a club where we tried to really do gourmet meals
and we were a little bit too frequent I think
I don't remember if we were once a month or anyway it was difficult by the time we went around it was four couples so by the time we got around to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired partly because gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining
it's too rich it is absolutely
and so we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
so we kind of and then one of the couples moved and so we sort of didn't continue it and I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you don't have as much time for regular entertaining but when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be kind of good for everybody and that sometimes means you can't do gourmet because depending on who your guests are
that's true and we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish so he can get within
one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all
so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese
I take that back she can't eat some cream cheese but that really limits it sure
it makes you keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out for something like
so we try to keep all that in mind but otherwise I guess entertaining I guess I have recipes I but that's basically what we do is the gourmet
so they would be pretty elaborate
but it's fun it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff
and you get all prepared
but you're right it's very very rich and I'm glad we don't have it every
because it's quite a treat it really is
sounds wonderful but you like food and I just love the community of food I just think it's neat I do too
I just love sharing meals and whatever you can do to do that
I don't think you have to be more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard the coleslaw and potato salad but
my daughter is graduating sunday and so we're having a few people in sunday afternoon and I did a cop out on to it I'm buying cold cuts
I have to make a cake what are you providing?
and I have to make hors d'oeuvres and I have to make dessert so I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches there you go
so I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on but I can't do it working full time and it's just too much I know we're all not built like martha stewart those people that try to do everything
we all aren't martha stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and time to
wouldn't that be nice? shot a video of the whole thing I don't know
but it's really kind of a neat thing I get a kick out of it I really do everything all parts of the food I love to make things from scratch making breads
and people really pretty much appreciate it
they do it's very difficult to purchase items that are as good as what you can make yourself I think so
in spite of or if you do buy it it's extremely expensive in fact I just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts and I bought turkey and pastrami and barbecued ham at an amish market near here
and I've never been there before and found that there's individual vendors
and the foods are wonderful and one of the vendors had cakes all sorts of wonderful cakes fresh strawberry cheesecake and so on
and it's thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake which is really not such a bad price I decided I just couldn't quite make myself buy it because I do make cheesecake and somehow I didn't want to do that because it there you go
but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful and they had black forest cherry cake and all those things
but those are homemade they are not commercial bakery made and in that they are made in their homes so it's kind of interesting it's out there if you want to pay the price but it is we have bakeries around here that you just gain weight going by the door just like that
just smelling the air but I don't know I guess some of the best things I've ever had some of them were just hors d'oeuvres
doing little hors d'oeuvre things that I have a kick making that
I get off on strange little details of food I guess but we have so much going on here because this is dallas
this is the southwest this is chips and picante sauce and anything hot
you can always make it hotter and lots of stuff like that
so that's a really good party time eating all that hot food
and they just love it down here it just we like hot food too so all the stuff that goes with that so
you don't sound like you're from texas originally though I'm not thank you for noticing I'm from chicago
I thought that there was a slight difference in accent and how I got
and how I got to texas by way of virginia and everything is a long story but I'll bet
do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy or is it always I in fact it just came to mind and this credit cards
I'll tell you what I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I tore mine up
is that right? I know some other people that have done that I got in some financial problems because of credit cards so I basically just got rid of all of them
I have a couple I have a gas card that I use just for gas and one that I use just for emergencies but
we have some friends that did exactly the same thing they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for one they kept for emergencies and they're still paying away to get out of debt I know it
but I did just the opposite I guess I sort of followed in my parents footsteps I have quite a few of them I use them continually
but I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for and I always pay them off totally every month is that right?
that's a good policy
and they're just a convenience for me I don't have to get cash out of the bank and I don't have to be writing checks and
sometimes I wish I had them but in most cases I'm glad I don't because unfortunately I don't have the control you have
I wish I did but I don't
and it I just don't want to get into that situation again so we'll
it's easy you don't have anything transferring just a little signature so what that's it and that's even with my gas card I find that I'll go in to get some gas
and I'll end up buying candy and drinks and sweets and whatever
and then at the end of the month I get a bill and I'm thinking what did I get that costs so much surprising and but the
there are some inherent limits there you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that that's true but I can certainly understand where now I you know
the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really not so much discipline you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but I hate their interest rates so badly that I isn't it that's unbelievable
how let me ask you this how old are you?
I'm thirty three thirty three?
thirty two excuse me you'll be thirty three this year?
you want to be thirty two as long as you can it's coming
I know what you mean about the interest rates it's unbelievable
that just irritates me so much that I refuse to pay them interest and my wife recently decided she had to go to brazil and was going to take off and she's from there and didn't really have the money
but she could pay it off and so I sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards
but she's paying it and I just won't do it she's paying I don't know what per month forty fifty dollars per month in interest
and I just refuse to give it to them
if I need to borrow that kind of money I'll go to the bank and and then you bet
that's in fact I've even heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less rates and have paid off their higher interest rate cards and just sent them back income
and I guess there's some negotiating there too because I heard on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and said what you can do is call if you've got a pretty good credit rating you can call wherever you got your card from and tell them either drop my rates or drop my annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else high
I might and if you've got a pretty good history with them they're more than willing to do that
I might try that because I have one card that I've had for about nine or ten years in fact that's what this guy he wrote a book on it and he says he's tried it with several of his cards
and he's just told them I can get this card from this bank at this rate and yours is at eighteen or nineteen percent
it does not make sense for me to do that and if you won't drop my rates I'll just go ahead and send you back your card and I'll go somewhere else and get it
for me the big thing is the annual fee and I just refuse I won't get any card now I've got a good rating and I've got
and I'm not going to pay an annual fee the only one I actually pay on is this one that the very first
I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight which is movies correct? that is correct
are you a movie buff?
I don't like going to see them in the theaters but outside of that rent a lot watch them on t v mostly I have a v c r and I see most all of mine there what have you seen recently that you enjoyed?
I don't know actually earlier tonight we were watching to live and die in l a have you seen that movie? I haven't
it's kind of one of those psycho ones I live alone consequently I don't like these psycho things
it's not too bad one of those cop thrillers but have you seen the if do you have a v c r?
we do have you seen the movie class action with gene hackman?
I haven't yet I saw it this weekend and it is to me an outstanding movie I thoroughly enjoyed it he is an attorney and his daughter is an attorney and she has a suit against his company it's one of those things
that but there's a lot of it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy he's a good actor though beg your pardon?
gene hackman's a good actor I think he is
do you see hoosiers? I've seen hoosiers saw it just again the other night for
actually we saw her just the other night too did you?
it's one of our favorite movies I live with a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us we've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months have you seen the movie crossing delancy?
that's one I have watched six or eight times I always feel so good when I get through with that movie
I like those movies that you watch time and time again I do too dirty dancing and crossing delancy are two of my favorite what business are you in?
I'm an electrical engineer in new hampshire
I work in massachusetts actually is everything going all right up there?
it's only about half an hour I live on the border that's that bad then half an hour we do that just going to downtown dallas that's right
we live up in tax free new hampshire and drive down to massachusetts to work that makes a lot of sense
but we are you a native of that part of the country?
I grew up in new hampshire it seems southern town it's called portsmouth it's fifteen minutes from the border and five minutes from the main border we live right in the corner
that one little spot in new hampshire we have ten miles of coastline I live on that little ten mile spot sounds wonderful did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
not up where I live but further down the coast in massachusetts they got hit pretty bad I happened to be in nassau and we got the backlash of that thing and they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there and it was quite an experience so what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?
I'm only twenty seven years old so the doors movie that's out on video I want to watch that have you seen green card?
that would be pretty good I haven't seen that one that's a real warm movie it really just turned out nicely so I would recommend that if you have a chance
I'm in for it we rent a lot of movies so we often sit around and say what movies should we rent?
and we don't know if you can get green card go for it
we'll try that one I have been working as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas and I have watched gross anatomy have you seen that one?
I did and I don't know I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical school but I hope you have a very merry christmas you too I'm looking forward to it
I think we're going to have a white christmas up here just like the song says
real problem the last few days one of their young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season it was a catcher
and they really don't have an excess of catchers and it's really kind of late to be trying to trade for somebody especially with the salary cap that the rangers have
they're not the highest paying ball team around
they're not are they but I would gladly take the salary of most of the guys I'll tell you
I would too even the bench warmer I would that's right I really haven't been an active ranger fan in several years I used to go take my son when he was in high school he enjoyed going to baseball games
I'll have to admit I kind of went more to see the other team a lot of times than I did the rangers
but I think they're doing better
I do to I have boys eight and eleven and we go quite often to watch the rangers I can imagine I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid
we're heavy into that too I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch I do too
and I think what caught so many of our attentions last year was that nolan ryan of course of course as a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning he just pitched his first exhibition game a day or so ago
and he pitched five full innings that was almost unheard of for a pitcher to start out that strong
no big deal it's just part of a day's work
I know it he's something else he really is
he really is an as far as predictions and stuff I really think the rangers may come out real strong this year they could do very well they sure could
they because I don't know but last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything
I really do they've got all all their players are signed now some of them are not too happy about it but there's no hold outs
at least that should help that should help
it sure should it should
but in a way I really do and of course there's a few more are good ball teams also
like oakland a's and the giants I really do cincinnati there sure are
I like to go watch the giants when they come to houston some times that's right
but I've never seen the astros play you haven't? I have a few times
they're a good ball team that's right they really are they sure are wouldn't it be something to have a world series between the rangers and the astros
wouldn't it though I tell you that would draw a crowd wouldn't it wouldn't it it sure would
we might actually get to go to a world series that's right wouldn't that be something it sure would
that's something you dream about but there are a lot of ranger fans around
there sure is and they really are incavalia I don't know how familiar you are with him but last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump
but they're saying this year their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and be on top
he's a bull isn't he?
isn't he though he really is
he sure is he either hits home run or strike out that's right there is not ever a in between for him that's right it's kind of like babe ruth
they were saying something about this may be his last year with the rangers though apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year and they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again
to sign him again that may or may not happen
you never know that's right it's a long way away
that's sure if you offer them money I'm sure they'll do a little bit of everything that's right that's right unfortunately the rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do
like that joe hosago that's right
is there going to be a ticket increase this year price do you know I hadn't heard I haven't either
I really haven't those cowboys have increased their prices again this year
but I didn't know I don't think I've heard anything on the rangers or I don't remember it if I have I hadn't either
we hadn't like I said we I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet I guess it's too early
because we usually get one we usually order our tickets way in advance it's a good idea
we try to go so often if you have young children they get a kick out of it they do
I've enjoyed talking to you you too lori
and hopefully we'll get to talk again you take care
I think that plano has really done a fantastic job at least their plans are good however I was
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that they've had some problems with the recycling on plastic
with the plastic I thought that was most interesting
I thought it was sad that it started out as a good program but then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there
and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump that's right
and it's too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing I guess that's going to happen
a really good effort that's right
but I was thinking about the other day many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in missouri I went this was probably it have been nineteen sixty seven or sixty eight I went to a meeting and one of the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling and she was from saint louis
and she had this fantastic family effort in recycling and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum
and I thought one person is doing that but my thought was it's a shame it's wonderful that she's doing it and it but wouldn't it be much nicer if we all did it because her effort would have really really been a good example for all of us and we were just sort of talking about it at the time and here we are now we're doing it on a city wide basis in communities
doing it so it's wonderful that we've come that far I think but
what did she do with if she was she a group that was doing it or was she doing it on her own and what did she do with the I think she was
I was trying to remember it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in saint louis there were places where she could actually take her things herself
and so it wasn't something that was being picked up and I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would but I remember her saying I have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing and I thought that is wonderful that somebody does that
you have to really want to do it though
this is even what you recycle because we do the plastics and the aluminum and the glass and the paper
and of course then you try to buy right too but a lot of our neighbors say you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that and you have to sure you do
we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans isn't that amazing?
and I thought what are you complaining about when you're only going to get picked up once a month or once a week and people I don't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort
rather than work with it
I don't know it's I know what you're saying kind of people like that and it is
it's for everybody's benefit
it's not so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime but you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren
and what kind of quality of life are you leaving them? it's on down the line
and I have a real concern about that I agree when
we've never had much trash because while I was raised in a big family and gene's family wasn't big
but they weren't rich
and they had to recycle
and the they didn't they just used things they didn't throw things away before they were used up
and I know I guess I got a good example from my mother because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things and she is to this day and she'll even
if she for instance she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for when she made cookies it would go on that or if she needed sandwich paper or something she'd use that
she recycles everything and I have done the same thing I recycle zip lock bags and things like that
my kids get the biggest kick out of that although they do the same thing I think they give me a hard time
but I think they know that it's the right way they've picked up the
they do and when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things then they say mom used to do this and dad used to do that
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that that's right
and pretty soon they're figuring out that's not such a bad way to go but that's true
I don't know I wonder how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to make this whole thing work the extra washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually making sure that you take stuff over to some people now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside
and I think you just do your part people are not you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always work out
this is what concerns me you over in europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here that's right
you've got to be in a country even in mexico you don't see things thrown away like we do here
what we throw away is a king's ransom to most people
and I and even to people in our country who scavenge for food
and I think you have to get into a period of need
you can't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful
this is why I thought jimmy carter was never very
people didn't like him
because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that
do those little things
and nobody wanted to hear it that make a lot of difference
I and I think you're right though it's I think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes
or you have to grow up with it being important in your life before the message really takes hold sometimes
and I don't know it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am even myself than I used to be a few years ago
I'd go to the u t d cafeteria for lunch sometimes
and they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't need to use styrofoam plates
and I think to myself that's crazy I wonder if maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention
and I'm seeing more and more of that and I think it's just mcdonald's effort to reduce the number of styrofoam boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff
I think is a good example that even industry is willing to do it
I think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled
I think that's kind of what it's coming to I'm sure
that's right and do we have to wait until all the landfills are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage that's right
and I don't with the mind set of the american public I think what they will do is start paying mexico to take our trash that isn't harmful
that wouldn't surprise me
or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean I know it that's the way we solve problems and unfortunately and it's sad
this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend are you really? where is it going to be? down at lake texoma lodge
this is one that's the baker family reunion
and this has been going on at least twenty five years or thirty something like that that's marvelous maybe longer than that I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime
first time I married into the family and the first time I went was about fifty seven I think
but this one has been well organized and in fact it used to be at lake brownwood and now it's lake texoma because that's more central location for people from oklahoma and texas to come to
I'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be very important because you'll start losing people if it's too far to go
we have factions when it's one part I have one reunion on my mother's side and we found that if it's in a certain part of texas some people come and if it's elsewhere other people come we never get them at both of them never get them at both places
it seems like so I think we need to find a new place listen they've had this one it just of course over the years it has built up as far as the organization is concerned
but now they have a golf tournament on the saturday
and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such
that's a neat idea and they get the community building there at lake texoma lodge and everyone brings in food
and then for the saturday night dinner they bring in kentucky fried chicken from durant and it really has worked out
how many people jim are involved? generally I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people
I think normal's about sixty or seventy
I guess ours probably isn't that big our family is dwindling for one thing
and I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died
I just have one aunt and my family so sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids
and we're kind of off on the sidelines but it does remind us that we have family and roots
so we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it our family reunion started out my wife and I were the kids the newlyweds
and now we go our children go and our grandchildren are going now
that's great so it's wound up that we're the old folks now
but they have various organized they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes to pitch and they organize a baseball game for the kids
and several people bring boats and there's a place they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon so it's a full day so there's lots to do some of the people come down on friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend
and some just come in for saturday
so it has worked out quite well and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year
that's true that's neat I think they're really fun we go to mine regularly and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in temple and he has a large family so it's fun when we go to that one my side of the family is from back in ohio and west virginia and I think we've been to one in thirty five years or something like that so that's just too far away
that is a problem with the distance the people that we have that don't come are out el paso way and it's just too much for all of them all of that group to travel it's an all day drive just to get to this area
but then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out
they're going to have it at fort davis
and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion
we have each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion
and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together and it takes a lot of planning and assembling of stuff and choose some place that everybody's going to like as far as food and all that that's correct
that's a heavy burden it is I tell you I don't really care for her to be president again
but that is it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun
we've enjoyed it and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from oklahoma I think
and it's good for kids to know that they have other family and this year they're all excited the show this weekend this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show
my two grandsons and one of their cousins are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song in jeans and t shirts and such what fun
so it's going to be exciting for them and for us too
probably lots of laughs
there have been some really wild shows put on there they really get into it
it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along ours is still kind of loosely organized and the same people usually get stuck with doing it that generally happens and they do it as a labor of love
so the officer idea is a good idea we've had various things over the years to raise funds for it
and again it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such
but they've come up with
they've tried passing the hat and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds and some people do
and some people don't
and it's not fair that everybody not contribute excuse me but that's the family reunion story
a lot I enjoyed talking to you been nice talking to you
my t v down I'm sorry
invasions of privacy
what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things
all sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing
I hate those canned messages they put on my recorder
my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen just what went into the something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers
I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using and businesses would be prohibited from calling for business selling you things I have through the phone company I'm sure that's true no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received
some of did too I think government can do that now is that right?
and especially with possibly children around
that could be useful protection and I don't have children around but I just don't like those nine hundred numbers so I've excluded those
so I used to deal with but it does not stop you from the dialing services
what are dialing services? where they intend to sell you things
where people just call you and leave again that canned message on the
and then those problems has been eliminated those problems used to be when I used a credit card they'd want to have my phone number
and I did not like giving it out I gave out my work number
but I think I'm not sure if it's by law just otherwise I think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number that's the thing I hated too about radio shack
how did radio shack work? if you go in and buy anything they want your phone number and I don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning and I don't give that out I have an unlisted number so I don't
that's one solution but you nonetheless often get people calling you?
despite the fact that your number is unlisted?
and you actually have your number or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours? anything that you buy you may get put on a preferred list that is purchased
and companies can purchase this list and what that is is people who buy from the mail
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers
I'll be thinking in mind the address is is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number?
some of that unfortunately is legal so they can't stop people from advertising and that's what it falls under it falls under the guise of advertising so I don't care for it but is it a legal solution for some companies so that's the way things are
I don't know I think it's gotten much worse the last few years
maybe that's just because I've gotten on more lists they the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy you've got the holy rollers and you've got all kinds of people knocking on your door and who want to either direct you to the right path or want to sell you paper routes whatever so it's not just the telephone sell you magazines
I guess whatever is I just don't give our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive where do you live? I live in san antonio san antonio
I live in garland and we're just beginning to we just built a real big recycling center that recycles everything imaginable
but as far as trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing they're testing that
so they're really not full force into it but they're trying so we're attempting it but I wish we could do more there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in san antonio I used to work for the power company here and there was discussion for a while about building a garbage burning electric generation plant
but it just wasn't cost effective at the time
and there's little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there isn't any advertising campaign there's just not any push to recycle
I recycle my newspapers and my aluminum stuff
that's what I do but they make it as hard as possible it's not very convenient to do
when they put centers and stuff like that
we have those which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans I don't know if you all have those things around
and I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center and you can just stop by everything else like the paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but for aluminum that's real nice
and I started doing that at work I put out a trash can for people to put their aluminum cans in
and that's really helped a lot everybody's pitched in and it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can
so I really like that but people are really concerned it's just that sometimes it's not the right people which is really really sad because I wish we would do more
at work we started all the recycling stuff they're really trying I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year
and that really started a lot of stuff off but sometimes it dwindles down where I work now we recycle all the computer paper that's good but that's about the extent of it
that's at least you're trying something
it's just it would be nice if it could be more and I'm sure that the driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so
do you really we sell the paper back to a paper manufacturing company
that's a neat idea it defrays the cost of buying the paper I think I not by much but it does defray it some
enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building
that's really good at least they're trying
I know a lot of companies that waste so much that I'm even trying that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building and the nice cardboard boxes that you move packing boxes and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster
and I thought I don't understand this
we're trying to cut cost and everything like that and recycle and all that stuff and here we are wasting and I don't understand sometimes the logic behind it the last time someone moved offices in my building and the properties people came in with the good cardboard boxes and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around
I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon and they're good boxes that's exactly what I did and they were just going to throw them away
exactly what I did exactly
because I didn't want to waste that
and it's hard enough to find good packing boxes and these boxes are you can unfold them
so they don't take up much storage space
that's very good I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away so
I thought I was doing them a favor by taking them
I found about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes that were in the dumpsters
so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes when these are perfect
so the ones at the grocery store half the time they've pulled the lid off so you can't use it anyway
those and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away
and I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes that's exactly what I do those are perfect boxes to put files in
they're good for storage and stuff like that that's what I do with a lot of my daughter's things is I'll store her out dated or out of season clothes in them and they're just perfect what I've done in the past I don't have any now but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids
and you can stack them up and leave them out and put things in them even
and they look just as good that's a smart idea
I think I'll have to try that that's really cute it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever
they're the exact same thing that's all they are they just made them look fancy you saved me some money
and you're recycling
that's neat do you all have we have places that pay for paper to recycle I know you do yours at work but for newspaper
but ours are real hard to find that's the one thing that really discourages me I recycle paper but they it's almost like they don't want the paper because they don't pay at all
they're real hard to find the places that pay and that's really discouraging I just go ahead and take it to the regular place where they just accept it
but I think they should if they want people to recycle I think it's the aluminum it gets people to doing it you don't have to pay them a lot I live near a walmart and there's a big huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front in fact I think there's two of them that have several openings
and it's for recycling and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category
I don't maybe there's two for aluminum and you don't get paid but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there that's good
I the one thing I don't like about the newspaper also is at work we have two different trash cans at your desk you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash
but in the paper one you have to separate you have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper like magazines
you can't throw any of that away and you can't throw certain file type things away and I just think it's such a hassle it seems like it would be easy to take it all I don't know of course I don't know all that about recycling so it probably is a hassle
but I do get tired of having to separate paper it gets to be I guess you have to make it a habit you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit
and we had a write up in our paper this last time at work about they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash
and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had dumped all the trash in the same bin
and when they were questioned about it they said we're running late or we didn't have time to do those bins or something and that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting there working to separate it and then they and someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags
so they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those talking to the people again about separate them because that is discouraging when you do that it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans
but luckily that will all get straightened out and they'll start separating them because I don't mind doing that I feel like I'm doing something for the community when I'm doing that
but anyway I've enjoyed talking to you you too I thank you
what kind of car are you thinking about getting?
none at the moment when you decide to
I currently drive a ford taurus
and I would imagine that if I change or if I get another car a new car I will go with the taurus or something similar in that regard so you like the ford?
I have had it for about two years now
and it's everything it's supposed to be I haven't had a minute's trouble with it
and the only thing I have against it in that's it's a taurus even after two years I still feel uncomfortable driving it because I had a honda before that
and so it's a little bit larger
but that's the only difference that I see really but I would my criteria at the moment it would be american personally it's the this the car I had before this one was a thunderbird as a matter of fact
and I loved it I really did but I finally decided to go check out what the foreign cars were so I bought myself a nissan a two forty s x
but even though I love the car I've got now I think my next car will probably be american again because if I can at all do it I'd like to stay american
I always have up until now I just for one time decided to go outside so
my wife still has a honda accord
and it's an excellent automobile but price and so forth
I'm not a real car fan I do not opt for something that would be expensive
I want something that's serviceable something that I can use
and I and with the taurus I have a taurus l x and it's you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable honda or nissan or something along those lines
and as I said as far I'm concerned it has been extremely serviceable and everything I wanted ford's done a real good job in the last ten years or at least the last five to six years of really turning around their quality I think
I think so too I in travel and renting automobiles in
I've driven chevrolet automobiles and dodge and I if it's chevrolet I just will not touch it
I had a chevrolet before I bought my taurus I purchased a chevy citation those were not good cars
and I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it
so I shopped around and if I had thought I wanted to pay the amount of money I probably would have gone with an accord or even a civic or something comparable from nissan or toyota
but it was just I have a friend who has an auto shop and he purchased one of the first sables that was manufactured for his wife a sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for comparably equipped
it was just there was no comparison the only thing that I find if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft american ride
not that's about the only thing I find disadvantageous to it but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable and I drive around a lot and it's very comfortable on the highway I can drive for ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way
but those are my criteria and I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if there's something out there that is comparable to what I have now I'll go ahead and get it the only thing I'm looking at right now
I just bought the nissan that I've got about nine months ago the only thing that would get me to change cars right now would be if at the moment I'm single and if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it but I don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking
cars are too expensive right now to even think about buying new cars every couple of years I it's
in our parking lots two or three days ago I saw one of the new honda sports cars
I can't remember what the name is it's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is and it resembled a mazaratti very very closely
and it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth
but to pay that much money for an automobile is just I can't conceive of doing that that's I went to a car show down here about two weeks ago and of course they had the ford the chevrolet that stuff but then you started looking at the they had ferrari there they had b m w and all these other kinds of cars and ferrari didn't even let you near the car they were that's how expensive they were
and then you saw hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and even though I do enjoy cars I can't see paying more for a car than I would for a house
that's true that doesn't seem likely
the difference there too is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving
I never have been since my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen
so I've never really cared what I was before I was married and before I went to graduate school I used to do little sports car racing it was never my own car
it was always someone else's and that sort of thing I enjoy but to go out and drive never has really had any appeal to me in that regard
I guess we've discussed that enough don't you think I think so
we won't get the recorder or the system to shut us off tonight that's happened to me almost every time I've that's happened to me once
it's very easy when you get on a topic that you enjoy I think the one time I did it was on the mid east the crisis out there
that had a great conversation but then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more so
I was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and we were cut off we were told to quit
you have a pleasant evening you too take care
what sort of camping do you like to do the most?
I do real rough type camping I have a motor home rough type?
motor homes can be a lot of fun they really are
they really are I've enjoyed it I've never actually done any tent camping but one of these days I'm going to try that too to go visit the national parks and state parks and just get out and see nature that can be a lot of fun too
how about you? so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping
this summer we went to the smokey mountain national park and stayed about three or four days in there
how great it was wonderful
nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable
and the days were nice and warm and it was beautiful beautiful few days
that's great it worked out particularly well especially considering she was six months pregnant so I don't know
it worked pretty well it was one of those dome type pop up tents
nice and quick and easy to put up
packs away nice and small and about had to be something like that getting around in a pinto
that's true that's true it was a lot of fun
I guess the last real camping trip I took has been a couple years ago
I went to california up to the sequoias that's got to be beautiful territory
it's gorgeous I love the big trees just the drive up the coast line and then cut over into the parks it's gorgeous though
what sequoia national park?
I had been there before when I lived in california but that's my first trip back in thirty years maybe
but that is god's country it has to be
do they still have the scenic roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees?
they don't they the last one the first time I was there the tree was still standing but it has since come down
but they are huge if you've never seen them it's very awe inspiring so far new orleans is far west as I've gotten new orleans and minneapolis
there is lots of pretty country further west
we're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way
and you just need to take the little one show them all the pretties before they go away
they seem to be trailing out quickly
because there is lots to see there is course the grand canyon and the painted desert is real pretty in a different sort of way
and course the sequoias and the redwoods and you get up into bryce canyon and yellowstone and the grand tetons are gorgeous too I imagine
I would imagine they are
course I guess I'm partial to big tree country I don't know why I got stuck down here in texas now
I think it's called a job I don't know not a whole lot of forestry down there is there? not around here
not around here place is forested with those concrete trees
lot of concrete and glass
I guess that's god's place too anyway what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?
probably the last one that I went to california I took three weeks three weeks
and I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks the whole family then was in on this? everybody
that would have to be a blast
it really was it was great what you went out from texas up into that area?
we took the southern route and went through the grand canyon again and we stopped at las vegas for a couple of nights and then went into malibu in california over on the coast
and then we went up the big sur highway all the way up to san francisco and then cut across through the wine country and then went down to sequoia national park
big sur highway that's where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you?
it's not often you get many women interested in football do you follow football very much? I'm sorry what?
do you follow football very much? I don't I haven't recently
we can talk about something else do you have any you married? I'm not
I guess kids are out what's that? kids are out are you married?
I'm married got two boys
do you like football?
I follow the cowboys but that's about it the same here
do you live in dallas?
I am a pretty big dallas fan been for a long time
but I haven't been to any games recently but I try to catch the game every weekend that I can
have you ever been to a cowboy's game? I haven't
it's pretty nice we decided just to watch them at home but
that's good at least you follow the game a little bit
I'm not a fanatic about it I don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are I just like to watch and hopefully they win
that's about the extent of it right now I'm in college so I'm more into college football than professional I think
I see what school are you going to? I'm at b y u b y u so leslie what are you studying? nursing nursing my mom's an l v n
what are you planning to go into? do you want to be an r n or I haven't really picked a field I've thought a lot about labor and delivery but I don't know
try that that's what my mom does labor and delivery
she loves it she really enjoys is she a nurse in dallas?
she's a nurse in san antonio
but she's been working on a late shift she works I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it
she works the graveyard shift and she's worked that for years when I was small
I guess probably going on twenty years now
and she really enjoys it she likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night and she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives
and she's really enjoying herself she really likes it that's great
good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree hope you'll like it
do you plan on staying in the dallas area? I'd like to come back to dallas right now I'm in utah of course
so but my family's there so I'd like to go back
I think texas san antonio in particular has got a large base of hospitals I don't know about dallas I think dallas is pretty scattered are you in san antonio? I'm in dallas
but I'm originally from san antonio
and they've got large medical center down there they've got the u t health science center out there also
so if ever wanted pursue anything more than your nursing degree that'd be the place to do it my brother in law is in the medical profession he's at medical school in san antonio right now
like I said good luck to you
take care and maybe we'll meet up again some time
I think we're supposed to discuss our view of the soviet union as a continuing threat to the united states
how do you feel about that
I don't really I more I don't know about the government as much as the people I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all and I really don't feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore I'm worried about them they're in a very tumultuous state right now with the kinds of adaptations that they're attempting to go through I'm concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden they're very large
and they can become very quickly a large financial burden as one more stepchild we have to carry around
I think that's a real important aspect and that as the let's see the more that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a reality I know that this last winter was very hard on several areas in the ukraine particularly the coal mining regions of siberia the people there have money that's not their problem but there's no food for them to buy and it's you can't eat money and they have a problem their whole attitude I'm not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it
and the people in the city were saying why should I go do that make the government do that that's not my job
they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now and they've been under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms but they don't know how to act yet they don't understand that to make that work they've got to take some responsibility for themselves it's not just the government's responsibility anymore you can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well and I think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back people only go forward and I think that that is giving them I'm expecting a call and unfortunately I think it's come through I've enjoyed talking to you thank you
there we are tell me about the car that you've got
I have a honda hatchback nineteen eighty four
and I had a hatchback a nineteen seventy eight version before this one
and I'll be honest with you I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and put together and it does its job all I have to do on my honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty five hundred miles and I did have to put two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles but that car just purrs like the day it was built I get forty two miles per gallon on the highway and twenty eight to thirty driving around in town it's a five speed straight stick machine
and I can carry more in that trunk area in my little honda than I can in the big cars and I have a large pontiac and I have a sixty nine cougar which I'm saving because it's old but it's in beautiful shape
but I can carry as much in my honda or more than I can in those other bigger cars that's very interesting I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got and surprisingly it's also an eighty four and
l x? I'm still here I'm sorry what?
it was an l x? it's an l x it's not a hatchback but it's
yours is a four door four door
and very very comfortable car big roomy trunk
and very happy with it and I must admit it's if my only consideration were buying another car just to tool around town in and make brief trips and things like that I would very very seriously consider buying one I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars
they are my real concern with why I'm not sure I want to buy a honda is because I have to make a kind of a steady trip down the road about once a month because I'm divorced and I have a daughter that lives down in north carolina
and I drive down interstate ninety five and it's just an absolutely wild highway
ninety five is wild in any car there's no doubt about that and
because I run over to crystal city or used to I'm retiring the end of this month
but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there and you've got it so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine it's very hard for me to imagine that a honda's going to be as safe a car as the one that I've got my eye on which is a volvo
in fact quite frankly I've owned a volvo in the past and I've
they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service but I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that need to be taken care of and so forth and I guess that's one thing that recommends the honda to a lot of people is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood and
it just sits there and purrs and all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas I know it's really amazing it's
beautiful beautiful machine
incredible anyway I've been looking at the prices of these cars and so forth and I think that it's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own is that right and
a brand new volvo costs thirty thousand dollars? certainly some of the top end ones you can still get even the low end wagons for less than twenty thousand dollars
and we get in the washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of volvo dealerships down here
so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any week and I sort of scan the paper and look at them and so forth and that's the other thing is that I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person
I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life and I've tended to buy cars that are two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old this honda that I have I bought used and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it I've just rolled seventy thousand miles and it's an eighty four so
my eighty four just has seventy seven on it and I've made many trips to washington and down to virginia beach virginia where my mother lives and things like that and I drive it
what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day?
I don't like it when people listen to my phone conversations like if they're outside my door while I'm talking in my room or when people look through my things in my bedroom
that's right that is really an invasion of privacy
I find it very annoying when I've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly the solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and
does that happen in your part of the country? I come home definitely and I am trying to get a few things done and I can't do anything but answer the telephone
some evenings are worse than others but I wish I could put a stop to it but I don't know what to do to stop it
even we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting and they would still come to our door and knock and they would think it didn't mean them I guess
I guess not everybody but me
do you live at home with your parents?
so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family mostly
what can you do to stop that? I don't know
I am used to it now but sometimes it sort of gets to me but there is not much I can really do
just have to live with it I guess
try to remember to respect their privacy and maybe they will respect yours and I don't know I always do you have brothers?
I do but they don't live at home I was I had two younger brothers and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations and
I used to do that though because I was the youngest I would pick up the phone and listen to theirs but I I would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me and then they would go get on the other extension
and I could hear them but I couldn't get them to hang up but I stopped doing that a long time ago
and they still do it to me even in the office I find that people walk up and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up
this lady does that to me at work when I'm taking an order or something
and she'll just sit there and listen like I'm doing something wrong and she just started and she is nice but but it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do but let's see I can't think of anything else I'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors
about the only thing that really bothers me I don't have that many people coming to my door
occasionally we'll have a person here or there but not as many as the phone calls
but and I guess that's really the thing that really bugs me the most I can't think our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me but they've all gotten grown up now
and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up
but what else would be an annoyance? I guess traffic could be an annoyance
especially when you're in a hurry do you have a lot of traffic in your area?
it can get busy usually in the week I'm some days it's real real bad here and you would like to feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you but
I've traveled quiet a bit and I've been through dallas texas it's pretty busy it really is and pretty noisy it really is
I live right on a main thoroughfare so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy because at first you'd hear a lot of noise especially at night when you go to bed
and every time a fire truck or anything went down the road I would wake up but I guess I have gotten used to it because I don't even hear it anymore
I suppose you do and I just close it out I guess because I don't remember waking up in several years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by
I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me
I am a real solid sleeper though so that probably wouldn't bother me I'd sleep right through it they would have to chop down the door and get you out I guess
it takes a lot let's see what else is an invasion?
I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time
I was mad because those were mine did you have has name all over them?
it was a letter from a girlfriend of mine I was upset because those were mine and I thought he that was yours
I thought he would respect me more than that to look through my things and not trust me
so that was upsetting I was mad about that and my privacy there
my favorite show is masterpiece theatre and it has been for a long time but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it do you by any chance? you do
very much wouldn't you know
as a matter of fact I prefer public television
and I particularly enjoy the english comedies and the english mysteries
I watch mysteries too is that what you're referring to?
that is good I like do you read?
vociferously that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books
and the plots are more challenging than the sitcoms of regular t v
unfortunately for us at least here in the united states the only access we have to that of course is public television
I'm not a great television watcher in any respect but the watching what I do watch is usually news and whatever is on public television any kind of I also am very fond of great performances in that regard me too
but did you stay up late and catch this red dwarf? that was a scream
as a matter of fact turner broadcasting has been broadcasting all of the james bond movies every night this week so I have concentrated on watching james bond movies this week I used to like him too he was my hero in fact I like sean connery to this day
they're showing live and let die at this moment
and it is the first appearance of roger moore as double oh seven he can never cut it
that's true I was just thinking that today he did well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies he does
whereas sean connery has maintained the ruddy look but I liked his accent too
and he can even be in movies that are not sexually oriented and he still comes off great
last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something he is
he had my vote double
the man is sixty two years old I don't care
but otherwise we with p b s and so forth and I particularly enjoy the series yes minister? what's that about?
that was about the interior minister it was a comedy
the interior minister in england with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that
I've seen it several times it's a scream but I have to go to bed I have to get up and work the next morning I wish they'd put those that's why I say did you stay up late to watch this red dwarf it came on after doctor who on saturday nights here at least
and it should of course I really it was I don't think they should show it during prime time but still it was funny
I know I'm not much of a television watcher I read as I said quite a bit
I read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff
what do you do? what kind of work do you do? I'm a payroll clerk just an accounting clerk
at t I? I have a friend who works for t I and I work for a tire service here in
I see I'm from dallas
the last two people who have called both worked for t I and I just wondered it could be t I ers probably are participating more than anybody else but I needed the money this is five bucks here
I think that's something we all do you work for t I?
I work for g t e in maryland
how did you hear we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we? I guess not
how did I hear about it? I work they are gathering a data base for voice processing
and that's my field of work also
so I know the people at t I who are doing this and I heard about it so I called them and asked if I could participate and send in the forms et cetera and so forth
we could go back to television shows speaking of public tv have you caught any of this series on the bible?
I have I've heard that it's coming out with the idea that the bible's not true
that's you could interpret it that way
I think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the bible itself after the king james version when the committee wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in greek
for example in greek there are seven different words for love
so you can have there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for love of your father and that sort of thing so those types of interpretations really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now and what it's at
so that's you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical fact involved just from the histories that were developed around that time that are available to deny that at least the majority of it is true
so it depends on how you look at it
you can look at it if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true then you can very much look at it that way I guess if you're looking for that you're
you can interpret the t v show in the same way that you can interpret the bible that
but as far as that goes we at least agree on what we enjoy that's right
but I don't know if there is a time limit on this so surely we've made it I think so too let's just it's been very pleasant talking to you it was very nice talking to you and have a good evening you too
what kind of house do you live in?
we live in a brick home in far north dallas and it's four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back and it's about thirty five hundred square feet
it sounds like ours are pretty similar I live in one I don't have a swimming pool and mine's about twenty seven hundred square foot
but the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about alike I think it's pretty much typical for this area
it is have you been living there very long? I've been in the house about twelve and a half years
so you've been there longer we built this one about it's been let's see it's been six and a half years ago
and we subcontracted it out ourselves we bought the lot and had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
and then we subbed it out so we've been here a little over six years now and have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in I bet you
my husband got his big garage we have a three car garage that he has a big work area in
and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and so he has all the work space he needs that sounds interesting I bet he's enjoyed having it that way
he because kind of hard to find one prebuilt that kind of fits those specifications
it is and that's why we decided to build we looked at things that were already built
and if the house was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have then most of them don't have a three car garage
they're kind of rare
so we put a three car garage in
but even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space all of it was taken up with just car space
and so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on
that we've just got a two car garage but my husband's got a big space in between where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop workbench and everything
sounds like our husbands have similar interests mine does not work on cars he just piddles on this and that
I see but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his piddling things
that's nice that it's not in your house it really is
because they have a lot of things of their own and I wouldn't mind having and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
but someone I don't know it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something
so I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would
we still have a son and daughter in college that come home
and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come his parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay
and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom
I still all three of my daughters are married but I don't know I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time and some of them coming back home and things
I understand and we've got grandchildren now so when they come they have to have a place we that's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room that's right you sure don't at times I keep thinking though that might be kind of nice
I haven't reached that point yet I've heard people say that
but my middle son is engaged my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while
he's out of college and has a good job
so he could afford to get married but is not engaged yet
and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first
that's what she plans to do I don't blame you for that
I hope so I have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons
and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls a whole new world
and I enjoy them coming but for short doses I can understand it feels after they've been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house they know everything but they're fun
so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute I just watch them
I never did put things up when my kids were little and I haven't with them I try to teach them not to get into things
that's the same thing that I did I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren I think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes at least my daughters have they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up so it's worked pretty well there's I don't really think anything's been broken every now and then we have to kind of go and say don't bother this
but all in all they mind pretty well but I guess most of the what kind of roof does your house have? here I'm getting off the subject we have
what kind of music do you like? I was thinking about it for a long time and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music I don't have a whole lot of dislikes I like jazz especially the blues and I like a lot of the classics everything back from bach and beethoven and chopin and just in general everything
I enjoy a lot of the modern forms
do you like rock and those kind of things punk even that gets
some of the punk when I was in high school that was one of the big things was punk music and some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the actual
I don't think they have a whole lot to say even it really expresses some of the opinions of the people who enjoy the music
I guess but as far as a musical art form I just don't see a whole lot of art to it
do you like rap? some of it it depends the two types of rap I enjoy to listen to and one is the rap that is just funny and they usually do a lot of satire
that kind I kind of like
some of it is kind of pointless the monotonous
that's not I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about I'm better than you and I don't like that
I like the funny satire and then some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in urban society
it really does it talks about race relations and police relations and that
I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times
I'm with you though I like classical
I don't like to listen to it all the time but some of the time anyway I like easy listening just kind of I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more I used to like it all right but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason let's see country western I'm not quite as big on that some of it's okay that's about my opinion of that it's okay
some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess the thing about country western that I don't enjoy is doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it
one country and western song sounds like every other country and western
a lot of them sound really similar
and so the musicians don't get to really get into their music they just play a certain number of chords
the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song and
that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes too I guess they don't really has kind of the same sound over and over and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them too
and I can't say that I like a lot of the very modern rock and roll
but I really enjoy the fifties the sixties and some of the seventies rock and roll
earlier things and I really enjoy especially the sixties
tell me about your home
right now we're living in it's me my wife and two young boys and right now we're in either a zero lot line or a garden home which you might call it
so we don't have a big yard but when my wife and I first moved in it was just the two of us so it was enough
and it's what they call a story and a half because it's not a full two story where everything on top is on bottom
so it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
and it's about a five year old house now it sounds nice
it's pretty nice unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already
it was a landmark is the one who built it these guys that gambled high lost big
that's true and I'm insulating myself from that problem exactly what happened to them I'm building my own house
that's nice and as I look out the window of my trailer I can envision all the insulation that's going up today
are you doing it yourself?
I used to be a builder
that's nice and I retired about five years ago and started college I see
and now I'm a college educated builder there's still no work
so I decided this summer that we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so I did
that's great and the state has a law that says you can not borrow the money to build your own home is that so? I didn't know that you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own
that sounds kind of dumb it's to protect the banks from guys that say I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's holding the bag
as you know anything that involves the government works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much that's right hence the savings and loan problem we have
that's true but my home is fairly simple it's designed to be added on to
that's good I figure it's just me and my wife but I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot so I want to have a shop how big a lot do you got it on? ten acres
that's nice that's real nice it's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor he's on the other side of a hill
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon seriously
that's pretty good in the winter time I can see another guy but he's
I can just make out his place I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north and
that's pretty good I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the house has no heating or air conditioning
you don't plan on putting any of that in? it's got a very small furnace
and we'll use a wood burning stove as well
but in the house itself I've been working inside these many months
and I have not had to use the heat
because it's all geothermal
that's pretty good and with all the I've got on the south side is all glass as much as I could get in it and the east side is glass
I've got one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty eight feet so it's almost all glass and
my wife would love that there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows she loves lots of windows that's great so
is it a single story? not really it's on the side of a hill
I see so the first the residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep
I see and the side that's on the other side is about six feet high
so I've got a pretty good grade there
and then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
that's kind of like a victorian style?
I've always liked that the we don't have much yard but I built a small deck in the back
but I see these magazines where dig your own deck
I kind of wish I had them those size property and one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck
what do you like to cook?
I like to cook foods I like to eat I like to eat italian food best
and I find that that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals type things and they're kind of convenient
that would be good for a dinner party to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things coming out at once
is that what you usually cook when you have a party
I usually have parties that are smaller groups I've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like thanksgiving and such
and so I guess I usually do I like to cook heavy sauces and noodles and pasta and such that sounds good fattening
how about you what do you like to cook? we it's funny that we're talking about this we just had a dinner party and we had our senior pastor and his wife came over
and I catered to their diet is the only thing though so it wasn't something I really wanted to make I really wanted to make red beans and rice with sausage
because I'm from new orleans originally
and I was going to make that red beans and rice with those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff and there's salad and then for desert I really wanted to make just brownies or french donuts would have been good but it's real hard to make them they don't really come out like they do in new orleans up here I don't know why
I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have but
humidity or something that's what I want that's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that but
kind of like the italian it's really good but instead I catered to their diet so I made baked chicken in the crock pot and it was good and everything it had all the vegetables in it but it seemed kind of boring compared
it kind of down played compared to what you would like
do you find yourself with all the cholesterol and high fiber changing the way that you entertain? I find it changing the way that I eat but not the way I entertain because I guess I feel like if they're on a diet like that I'm going to honor that but if it's just another couple came over a couple weeks later and I made what did I make that night I made a roast
and I made I can't believe this my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday
I can't believe that anyway but I asked when ricky and carrie came over we made a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit
and normally we don't eat like that during the week because of the calories and the fat in it
but when we're having guests we just kind of say just do it and I made blueberry cobbler and we had extra crust with it it was so fattening that sounds good but I don't think we gained any weight from it so
every once in a while I think I feel the same way when I'm entertaining I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really really a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play sometimes I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she didn't eat it
but I did bake apples so that it would be not brownies I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
so I've read a good brownie recipe
that's good anyway so I guess that's about what I did when I entertained
so do you have anything else you want to say about it?
nothing comes to mind right off so I guess not it was nice talking to you you too
I did hear the end of the prompt this time was that you that we didn't hear the whole prompt?
and it said do we think that certain crimes should fit certain punishments and I was thinking about it after I got off the phone that I really wish that there was some way to send a message to people about child abuse and things like that
that those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment too often I feel that people get off without
I agree with you although I will say I'm not sure I sometimes have a problem with some of the more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have was because they were abused as children and the parents are saying wait a minute we didn't do anything like that
and I guess before I'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be an absolute certainty like caught at it or something
or if they severely beat up on a child I would have absolutely no problem at all with
I don't buy the routine they're just sick or they were abused when they were little
forget that sometimes they even wonder when criminals plead temporary insanity for crimes that are so severe and then they get sent to a mental institution
and they play loony for a while and then they're back out in public
but I can't see that either I don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any reason to not use capital punishment
I agree I agree because we
I think if I wanted to badly enough I could convince somebody I was crazy so my family may say that on occasion who knows
I don't think it's that hard to do to convince somebody that you just had no control over what you were doing
and too they can always be blaming the other person she looked like my mother who abused me when I was a child or something which I think is unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse
I guess a lot of and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused by the man she loved and
that's the new one is that the new I just happened to see the headline on it and I couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what but I thought if children are being abused I'm wondering how our school system is failing that they're not even seeing this if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger and that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having to deal with that yet but still
you're right and yet did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this? never
and I lived in california which I feel like california anything can go on in california
but I was from conservative wisconsin
and there was nothing on it which makes me wonder if it's as prevalent as some of them claim
it's you just don't know and it all unless they're caught in the act or the child is very badly beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing
texas is capital punishment for it used to be just capital murder and now they added mass murder are those the only two things that we I really would have no idea I don't really know
because I have a feeling it is and I think there ought to be more things added to it
that would be pretty lenient in my opinion
I killing a child or kidnapping and possibly not I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt if they release them two hours later he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty that or I've heard when I
what go ahead and tell me about your home
my home at the moment is an apartment is that right?
I work here in germantown but I live in pensacola florida that's interesting
I own a home in pensacola and let's see we are to compare homes correct?
my home is typical for the area I live in a development it's a relatively it sounds like I'm bragging that's okay
but it's upper middle class kind of an environment
it's a two story colonial which my wife and I designed that's neat
it has around thirty two hundred square feet five bedrooms and so forth and so on that's large
and I would imagine in terms of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area it might be I would say it's probably midsized for the area there are some smaller and there are several larger
but based in terms of in that area of florida it's what
it is probably ten years old that's not too bad
that's still fairly new
and so it's in terms of cost and size and so forth it the housing there is extremely affordable compared to other parts of the country let's say compared to maryland that same house here would probably cost three quarters of a million dollars but you're kidding
do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there what it's
I really haven't when we built it ten years ago it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars
so I haven't really priced in the market
so I it sounds like from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
dallas is a very marked up area although right now it's a lot lower because of all the layoffs and everything
the economy around here is real poor
I thought that was on the upswing again now not really
the area itself the fort worth dallas area has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies including texas instruments
there's been tremendous amounts of layoffs so really housing is real bad the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad but housing is still real bad
pensacola has it's really is a buyer's market there now this is
and it isn't because of the there has been a lot of speculative building I don't know perhaps not in dallas
but I'm sure people in galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it pensacola is a navy town
and home porting was a possibility a few years ago
they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the navy
a new carrier was coming in and the attendant support vessels that's no longer the case so do you think it was overdeveloped then?
it is the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population
and so overbuilding has been a real problem there
so you can still get a good house for a very very reasonable price and good I would let's say typical say three bedroom two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land reasonable construction would probably run you right now somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars and probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood
what about your home? right now we're just renting but it is a home
it's a four bedroom home it has about eighteen hundred square feet it's on one floor
we have no basement I don't know nor do we but
I wasn't sure most of the ones up north and everything do
but anyway it's also pretty typical for the area most of this area was developed this house was built in seventy four
so most of the it's almost twenty years old and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style we have a friend that lives two blocks over and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same so I think most of them are there was it like most areas that are built there were probably two or three styles you could choose from
and that's pretty much all the houses in the area for probably a square mile at least maybe even a little bit more than that
the housing here in maryland is just atrocious and in the entire d c area I'm only about twelve miles or so from the border of washington d c and montgomery county maryland is probably one of the most expensive places to where are you in relation to sevren? are you close to sevren? we are west
sevren is east near the eastern shore I just if I had I have a sister that used to live in sevren
and they bought their home around nineteen seventy five or something like that and they paid they had it built from they designed it and everything and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
that's not unusual so I just wondered if the whole area was like that or
that area over there is not as expensive as in the immediate washington area
and so I was just looking for example there is a condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live and I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium and ninety two thousand dollars for a two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment
it was very nicely done I would have thought sounds like a lot of money though
I can't envision spending that much money on something along those lines
so it's I guess you pay the piper plus the taxes around here are phenomenally high
for the and so you on that it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house in pensacola florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes maybe a little bit higher than that now but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it that's
so it's so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county drive twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately the same price maybe a little lower
but the taxes would be perhaps maybe one third of that much of a difference? so it's really sad
this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country why is that? do you know?
they do have such things as extremely good school systems for example it has one of the best school systems in the country
and because the cost of living around here is so high
public employees make great salaries around here I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the montgomery county public schools makes
and I'm not this is the figure he makes eighty thousand dollars a year that's
and I by administrator I think I mean they did not define it but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone in that range
I guess I've always kind of liked golf I worked on a golf course at one time and that's how I picked up golf and I don't know it's just kind of a challenging game
it sure is I play at least three times a week
I'm on it I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play I'm trying to get back into it so I got to start all over again it's not like riding a bicycle you do tend to forget
I'm one of those rare left handed golfers and I do enjoy playing what is your handicap?
right now it's three I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago it's probably up there to twenty now if I to start again
if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down I have got to try and get out there I know with our long winters I enjoy watching it I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to see the warm weather
we can usually play here year around sometimes in january it's not too comfortable to play
but there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play and I'm pretty much addicted to golf so I get out there one way or the other that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring to get back out
it's a good game though it's very challenging and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself
that's the way I look at it I play in a lot of groups but they keep score between themselves but I really don't care I go out and each shot I say this is what I'm going to try to do
and then I see how close I can come to that you always work on trying to improve each day and
and inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another either I'm not driving very well or I'm not hitting long irons very well or I'm not putting well but sometimes it all comes together I know what you mean when I used to golf out there I'd putt well but I wouldn't chip well one of the two or something would go wrong but I always managed to get near par anyway
we just had the tour championship here in pine hurst
and I went to that craig statler won in a playoff
but we this is a big golf area
we have a lot of I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course pine hurst and we still have the greensboro open here every year do you have long waits to get on the course?
we do as a matter of fact it's only been that way in the last five years
but now you most of the courses have a two day advance tee time you have to call I just moved into this small community so I'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here I'm hoping that won't be
I was from the twin cities area
that's some cold golf too isn't it? are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather? we have cold
usually january and the first two weeks of february I wish that's all we had
but last week we were in the seventies something is coming through now so it's in the low forties right now
but it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties we have very windy winters and very cold
but we don't get any snow anymore I don't know what changed that pattern we used to get four or five inches a year now we get nothing it's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall I see at least that doesn't get in the way of golfing so that
but I have played golf in the snow before get out my orange golf ball and go out
that's what they do here sometimes you hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there but if you got
what do you watch much t v or
I don't watch much t v usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news the news
but I don't think of that every day even
I think I get most of my current events I get them from everywhere I sometimes watch t v if I I guess I watch t v if I haven't read the paper that day we don't get a paper but I work at a I teach a college class and
there's a the library has a paper and so I often drop in on a break and read it
and I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home
and then I figure if there's big news I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else
I also I get it from all over I watch the news every day and we have a news we get the newspaper and magazines anything
I'm I read a lot so I get I'm really up on current affairs I get the news and everything
what's your favorite news do you get a news magazine or I'm not getting I'm not getting any news magazines
but as I said I do it's easy to keep up on current especially when you get a paper every day we've got and
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage? I don't know is there anything missing? I
it's kind of hard to know and I don't know what are we supposed to compare it to the quality
whatever they tell you I guess I'm satisfied I they're supposedly covering everything that happens so you know
I do feel a little bit like being from california and wanting to hear I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something and
I don't ever hear it in the news here
sometimes it's such a it's so slight the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper
but most of the times I find that even if they do have tremors out there there'll be a small article in the paper about it but
I sometimes feel like the dallas paper and the dallas news the top headlines are always a murder that's what sells papers
that's because there's a high crime rate
that's been like that since the first newspaper
I'm sure but I don't know I guess I'm satisfied I don't
what basis of comparison do we have really? we don't get a
that's true we certainly get enough coverage we can get news there's even the c n n channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day I was going to
sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad
it's all so negative often times but
so we have to keep talking I guess I guess we can end
it's just whenever we're is it really?
have you always gone until the recording? I don't
I guess we're not supposed to I don't know I guess we're supposed to wait or I don't know
I one was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening
and it was really funny I mixed it made the call and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away
and it was really we were laughing I mean but we don't really do any gardening so that took a minute
and then we just talked about whatever
interesting some topics really this topic this is there really isn't much to say after you tell the person where they find their sources of information from
and then if they're satisfied and that's about it really
it's hard to talk for five minutes on this
I guess I can just say it bothers me that I hear a lot on the news that it seems like some things are sensationalized or some things are you'll hear one report and then you'll hear that they didn't
do you have any friends that have children? I do have friends that have children and what do they say about finding adequate child care? they
I think that may be the key word I think that's correct they're relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends it seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain still you have to deal with the people that happen to be operating it locally
and it's just a matter of trust I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and underpaid and I think that sort of goes hand in hand so it's difficult for them
we certainly found that to be true
indeed we've our children are now eleven and nine
and we moved away from institutionalized child care and found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
at one point in time we've had au pairs by trading services with them
and that worked for a while but adequate ones were really tough to find I'm sure that's true
it takes that mixture of a very mature college student who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time and the interest to the children
I do have a friend that she and her roommate became live in care givers and they loved it they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old up until they were well into grade school and she was paid very well because the parents trusted them and they had done such a good job so I can see where someone in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that that's true
and that's something that we're struggling with now I think it's just a matter of priorities it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well I think
much as other cultures disagree our lives don't revolve around our children and that's bad to have to admit too but it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home and I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children I it's just such a responsibility and when I've had friends that have said when you hear people say it alters your life forever take heed I realize that's true so it's such a responsibility
it certainly is if I can the other side of the coin for a moment
it is such an honor and a thrill to be a parent that most of the time it's worth it most of the time
I just have to be honest about it it's not always worth it
there are those times when I think if I didn't have children I could be out playing bridge or golf but it's funny I had a friend that said before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older and she said but we never do those things anyway so why am I waiting it's just the way your attitude changes and you mature I suppose but the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work it's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he as well but they need the money and when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby to someone else I can imagine how emotional it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care it's just a scary thing
we were lucky when our children were that age and having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children that's a big plus
and felt that feeling of safety
and were leaving them small children
but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older
it's that care givers are not omniscient
they are not all things to all people or all children
the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers
I think it takes a I don't know I think your patient level needs to increase as the child gets older I think that might be part of the problem with some people taking care of a baby is not an easy thing but when you have them in their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly I'm sure that's a whole new ball game
I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby you sound like you're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about since they're both in school you don't have to worry about a full time person to take care of them
you don't know what happens after they get in school that's something altogether different
we have one takes piano lessons somewhere on one afternoon
and the other one of course can't do the same thing of course not
it has to be somewhere else and it's not adequate to sit and wait you can't do that that just that will not do that's out of the question I'm sure of course but we are helping
we are being cooperative what's wrong with you?
you don't understand this
that's just the way their minds work and it's almost everyday that's amazing it's amazing that people actually the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it it must be interesting I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought maybe
I've been finding out that I really am a nice person hit for many years
because I didn't need it and now I need it now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly I'm sure
and it stays low a lot
are your children now do you feel comfortable with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home or absolutely not
one of them I would leave unsupervised any time any place any where
the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes that's just a difference in kids I suppose that's true
what one leads the other?
and and it's the one that's going downhill is it the one that needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one?
of course how unfortunate
you don't think that good prevails I'm living in a dream world what do I know as I said I don't have kids and I'm an only child so I've never been around children so I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned but I do hear my friends talk about it
we're having such fun my wife and I were both only children
and we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends
that's like world war three every minute I don't know I have to admit I was selfish as a child I didn't want a brother or sister and now that I'm older of course it's different I think about wouldn't it be nice but anyway
just make good friends I have wonderful friends that's true my best friend is one child of ten and so they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child so that worked out pretty well she never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them so I guess that's an alternative if you could just have a whole bunch have enough by the time the youngest ones are there you'll have older one to take care of them
that's true I don't know when you see all these horror stories on television about child care and I just I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories and of course people are denying it and it's just frightening it really is
what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't understand
and then you don't really know what happened
we gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of hair ribbon tied in a chair where obviously she had
my name is donna and I'm calling from plano texas
this is laurie and I'm in garland would you like me to go first?
I have three children two who are in regular school eleven year old an eight year old and then my little one three year old is in a university of gymnastics it's a preschool
and I think it was really hard to pick the right day care or preschool or mother's day out I guess you can classify them all together
some of the qualifications that I look for was the cost and exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic in there and what the qualifications of the teachers were and if the place was clean and the hours
and just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff
we don't have any children but we're going to have one next year congratulations
so that's something that I'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future we haven't quite decided if I'm going to I'm working part time now and I don't know if I'll be doing that or what we're going to do or staying home
but if we do then I'm going to need to find somebody and our church has a mother's day out program which they started last year and we know a lot of people at the church so I would feel very confident with leaving my child there that's a very good place to start I think
the mother's day out programs and that's where shannon had started in a mother's day out program
and the churches always have a pretty good program and you have to make sure that you apply pretty early because a lot of places have very long waiting lists
and another question to ask is if they're state certified if the teachers have their master's degree in child education and child development
what kind of a structure is it going to be when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap
is there a mandatory nap time?
time what they do at shannon's school is have a video tape going and they lay on these little mats and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones and the other ones get up and go do something else
so she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there which is nice
it's kind of scary because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately that's true
and so I guess it's such a growing concern but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear and sometimes when the child's a lot younger before three years old the church is a good program and sometimes you even consider having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or something like that
and another consideration is what's the ratio of teachers to children to children
because that makes a difference and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day just your child or do they just put any child in any crib
you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed
I'm sure that whatever you decide you'll be happy with
and it's exciting time to have a new one
we're pretty excited I bet that's wonderful
but we have been thinking about that but it's a little ways off in the future
but I figure I'd probably start asking around at church because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be before you can bring them in asking
some places take them as infants like eight weeks even
there's a place to look into a friend of mine who's a nurse was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place on fifteenth street up it's in plano somewhere where nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants and then only up to two years old
and it's supposed to be really a some places just specialize in just real little ones
and then other ones are the older children
but it is a difficult situation I think when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry what type of lawn and garden work do you do?
I do it all I see do you have a garden?
I try to grow a vegetable garden and we do the same thing I just have a small plot it's ten feet by five feet
I have two plots one's ten by ten and one's fifteen by four I see
it's a long skinny one and you do a lot more area than I do I've all the rest of my backyard is pool and decking it's all the dirt I have left in my backyard I see
I see I enjoy fiddling around it's cheap entertainment
it's nice to get out in the open air it is and especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever that's right
but sometimes I wish I had more space I enjoy excuse me go ahead
I grow a lot of things a lot of food
and sometimes I want to plant something there's not enough room to plant some of those things like the things that vine like cucumbers or squash or something like that plant one of those that's right that's right takes a lot of room
and it takes up your whole space it sure does I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe what a mistake that was
they just run all over the place don't they they do
it was very good it just takes up like you say a lot of your garden area
it's the first and only time I've done that we don't do anything exotic we just do tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips not turnips carrots beets and things like that the basics
that's what we do too my wife used to plant a few snow peas I don't really care for snow peas she just plants a few for herself peas
I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago did you really?
the first one they started them indoors this time I read it I see
and so I we don't start anything indoors we just wait until the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that probably so you can get a head start on it
but sure is a heck of a lot of work I guess it would
because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered
and I don't think I'll do it again it will make them taste better I'm sure
I enjoy it I come home from work and I usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle just walk around the yard and inspect it
you got to inspect it
and the kids want to swing
and I push them on swing
and I mow my own lawn
and I don't have a sprinkler system I don't enjoy watering especially I this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system
how and it is really nice
it sure beats dragging hoses around
you can have it come on just early in the morning and off by the time you're up and about that's right that's right it's really nice
I usually get it started for my wife
and she moves it around ever other day I'll have to admit I do my own yard I really don't enjoy doing that I enjoy having a nice looking yard
I just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done
I had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months until I retired
and now I've lost my excuse for that so I have to for the last couple of years I've done it myself
sometimes I wish I could get one of these chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of
but they want too much money it is kind of expensive it is
of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them they're expensive too
but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself that's right if I have a problem discipline I think I really need to get out and apply something and I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something
and the weed come up that's right
and all of a sudden you've got to do something else that's right I'm kind of bad about that
I enjoyed having a lawn service but now I have the time and I really don't want to spend the money for it
if you enjoy it too you can get out in the morning before it gets hot and do it and stuff when you only have to that's right
I'm not limited to just mowing it on saturday morning
I can do it on most any day of the week
when the days start getting a little longer I can start doing it in the evening after work that's right when they switch
when we get an hour more when they rollback an hour that's coming up here pretty soon is it this weekend? I don't know it's pretty soon
I really don't know it just seems like I here it on the news the day before
and I think it's coming up here soon I believe it is too
are you having any trouble with bugs in your garden? not a whole lot I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust
I don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then again I don't want the bugs eating it upping either
I it seems like they come in spurts
one year I didn't put anything on and I didn't have any problems
next year I was planting some broccoli and some of those cabbage loppers or whatever
they were just covered with them
I went up I didn't go out there for about three days and I went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem that's right
they devoured it that quickly they really go through it
and they have a good appetite they really do
and they would I picked off like twenty of them and cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too they'll strip
they got that b t spray this year
and I've been watching them every day and I haven't seen any signs yet so if I see any signs I'm going to spray them
and I did something a little bit different this year that I haven't done before I've got my garden is shaped that I can it's kind like this box shape so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
and various other things raised it up the good stuff
and I'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there that maybe I'll have less of a bug problem at least they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing
my backyard is sloping so I built a box up had to build the low side up
and I had sandy loam hauled in I had a dump truck come and dump it
on my driveway that's what they do and then I had to wheel barrow it in
but you can improve your own soil there but the texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil that's right
you have to work on you really do
and if I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what I mean that's right when we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam for my garden so I had a lot of loam out there to start with I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with
do you have a rotor tiller? I don't I did it by hand
small enough you have a just do it by hand?
it wasn't too much of a job
like I say it's just
I'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines it would be handy
and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that
my neighbor across the street has one he always uses it to dethatch his lawn I see him out there and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it it might be handy
they're pretty neat little I've never seen one
I have a friend who has one and he lets me no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle to go up
and it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van bring it home and check it back and just grab it if I just go to my garage and grab it that would be neat
that would be nice we've had a garden for years and years and years of some size
I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind
what have you got growing right now? got tomatoes that are starting to bloom
and I've got a few carrots up and I've got some radishes up
and as a matter of fact I've already done a second row of radishes
and the green onions are coming along snow what kind excuse me
what kind of onions do you grow? do you grow those ten fifteen y? I've for the first time we planted them this year
they are the best we tried to find them last year we screwed around and waited too long and I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left
but we've got some this year
those snow peas are up and my wife does a small herb garden on the side I see they're up and doing fine
I those onions we planted twice as much this year because we got onions and they lasted from about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until october
and we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just can't compare
that's kind of a let down
she made these onion rings that were so good I bet
and you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it's an ingredient they were that's right we use a lot we sure do
and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better one nice thing with onions and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have too many
we froze a lot of peppers we let some turn red we did that too
and some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas and chops them up in recipes and things like that
makes a colorful salad too put them in salad
you're making me hungry here we planted some yellow peppers this year we've tried it before
and we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year
yellow peppers they have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something
sounds like you have a real good garden we enjoy fooling around with it
just let me see what I got I got the peas and I've got some broccoli onions some radishes and beets beets we've got some beets
and I planted potatoes too I've never done potato we used to do it at home when I was a kid had a huge garden the potato
they're delicious but they you don't seem to get that much for the space
they do it does take some space some potatoes
and I've got some tomatoes still growing in containers I see
I got to wait for a place to free up
our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year that will be neat
we've got some good hybrid burpee pickler cucumbers
and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own and so have you seen how much pickles cost in the store? that will be neat they're expensive
I know it I said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers? I don't know unless it labor intensive or something I really don't know I guess but we're going to try that and see how that works that will be interesting an experiment
I'd like to just try something new every year that I haven't tried before and that's interesting
I'll let you go it's
I guess our topic is advice about going to college
do you have children of your own?
I don't have any children but I'm still going to college are you?
what school are you going to?
n c state are you enjoying it?
it's a lot of work are you working on your bachelor's degree? my bachelor's
and what field of study are you in?
it's actually in computer science
and I have a special interest in voice I o that's neat are you from north carolina?
I'm actually from amarillo texas originally are you really?
what took you to north carolina? the service I see
that was one of the things I was thinking about in school I went to texas tech out in lubbock and I had a friend my roommate went to tech also
but she was from new mexico
and she had to pay out of state tuition
and I think that would have played a real big part of my decision
it would have played a major part in mine because she was of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now it was four dollars a semester hour
and so I was going to school for just a few hundred dollars a semester and she was paying forty dollars an hour
so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state
luckily I've paid in state tuition the whole time that's good so I think that would be one thing I would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that I liked well enough to attend
the second thing is some colleges only offer the liberal arts whereas state they offer engineering courses
so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to attend somewhere like tech
and aside from the some schools may even give you financial aid where another one won't that's true that was something else I had was I had government aid of course but it was wonderful because I got one of those grants that you don't have to repay and it was so nice
it paid most of my tuition and a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing so
that's great I really was it a pell grant? I'm sorry what did you say?
what kind of grant was it? it was called a b e o g a basic equal opportunity grant
and it was from the government and at first it was based on my parents income my parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to send any of us to school
and so because based on the number of children and the amount of money my father brought in I got a small grant
but then after that I was on my own working and trying to go to school on my own so then I got a real big grant because the amount of money I was making really didn't compare
so it was kind of nice
I don't know if those are still available or not but
I'm not quite there's a lot of different organizations who do give grants but I'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much they generally run this was great it was just based on how much your tuition costs and everything and generally it paid everything so I went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing so that was
that's great it was really nice
another thing I've got a degree from another college
and something that might play a part is the size of the college
the smaller schools can give you a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools
in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and they just give you a teacher's assistants instead of a scholar you get a t a that's right
and you don't get near the quality of education and as well the smaller schools often times don't cost as much I didn't know that
I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was between a christian college because I thought about attending abilene christian instead of texas tech
and of course the price was just astronomical compared to tech
the christian college was so much more expensive but I guess some of the other smaller colleges might be a lot different
at state I think it's just a waste of somebody's money to go there
it's really a shame because of the instruction
I'd rather go to any other college in the state and I would definitely get my money's worth much better than state
it's kind of unfortunate because they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students any more you're just a number
they're bent on seeing how much more land they can get and how much of the campus they can build up and
it's really a bad situation here that's a shame I felt a little cheated at tech also once I got into my I majored in
why do you think it sounds do you think we should adopt it?
I don't like metric system you don't?
I think the country is too ingrained in the inches just the general background the history of our country has been inches and I don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system
it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and how far away something is
and it's not in our national consciousness to do it we've always measured things in the english system and everything
our land is in acres our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is
I agree with you I don't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system I don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in america
and also the I don't know it seems almost like it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations because I think that's an area that the other nations look down on us like we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet and I feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it's we're content with this it's probably not as accurate probably intellectually doesn't it's not as sound intellectually but like you said come on I had six years of college and I don't know the metric system and I don't care to learn it
and I'm not some kind of an idiot I just
and it's easy to we have a computer for just about everything now and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done
because I'm a mechanical engineer and I've had to work when I was designing packages for people I had to work both systems back and forth
and it was not hard and you can get a cat cam system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every measurement on there from one system to the other in seconds there's a lot of people
you're educated I'm educated my husband is but a lot of people are flat not educated and if I have a hard time putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college
or I don't know how much of the
but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all
and if we can't take it and use it easily how can you put that on elderly people and just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as much sharpness and mental acuity it's just
or even have had the chance to go to college or to learn about
I think it's still good they do cover the system I think it should still be taught in schools
and they do I know now because I even when I was in elementary school years ago we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and basically the other alternate forms of measurements things like that
and that's acceptable I think it failed too because what you said this is ridiculous the thing americans have so much stress on them right now
if you look at the average family it's like they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this
it's come on let's take the pressure
you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters and it's just like another thing
the american family doesn't need any more pressure just leave them alone let them measure their drinking water in cups and leave them alone
and it just doesn't make that much difference in the average life and the scientific community and places where it's needed that's fine
and the rest of the world we are it's not we may not be the top I don't know if we're the top we're one of the top superpowers of the world that's
it may be arrogant but let them come to us
that's kind of the way I feel about it we can convert and if they don't like the way we do it just don't worry about it and I think
it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak german it is
because it is another language
and instead of saying the world speak german we found out that we can translate and that's what I think we ought to do with the metric system that's funny well that's good I think we kept it at real good
is that all we need to say?
it's been nice talking to you you too I think that was good
that was the best one usually I get distracted off the topic you know what I mean
and we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in lithuania and we were talking about income tax or something and I just
good talking to you anyway I appreciate it have a good day
on this subject I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home
so I've always been involved in one
how do you feel about them since you've kind of been close to that I can kind of see both sides
I really can nursing homes to me I would personally be the last resort if I had to put someone in there
I've had a touch of experience my dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him if it's a have to thing I
and she put him in but he wasn't there very long before he died
but I guess the one time that I saw him there as far as the surroundings that seemed okay
but we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of keep him real out of it all the time
and that's always kind of bothered me I kind of think that's true too because it's so under staffed
that's like everything else though
I have a sister in law who runs a nursing home but I've never actually been there
and I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about but
but still I'm sure there are aspects to it that aren't really desirable
I know I've always my sister's involved in one also and I really think they really do a wonderful job but still there's those little things that happens
there really is which I think it's a wonderful place if it comes to that if you just can't take care of them any more
sometimes you don't have any other alternative that's it
family's tied up with their own lives and things and usually working other things and it's hard to
but I think when the time comes I hope to have the time to really look around and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at
I think that's important too in fact there's a I do too
outside's awful deceiving sometimes
there's one close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to walk in on your own in other words you can't be in too bad a shape to start out with
but then if you deteriorate they have a separate section for those who need care all the time
but it's always and they have a long waiting list too so there's always this feeling of you've got to be able to walk in the door so you can't wait until you're too bad off off
but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because you have to give up your automobile or whatever to
and everything you worked so hard for all your life
and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment
so that's a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home there is some really nice ones there's also some private ones
but of course I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that
that's the problem that's way out of my reach
the expense of it all is and another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care the very same
so I don't like that aspect but I think there's ways around it though that they could put it in one of their children's names or something
but still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that it's their money
that's right that's how I feel about it anyway
I've talked to my mother about that several times lately and I said I want you to have control of your own business
but what if my mother's seventy now so naturally she's retired but she's still on her own I mean
my mother's seventy five and still has her own home and everything I think that's wonderful I really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy
that's true they have a lot of people around to do things with they're not lonely
some of those places have wonderful activities and things lots of stuff going on
and they'll take them places
I don't know it's not all bad
but I guess once you get ill then you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things around
but I really don't know what the other solution would be
I really don't but when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents
really do because I have been raised in one so there's lot of things I know to look for
and I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either I really don't
that might be kind of tough it really would and like I said my sister's still in it and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there either
it's been nice talking to you
you too and I guess we'd better get back to work
I grew up out in the country and was used to having guns around the place and I'm not for gun control in the strictest sense of the word
I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself
I have quite a collection myself and I'm a good hunter and I started hunting when I was twelve years old of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes and I don't want to see them ban guns completely
but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either so I feel that its I think the what was national rifle association had this bumper sticker a few years back about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then
I believe that and I believe that too because the person that is wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun a knife a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with
and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns we can handle it but there's an element that can't
and it's got to the point now where even our police departments and our d e a agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them they have got them outgunned
you know so there was an article in the paper just this week where one of the gun companies was developing a ten millimeter automatic pistol for the f b I which would give them additional firepower
it held a fifteen shot clip they would be able to put down anything that came at them
that would be but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an uzi machine gun a thirty eight
that's smith and wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good
it's sure not I have lived in illinois at one time and they passed a it wasn't really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns
but you had to have this card it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition
and that was the first this was twenty years ago
but they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect
in california they make you register when you buy ammunition
you have to sign a they take your name and driver's license number hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition especially for handguns
rifles aren't too bad but any kind of handgun at all and a rifle you would still have to buy it or sign up for it so we lived in tennessee for awhile and I bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period you had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted
and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
that's not a bad idea I think that a waiting period can make a difference
but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that
it is so I don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because
the only way they could do it would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course I feel kind of weird about that anyway I think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot I'm
we're getting into capital punishment now
but but I agree with you there that
it would definitely be gun control again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be
it's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one
and I'm in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element myself
and they're actually a necessity in life
they're not not everybody needs a gun but sooner or later I need one whether I'm out hunting or I'm never had to protect my life or
I did in the service but not on the street so I don't really need one in the aspects you don't have to carry one in your car or your pocket all the time
so I use mine for recreation
I don't and I enjoyed my guns
I have a good time with them so I know what I took my kids out and taught them out how to shoot a gun my wife the same thing she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything
but we have several guns around the house one of these days my grandkids probably
but I think it's you got to have the living in dallas there's not that many places to go shoot but still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that it's not like on t v when someone gets shot they get back up
if someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up
I had to explain that to my I've got a six year old now and he I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old they understand now
I've taken time to teach them and now the young boy wants to know and I told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and we would start with the b b gun deal so he started with the b b gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and I took it away from him I said now you know so he's learning the hard way
but at least it was a b b gun not a twenty two or a four ten or something so I remember I had an old uncle up by tulsa oklahoma that took me out and showed me it was my mother's uncle this was a gentleman in his sixties
and he took me out with him and single shot twenty two and taught me how to shoot
we went squirrel hunting and he taught me how to shoot a old single shot twenty two
and I was probably about twelve at the time
and I thought that was the neatest thing and of course uncle sam took me hunting with him
and he let me shoot and showed me how
I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one
I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away so that's about all I we agreed pretty well on this I think
I think so it's been real nice talking with you have a good one
far as crime in the cities I'm sure like in yours it's pretty bad probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about you?
I don't actually live in the city but I'd probably say that's roughly right crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution and sale of drugs probably right if you look at it from that stand point
what is there anything that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
where I live now it's not so bad I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it but I do have friends that live in the city and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing just because there are crack houses on their street and stuff like this do you live in a real small town or out in the country?
I live out in the country how far out from the city do you
I'm about fifteen miles out about fifteen miles I live in a little suburb which from dallas is twelve miles or so
but it's pretty congested we are considered in the country
but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country
our major crimes in our immediate town is probably house robberies and very few instances of alcohol drugs reported
however I'm sure they're there
but right now our neighborhood is running about eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their existence in that neighborhood
that's huge and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or burglar alarms including the outer perimeter type devices sensors and things like that
it's cut back considerably but it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood so it still remains city wide pretty high
are there any theories on why this is happening? I would say the majority of it's happening during the day between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon most
but why? why is it happening? most families are young and both people are working
so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work
so I would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll stock your house and look at your pattern and then go from there
so they're professionals? they classify most of them as professionals
you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier just taking just junk items that they can just get ten to twenty bucks for real quick
probably the biggest items that you get in our neighborhood would be the high classed automobiles the mercedes volvos things that they can get big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets
guns that sort of stuff
very few penny ante stuff
what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime? the police force for one I think they could definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use it's right now we are about thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for that amount of people which is not very many and
but that's going to tend to it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place the course in our particular state we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release
they're doing that in our state too and it's I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences but for the
so you think that would be a deterrent? that would certainly be a deterrent
and not necessarily give in to their human rights desires if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate
what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty? I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty in a lot of cases course I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof
so you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence to convict somebody
and then those convicted especially of murder and major crimes to reach the life sentences and death penalties and follow through with that
especially in the case of murder
I know in my case my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five
and the individuals got caught we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
and two counts of kidnapping the forty five to the head just the mental anguish and the whole nine yards the guy only got five years
and he was out within two months because of the parole system so what
did you sue him under the civil system? do what now?
did you sue him under the civil system? I'm not real familiar with that
you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something and try to get money from him
and the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him and they said he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that you could go after
makes you wish that still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing very
but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt they don't do that here course they pay them but you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money
that's too bad and right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're repeat offenders they been in jail before
they've been released several times which is another deal I hate to see
but basically the guy commits three major crimes and car theft on top of it destroys my car I think that's
and we're out fifteen thousand dollars and the guy gets out in two months
that's awful and he goes out and commits it again fact he's back in jail now so what
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes what deterrent does he really have?
I think in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real possibility
we've had a couple break ins where the people have actually shot the people
and return offenders have they've actually waited for them where they've robbed particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands
course it doesn't always work out in their favor
but nevertheless I think people are just getting fed up and saying you can't arrest all of us
you can get some of us
you can't get all of us
and we're beginning to see more and more of that
and that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed and awake
here you break in and you're going to get shot that's certainly a possibility in we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
and it helps for a while
but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from outside of the state
I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas across the border
so people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
it's not many from the local communities
but it's a problem and I think that the court systems need to be stiffer in their penalties
would be a definite deterrent and giving the police agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people
I tend to agree with you I think what I would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and worry about these things where people are getting hurt
and I think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is if someone is found guilty of a felony level offense they lose their citizenship and they lose their constitutional rights
and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about protecting these people from we just don't protect them I know in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal
I know and I think that's ridiculous they went to all
what baseball team are you familiar with?
I'm only a little bit familiar with the red sox because I lived up in boston for a while
and that's come on no texas rangers?
after that if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but I understand a little bit about the texas rangers I know george bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground and that I heard a joke on the radio yesterday in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system
and the radio's kind of cruel think this chain that must have been on president bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground how humiliating for a man to do that any man I don't care if you're president
but at the same time I don't know it's pretty far to throw that far I couldn't do it I know but he's a man come on men know how to do that?
he's supposed to be able to do that I know so I felt kind of sorry for him that must have been hard on him because he's just a person but I never a major owner of the team here
I didn't know that I thought he was the owner but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you hear about is about neal bush
I even know his name because he's on the news a lot and I never had to watch the news not like some people hour and a half a day or anything
and I've been watching my husband's french and so if I've been watching the french news when I watch it
it's incentive but speaking of bush that had a story where he went to visit some little elementary school students and stuff I saw that
did you see that where the guy asked him for proof of who he was
he said his I want to see your driver's I don't
I know and see a credit card you're not president bush I know and he said it does so fast I heard it on the radio I heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but I didn't see it but
it was so funny to see it was a really cute little kid too that's about my extent about baseball I don't know that much about it
I can tell you that the mets opened two days ago
because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game and I couldn't tell you who pitched but they won the mets won did they?
but not my a lot and then somebody else lost maybe it was the other new york team which is the yankees but I don't even know if they're still new york yankees or new jersey that's so stupid that you all have two teams
that's really stupid
but it then they can have them play against each other I know
I think it's still the new york yankees
I thought they were moving to new jersey this is how much I know about baseball the texas rangers they lost I think
but I know that last year we did go to a baseball game last year we got free tickets because one of the deacons at church parks cars at the mansion at turtle creek which is one of the places and stuff
and he's their head chauffeur as they're parking the cars the valet service
he makes good money too doing that I was shocked but someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year
and then the iranian couldn't he didn't want them so he gave them to alan and alan and his dad had plans that night so they gave them to us he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian with baseball tickets
with baseball tickets and we ended up with them and so we were walking up
and I looked at my husband and I said you know what kyle this is the mansion at turtle creek a tip I bet these are really good seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor
they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and walked and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats because
because they're fancy seats and stuff and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up I just was there like I'm loaded I'm here and it was just kind of funny because but we got to sit by first base if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in
I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game I rarely go but we went last year because my brother is impossible when he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff
and if there's a game on he's watching it that's all there is to it
and he's glued at the t v I'm glad my husband's not like that
I'm glad my husband's not like that either I'd kill him my brother's like that and he goes to a lot of games not a real lot but he tries to go then my father got us some tickets
so my brother's wife and my husband and I went last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because being a non american you want to see what a baseball game is like
and he describes it as you sit there in a crowd it was nice weather and stuff it wasn't a real problem but you sit there in a crowd and you're waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat the hot dogs because we made him try a hot dog that's funny
so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time you miss the whole thing
and so basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it and didn't understand it that's funny
and it he grew up in which is the sort of o strip east to west eastern part where is he from in france?
but that I had a friend in college from strasbourg
he's not that far he was sort of in between strasbourg and paris
paris and my cousin lives in paris and she's lived there off and on for twenty years is she still there? because saint claude is that sound familiar? saint claude
we used to that's one of the entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city
and it sits right at the limit
I exactly where she is but we met in paris that's neat she married and they have twelve children twelve children? she has twelve children
the poor woman she looks gorgeous she's gorgeous and she just liked having kids and she's thin and four or more children are thin
were any of them twins? I'm not kidding you
you probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them your I have a friend now that has seven and they're all nine and under
they're all real young they're just raised right that's what god's told them to do but they're not condemning you if you we only have one child they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy for them to do that you get a conviction like that and you think everyone should have it and so I'm real proud of them because they don't do that at all
you go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there and I always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning
but how do they afford to even have the kids we're expecting our first baby almost any day
and they live lean for one thing and they tithe and they it puts a whole in your money bag we don't honor god with this portion and so they I think that helps a lot I think that's the key in his sales last year he just works a normal job he probably has an income of thirty five thousand but last year he made that got him a bonus of twenty five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van
he loves god it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done
and he got to do it and so god just really blesses him in ways like that do trust god because kids are a blessing and we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things but it's a different kind and a lot times people think I'm not blessed I have an old car but you've got five kids
you're just as blessed probably more because if you follow this there's a good book called what the bible has to say about child training by richard fugate
and he's a lot of wisdom in it and the kids at bible talk about anything but training and training is different than anything else psychology doesn't address it the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the bible and they don't quote you the proverb out of it but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the bible and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen
how to train them so they're going to be a blessing and so they do that and they just live lean pretty much she doesn't shop at foley's and stuff like that but a lot women die or shop at foley's so things
I don't know what foley's is it's a macy's kind of store
it's pretty nice and everything's pretty expensive and you just can't do that and you don't go to baseball games as much or you get pictures like we did you know what I mean?
you do these fun things in other kinds of ways and I know manhattan's real expensive but it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment?
that makes a really big difference but still it's just as hard as having that
but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids church softball leagues so
they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one and I just haven't gotten around to doing it I keep saying we need to have one they go then start one but everybody wants to do it but god's sitting on my heart and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it so they could really only have four members on the team I think they only have four boys I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet
but then you didn't believe me about her kids they are so good I'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it's a commitment and that's what they're called to do
I have a most of my friends
I admire someone that can do that I really can I know I do too most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like that's really why god and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them don't I had my tubes tied so you
I'll just hand it off to you and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today
the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time are crafts and I've been involved in making hat stands and rag dolls and different type hats with flowers and roses and that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff
and I enjoy it it's relaxing and you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by before you realize anything is going on and I play the organ sometimes just for my own satisfaction not for anybody else's ears because I'm not that good at it but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while
how about yourself? hobbies I guess I got too many hobbies so I never have time to deal with them
I like photography a lot
that's neat I used to do that a lot and then I like we have a new child that will be a year old here next week so I'll take a lot of pictures of her and spoil them
that's great first one you know how that is and I play the guitar and a banjo I mainly play the guitar a lot I play about every night and I really love that if I had a druther if I could make it on the road I'd like to play on a bluegrass band or something because that's I've
that sounds nice I like bluegrass too I've done it before when I was in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it
and it's really a blast my wife hates it but that's the way life is I guess
that's the hard part?
if you can do things together that really helps a lot we she's into aerobics and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
that's good too and that went over real well
but that's about it there
it's good and it's healthy too
we do that too we have a treadmill and a bicycle and that kind of stuff we try to get twenty minutes at least three for four times a week that's great that's great
and we like movies that that's spare time with a child it's kind of she's we have we're looking for a baby sitter so we've been out twice in this year so far by ourselves without the child
so it's kind of become an issue you could say
hobbies I like messing around in your house building things and putting cabinets up and those kind of things that's great too
we did some remodeling when we bought a house we put a kitchen in and that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering that's fun it's really kind of fun
it is it really is especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty
exactly I like things that two people can do but I like the quiet of doing things away kind of gives you some space for yourself and that's what I find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that I can create and I like to crochet and knit I made some afghans and that kind of stuff I like doing things with my hands sounds like it
do you like to cook?
I love to cook I love to cook too I'm italian food
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff we're all skinny farts so I it
so when it comes to I like to cook and eat and to have mainly I get to
amount of people eat and then say this is really good
it is but it just work in the garden work around the yard of course
do you do barbecues? we sure do smoke them
smoking and all that stuff? all that hoedown stuff
all that stuff that's bad for you
I lived in abilene for a little while and worked in the abilene plant
and we used to go to joe allen's barbecue and that was great
really great that's only way to do it they have some nice stuff down there
I miss it it's there's pluses to everything
but seems like there's just so many things to do down here I like the sports I play a lot of racquetball
I did horseback riding too in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses and that was kind of for them but they weren't as interested in it as we were so that was a real I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that we always had horses around and I really enjoyed that that's great sounds like you and I was disappointed when I went to texas I didn't see that many of them horses?
you really don't the you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete I know I know it's true there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it down here and so
but that's great sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there
you too you too look I know it's probably late for you
I enjoyed speaking with you me too have a good weekend do you want to start?
I'm trying to think what I've seen lately we just finished watching teenage mutant ninja turtles on tape did you watch dances with wolves did you see the movie?
we've seen that did you like it?
it was great have you seen it? I thought it was very well done I how about ghost?
we saw an we liked it but I didn't think it was as good as all the hype was about it I feel the same way about that too it was okay
I I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for best picture and let's see the most recent ones that I've seen are those two ghost and dances with wolves but I rent videos do you?
and so we just you watch many?
it depends on do you like the classics like gone with the wind and the older movies
I'd like to see those there's three movies that I keep telling myself that I should see one of these some day that I haven't seen that are classics because I've never seen citizen kane that was good
and I've never seen casablanca and never seen gone with the wind I think I've seen most of humphrey bogart's movies but in a long time ago
and the maltese falcon and all those
I we saw part of the african queen on t v a couple of years ago that was good
and I've been wanting to see all of it but we walk into the video store and we're why don't we go see this now so it's true
but I one of the movies we saw recently we saw misery I didn't see that one that was good it was great
and it you think because it was by stephen king it would be really gory but there's only one there's a couple scenes at the end there is some blood and everything and there's one really bad scene where there's not blood but it's pretty graphic
but it's a really good movie is that the one where the guy gets captured by that women?
he's a writer and she's his biggest fan and she's also a little on the nutso side
did you see pacific heights?
we haven't I saw that one that one wasn't that great either
it wasn't? I didn't think so
I got I heard mixed reviews of that we how about silence of the lambs?
that's on our list of things to see I know I wanted to see I was curious if you had seen it and that
our big thing is movie prices up here I think it's six bucks now in the theaters
so it's a lot of things we try to catch at the dollar theater or matinees and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape that's us too true I know it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive
one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was edward scissorhands have you seen that? it was great
it was I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than
it's an odd film and it's really interesting that I like the director a lot a guy named tim burton
did you ever see the movie beetlejuice? part of it I never really watched the whole thing
if you liked beetlejuice you'll probably like edward scissorhands if you didn't like beetlejuice you'll probably won't like edward scissorhands
it's burton's kind of he's a very odd man but he's I think he's very interesting and I liked those two movies of his a lot
he did batman also which that was pretty good though really
it was good but he was when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies
you see it for a couple of hours or an hour and it really there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars and all the different stuff like that
who's your favorite actress or actor?
don't really know I like costner a lot but I'm a big baseball fan
so after bull durham and field of dreams
although that was good I saw that movie too that was very good which one? field of dreams
field of dreams was good and I think I liked the other movies he's done no way out was really good and
did you ever see silverado? silverado who was that with?
let's see danny glover scott glen kevin kline brian dennehy jeff goldblum's in john kreas is in it if you don't blink that the title sounds familiar I'm trying to
it was a big western I think roseanne arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you'd miss her it was and I think it was a three hour movie or two and a half hours and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out
but it was really good I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I would remember with him in it
how about revenge did you see that with him?
I didn't is that any good? with anthony quinn I thought it was I like everything he's done so far
it's one of those movies that it's not a great movie but it was okay
we were in the video store today and somebody was recommending it to somebody the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else it was not a bad movie
I'll have to catch it one of these days you you said you seen no way out? that was excellent
that was very good he was in the untouchables too that's another one I wanted to see in fact that was advertised not too long ago it was on cable?
it was on one of the networks last weekend or two weeks ago I know I saw something about it
I wish I'd seen it when it was originally in the theaters and I saw part of it again
I like costner I like sean connery and there's this one actor it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot but I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in a guy named charles martin smith I don't know him
you've probably seen him and just an that's who the guy is
do you remember did you ever see american graffiti? I don't think so
did you ever see the movie star man
in star man he was the guy chasing after jeff bridges and nancy allen
short nerdy guy with glasses
he's just I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in he was in the untouchables he was the accountant I know who you mean
he was in honey do n't shrink the kids wasn't he?
you're thinking of rick moranis he looks like rick moranis but he's not that's the one I was thinking of but I've seen quite a few movies I enjoy them I think that it's kind of good entertainment an escape type of thing
how about some of the ads do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews? do they influence you a lot
a little of a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see did you see goodfellas?
it's I want to see it that was pretty good and
we want to see godfather part three also but my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago
but I've never seen either of the godfather movies so we're probably going to rent those some time and then try to see godfather part three somewhere I was just going to say you should see those first if you can
if you read the book it's even better the book was excellent
I haven't never read it
and I was a little disappointed in the third it's godfather three it was not bad but I expected more I think
we just rented a couple weeks ago a movie called the freshman with it's got matthew broderick in it and marlon brando and brando does a parody of the character he played in the godfather
it's one of the reasons why the godfather's been on our minds lately but there's a bunch of scenes from the godfather that's used because matthew broderick's going to film school
and in his classes they're running a bunch of scenes from the godfather and then he's running into marlon brando who is playing this organized crime head
so it was a fun movie how about tom cruise do you like his stuff? cocktails or
I liked rainman I thought it was interesting that he was doing that was good I liked rainman too
I'm being from baltimore of course I'm a big barry levinson fan since he's done a bunch of baltimore movies
barry levinson did diner and tinman and avalon which are all set in baltimore they sound familiar I probably saw parts of those a lot of times I'll start watching a movie and I'm tired and it
next thing you know it's especially if there's commercial in it and then the titles might sound familiar but I really don't know what they're all about
of the three of those diner's probably the best they're all pretty good but diner is really worth seeing is that the one set in the fifties or sixties
late fifties late fifties I think I saw that one
and how about meryl streep
I guess we're ready to start I guess what part of the country do you live in? I'm in dallas texas
what about yourself? I'm also in dallas
the reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had have been out of state
but have you always lived here in dallas and I've lived here for almost five years now
I see and I'm a before that I was at school in rochester new york and I'm originally from boston
you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood that's right but I like it
you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow I missed it at first but now I go back there and I'm a real wimp about the cold so I like it here it's nice
that's good I have lived in texas essentially all my life
around in texas and I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it
but I don't know I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters I'm getting older and not sure that's something I want to do I know
I live over in the lake highlands area if you're familiar with that tell me where that is I probably do know
you but I don't know it by that name
this is pretty well where l b j and audelia skillman cross
we're just north of white rock lake I know that area that's a nice area
we have some very nice homes here in this area my particular I guess they want us to describe the area so my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million that's quite a range
the homes that were here earlier were smaller they've gotten larger and larger as they have developed the land and of course it's pretty static right now and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy
how about you? I'm barely in dallas I'm just north of addison airport up on the tollway
and I guess we have a similar situation we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand
and then we've got bent tree right across the street so I don't even know how high those go
but some of those are pretty big
those are over a million so that's the strange thing about dallas because back where I'm from you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles so
we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas
not as bad as houston but exactly what you're describing is what happens all over I've noticed that
do you live in a zero lot home
or we've got a house let's see we moved in about four years ago it had previously been unoccupied but it had existed for three years
this is a whole block of homes that a builder built all of them and I guess he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away type of deal so the whole block was all foreclosed
and so some were vacant for quite a while before they finally sold them because there were so many
was your house in good shape was it damaged? the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open it was? but
so we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that
I see and we haven't had any problems and we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything but the prices are much lower here and this was definitely not a fix up special but I'll tell you it takes all my time
between we put in our own sprinkler system and I just finished repainting the exterior and making drapes and buying furniture it's just a money pit really is
I am familiar with that so
where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it
and we bought it from someone who was in it but before they had it it had sat empty for the better part of a year
and I'm not sure what happened but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for about four years
I found a lot of things but do you have any?
I have a springer spaniel and her name is thumper she's about seven or eight years old I got her for christmas from my family back when we lived in nebraska I like to hunt and so I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like thumper that I could just go out and get all kinds of game did it work?
except we live in plano texas now
so for many years I had a dog that was part springer spaniel I just love them her name was molly but she isn't alive any more we had her for fifteen years and just loved her she was the greatest went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
do you have a pet now? I have a cat now he just turned seven also and I got him in arizona when I used to live there
and he is huge he is eighteen pounds
what kind of cat is it? just I got him he was born in the wild in a shed and had never been in a building when I got him
so he and he must be cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky but he's a very tame spoiled house cat now that I've had him for seven years
being born outside you didn't have any problems house training him?
that's good he's he's great and he's really spoiled though but he's really big so lots of times he seems to get in fights and when he was younger I think he started them and now I think he barely makes it I think he gets beat up even though he's big because he's pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then and older
we went to a cat show at the plano center here in town and we thought that we have a cat now but we thought if we ever get another cat we'd want something kind of unique so we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to siamese cats and persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the maine coon cats I've seen them I
they're huge I have seen them they were actually I can't remember they used to be used on ships and for mousers
so they're very nautical too
I'll be darned I didn't know that I just I think I'm being accurate in the area of folklore but I'm not sure that's interesting
we kind of like my family didn't necessarily like them as much as I did but the manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail
it sort of has a bob tail I kind of like that too but I'd love to go to a cat show I'm a real cat lover I'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let me he doesn't really like mine let alone another one
I'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog and then I suppose our five minutes will be up
I work for a university and I went to omaha nebraska to recruit students and I had some time off in the afternoon so I went to a pet shop and I saw these little springer spaniels
and so I decided this would really be a nice dog to have so when I got back home to carney nebraska I told my wife about it and I said this is just a I can just hear the dog crying for me now I know what you mean
and christmas is coming up and so I had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people that we went with they were friends of ours and so we got to omaha and I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog and so I got over there and she said that's too bad the dog has already been sold and I didn't realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room and so that night we had a reception for some of the potential high school students or college students and he had the dog the whole time in his room and I had no idea and so we headed back to carney that night and the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and I guess while we were inside eating thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car and finally we made it back to carney and
the aids issue is a bit of a problem I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is the financial end and how can a country stand to spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the knowledge or at least the rumor that we're not spending as much per afflicted person on cancer there's some take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting many more people than aids and yet more people die of it and yet the funding has already exceeded aids has more money than breast cancer
than that's interesting isn't it so if it's true I've always heard these things I've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but I've heard it on more than one documentary that they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and it's just one big p r campaign that we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to aids and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years
and it's just course one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not going to get funded and having thought about that for a while
what did you think about that idea? I thought that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then I got to thinking the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed a antibody test for the antigen in the blood and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years
they've not really given it attention either so it's not really cured it's not that heavily funded either and then that seems to be one of the major problems that men have in the realm of cancer so I don't know I guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to how they fund whatever illness they wish
it's kind of hard to get an even keel on that it's really hard to say there's a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and just keep doling it out that way or
I'm glad I'm not the one that's in charge of making those decisions you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious it's not so serious until it affects your family and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing
so I would hate to have that responsibility just personally but then again we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address I guess it frightens me to think of so many people with aids and with cancer and many of those things if they're not able to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other whether it's through prevention or treatment or just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves it seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it that's true
but the other thought that I had I've had several minutes to think about this after I while I was finding people I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it so it's kind of a unfair advantage as it were
but the other thing that I thought of on this is I wonder if there isn't enough money in our economy or in our system it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good they're kind of nice but we have such an affluent society that I wonder if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a cure for just about everything just change our of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's
just change our priorities a little bit
you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that are nice and aesthetic but are they that enhancing for the masses
they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
the general topic is hobbies
let's hear about your hobbies
let's see what kind of hobbies do I have? I guess it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing I enjoy playing basketball and basically all kinds of sports and any handicrafts? excuse me any handicrafts?
not really I'm really not too creative I around with my hands and things like that I leave that more up to my mom I think I'm in handicraft
I think it will become resume writing
let's hope that you aren't employed by that craft for too long I hate to think about it and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads it
what kind of time frame is it looking for the different shifts up there? I who knows
is it basically I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to mckinney texas all means about fifteen to twenty percent of
I'm sure the number's somewhere classified but some of the internal news and the news services so it's approximately six fifty
so ten percent of six fifty is sixty five and twenty percent would be one thirty
how about that that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to mckinney that's possible
how about that that's unfortunate is there many other are you in the defense?
is it many other corporations in the area? I saw seven eleven that was hiring
I'm sure with the new contract awarding I think it went to lockheed didn't it?
I hear they're hiring all over the place for that apple's coming to town and that has some opportunities and
is that ad good just to colorado or to colorado springs? colorado springs specifically
how about that and m c I s coming if telemarketing is your bag
personally I'd rather die a slow painful death but
you in the computer operations or in the actual manufacturing? I'm a defense worker I'm government tool control specialist
that's why I was in the deseg down here in plano also are you still employed?
am I still employed by t I I took a leave of t I back in november actually december was my first month away from them exempt or? exempt
unfortunately for myself it was purely by my own choice there was no incentive for myself to leave but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it so you didn't even get the severance package
I should have taken the option when that was there but it was just I missed it by a couple months but what can one do I'm just happy still to have a job are you happy with what you are doing now?
I am kind of happy with it it's getting better all the time I knew it would be different from the very beginning but as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system I was in the computer operations it all starts to become similar there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good
but as an overall package I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out it hasn't been a long time t I or I'm significantly shaken by the situation but not devastated
the one thing at least in your favor is the fact that that is more in the support of the manufacturing and there's lots and lots of companies that have to tell you the truth I'm not really worried
that's great that's good and I seem rather happy about it most of the time just to know what might happen sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table but still in all it feels funny it may be a blessing in disguise
I know a number of people who are surplused and they're just actually the positions that they found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside so despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains I can't seem to get into it right now
I'm sure it's just with the way that things are so topsy turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass situational I doubt I'll be here in six months
would you like to be there? I all things being equal
or even somewhere better
but this is much better than west texas
just take the day but then they tell me hell is much better than west texas
that whole area is actually quite nice my little brother lives in austin right now
that's a beautiful place goes to u t
that's just fantastic down there take it more as a this is your opportunity to do whatever you want pick out where you want to live and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do that's the problem for the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do and where I want to go and just kind of go with the punches and now I feel lost
that's a it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it I had job offers
but I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave and that
the best thing about it is that you can try something if you don't like it move on to something else that's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here I'll take a chance if I don't like it I'll go someplace else do something different had you been with t I long when you changed?
five years there's a noticeable difference there
I've been with them sixteen
I can imagine the longer and longer it goes actually seventeen now and momentum is uh driving force in our lives
so I'm looking as a opportunity
that's good you've got a good attitude about it and I'm looking at it as a change
and I'm looking at it as an adventure
there you go that's the way to do it and maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then
there you go that's the thing to do that's much funner than doing any kind of job how about we end this? that will work out just fine nice talking to you nice talking to you
since I initiated the call I guess I'll start off first number one I have absolutely no problem with random testing I spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and such I'd feel much more comfortable than I do now based on what I've been hearing in the newspapers so I really don't have a problem with it
I don't either I've never I don't work at home right now I stay home with my children but my husband works and they do have that at his place of employment and neither of us have a problem with it we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and such it's a scary thing to know that you just don't know what people are doing before they go to work
and the advertisements on television lately have been so there have been so many there's
just about train wrecks and things like that that I feel like probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things that would be something I'd like to know that's going on I happen to be my job is I'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company so it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs and we at the present time do not have random testing
and I am pushing towards that I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide they shouldn't have a problem with it
and if they are trying to hide something then I have to know that because we're talking major liabilities not only with themselves but with other employees
and I really they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that I would much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested on a random basis
I have a real fear that at some point something's going to happen and they're showing it with aids so why they ought to start doing something with the drugs so I really have no problem with it
it's unfortunate that everyone doesn't have that opinion I've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that but in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that
they feel that's not fair and whatever but those kind of things I'd like to know myself
it wouldn't be in my opinion I've had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all so
that kind of so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me that scares me because if that's the way they are I if I were a dentist I'd want to be protected too you would think so
that is because and I worked for a dentist and that's you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that and it's real real dangerous
I would think but with all the accidents just with everything happening with just airlines just drive me crazy people are afraid to fly now just because they don't know what their pilot's been doing and things like that and
I don't know where you're located I do know texas instruments has random drug testing
and I think they've had it for several years and their program they had I don't think had a lot of problems associated with it but my brother in law happens to work there and it sounded very positive and I think it's great I would encourage it I'm pushing our company towards that
and if they do find someone who is having a problem with drugs and they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on without any support and whatever
because a lot of people obviously are trying to hide that from their employer and friends and family and things
and too many people are just dying particularly in our area
I don't know what the crime is like where you are but the crime rate here is just astronomical ours is changing ours is changing it's increasing I live in a very nice suburb and it's unbelievable what's going on and the selling of drugs it's just too loose it's too free
I just got a piece of paper the other day that now they have these I have two very little children under two
and I got a piece of paper from my husband's office it's talking about these drug tattoos now that they have got
it looks like a sticker and it's for kid so what do you think about it?
I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in america and then went back and said if there is a problem what should we do about it? I guess that's so
do you feel there's a problem with immigration in america? I think there's some problems but they're not really big ones I think that in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be that it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to america it's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that
that's interesting I was wondering what your response would be I'm a first generation american
so I'm from immigrant parents or an immigrant mother anyway where did you come from?
so where did your parents come from? poland and
and that was prior to world war two
but it's interesting that with the topic I think I agree with you
there needs to be more of an open policy
and we have to remember the chinese came here and were our labor for the transatlantic railroad and our irish came and built the towns and did labor but what do you think are you from texas or I'm from pennsylvania pennsylvania
that will be interesting and a lot of
because we have just had a naturalization act where the mexicans that were residents in texas have become citizens now
what do you think about that? I think that's all right I at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing do you have an opinion about it?
I agree with it wholeheartedly
the only thing is I've got to share with you my background is from new jersey
so when you were giving your answer I was thinking is this a texan I'm talking to?
because texan philosophy is a little different
a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother in law who's chinese and immigrated from china and he got a green card and is in good standing in america and china but only because he was always nice to the chinese government and all that
and he was always on pretty good terms with them
we but their my sister just had a baby and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to america to help care for the kid and that sort of thing and it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem it's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of china even temporarily to visit here
then you have first in the experience on immigration that is interesting
I wonder even with those that were involved with tienamen's square
did we really protect them? and I think that's pretty crazy because those students who were in america when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back
and aside for that they're the best and brightest of china so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can
that is true that is true what do you think about
we have in texas a large vietnamese population that has been brought in
what do you think about that?
and these are not the brightest these are refujees you mean?
we're talking boat people
we have a lot of boat people in texas I don't have any problem with that
you're a true liberal heart to heart good for you I guess so
I was ready for a fight on this one I agree because
interesting when my daughter was in high school one of the custodians was vietnamese
and with his limited english they found out that he was a medical doctor are you there?
tell me your favorite team baseball?
I've kind of been intrigued with the rangers more so with their management than anything else I don't follow baseball that closely but since I live here so close to arlington that's the team that I've been kind of following I think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed so we'll have to talk about the future with the rangers
what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do?
I think that with so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's I think I'm not real sure about do you know anything about ruben sierra's I heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his
that he was willing to come down a little bit if the rangers will go up a little bit
and the rangers go up a little bit
but a little bit from thirty million dollars or thirty five that's a lot of money I think the entire baseball they're the ones that probably are paying the highest
they are and I think this is absolutely ridiculous
and I really think that they ought to I'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money I think they should pay him what his salary is going to be and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent that's right
and then who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him the six million dollars a year this year what I saw on the news today that buechele was back just to visit
I'm awful sorry he's not still
but what he that was a great deal for him I'm sure it was
it was a great deal for him and he just signed on I think it was a five year deal with pittsburgh pittsburgh
so he's real happy there as far as the rangers are concerned I think they definitely need some pitching
and so I what do you think of howse who is the coach for the pitchers? the pitching coach?
I was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a black guy that was helping out his assistant his assistant
and I think that's a great addition he seemed to know what he was doing and I really wish they could see fit to get rid of howse
you don't like howse? I really don't
and I'm not going to stand up on my soapbox and say that but I'm not fond of howse and I'm not fond of grieves tom grieve?
I'm not sure that they're ready to get rid of tom grieve yet but howse might be a different situation and I think you're probably right that they need some changes in pitching coach maybe and I'm just gullible enough that I think bobby valentine is doing all right and I'm sure you do?
that's contrary to popular belief I know I know so but I would like so much for these rangers to get their act together and give nolan ryan the support he needs
I know it's too bad that it has to be a forty two year old guy to lead the rangers I understand
they need to have some young guys that can take the lead and I have so many mixed emotions about all this but I think with their new stadium they should go and let
what do you feel is the major change that's been going on?
that's a tough question we are now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework
don't ask me I think that has been the major change is that women feel they need to go out and do this they no longer feel it's no big deal to stay home and raise your family any more
it has no credibility any more
I know it and I think that's really sad because I think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
I'm a school teacher and I'm in charge of raising them so I can appreciate it you don't
I'm still home with my last one and I wouldn't change a minute of it for anything
good for you good for you but I can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again
it's interesting because when I heard the topic I was thinking this summer oprah had a t v show about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible and one woman had four children
and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family that's
that's frightening it's sad
and from the audience participation it was almost a social issue
people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them
I think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary
that's true to I don't think the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and this type of thing I think that they would from the attention or whatever
that's true but it I don't know I see it as a major problem and I think it's going to have to swing back the other way because I think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
as I said I teach school
and I'm trying to think I don't know I have one mother that I know is home but she also has ten children what grade do you teach?
six seven and eight six seven and eight I've got a where do you live? are you out in richardson in richardson we're in plano here
I have a daughter in middle school and I know there aren't very many she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home but do you ever see problems that you feel that the kids are left alone too much and
I've got one child that stays with me every day until five because his mother doesn't come home until seven and he doesn't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself he stays at school?
and the school allows that? he stays with me
and I have a tendency to work late I work until six
so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home
and I have lots of kids because they know I'm there late
I'm a slow mover to say the least but they'll come in and say can I stay with you because I don't want to go home to an empty house and that's frightening because the when I said I'm raising them I am because we're talking about boy friends and we're talking about what the girl said in class and what's right because there's no mother at home no mother to talk to
and it makes a difference I and just the social values I've just do you feel it will swing back the other way or do you feel there's just going to be a big push for more and more day care type situations? I don't know
I have a feeling we're going to go more and more I've got a twenty one year old female and I've got twenty two year old male children and I listen to my daughter and she's going to work and she's going to buy her house and she's going to get her car and then she's going to have her children and then when they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their life style is
and they're back to work and I agree with you I was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things and we lived without them we did fine
what would you say your opinion is on gun control?
I don't know I've had mixed emotions when I listen to the radio and watch t v about the different things that are happening I'm against it but on the same token I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that
so I have a rifle in the house the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it but I bought it for target practicing and also because I wanted a weapon how do you feel about it? I think down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns
and I think they need that and I have a pistol it's a little twenty two and I have a twelve gauge shotgun
I do like to have my guns
I don't know if I'll ever use it and like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably about three years old my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two
but I like to have them handy
up in new england where I'm from you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition and I thought that was really good and I think if they
takes two weeks for that system to process your request to buy ammunition you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that I've never heard of anything like that
that would be nice but the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other I agree
I think one of the things that needs to happen is to stop the impulse buyer from buying it quickly and maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it
but if someone's really determined to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place
and you can get them really cheap I know I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in tennessee and they had a waiting period
and we bought it there and how long was the waiting period out there? about nine days
that wasn't too too bad
because if you're going to go buy something of that nature I think you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it you're not going to react that quickly in other words you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day somebody wants to do that at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms
I do too because it doesn't make any difference whether it's a pistol or a shotgun I suppose they both do the same kind of job a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does
I suppose I never got shot with either one but I don't know I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun a shotgun's got too much of a spread or at least ours does
it's you have a little thing on top of the barrel where you turn it
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get
and the spread changes
I've got a manual single shot and I guess it doesn't have any automatic features to it the further away I get the wider the shot gets from the target
and the closer that I get the tighter that it gets it's got a hell of a kick to it my husband had a police gun at one time and I shot that thing one time almost knocked me down
and it just a I forget I think it was a three fifty seven I'm not sure
do you belong to a gun club or you? he belonged to one awhile back since we moved we've only been here in texas for about a year
and we can't even find a place to shoot just for target practice no kidding I'd love to get used to that shotgun we traded his pistol for that shotgun
the clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive but it's well worth it you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have competition I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time not because I haven't got the desire there's an annual membership fee that's fairly high plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time member
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club plus you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in that's what my husband when he was in that gun club where he was doing that it he went mostly just to shoot at paper targets
but they used speed and accuracy and all that
I think that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose in fact I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon that's a good I've never thought of that that's a good point
and it even after you wait your nine days if you don't know how to handle it it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive and you give him a license because he waited nine days that's and
he could not only shoot himself he could mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it it we was living on a navy base down in memphis and this one guy decided to play lonesome cowboy or something and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
he was fortunate he could of hit something else he went tumbling down the steps along with shooting his foot almost off he broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things being mister cowboy
I can't remember what the term was going around it was about four or five years ago
but I guess that would be a good idea
about private citizens selling a weapons? like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me how do you feel about that? do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the buyer and the seller? or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system because you own it?
that's a hard one because we did that but I think there ought to be some rule against it I'll the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are going to come to you
isn't there a way to deregister yourself after you register a gun? I have no idea I've only had one gun
because I have and I've kept it the one gun that was in my name is it registered?
the rifle that I've got is not registered
and I don't know why I never registered it but the I don't think you have to register a shotgun
I think it's voluntary the my husband has a thing if they go to all right banning guns private citizens
this my kid is jumping on me I can't hardly talk my husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns
I guess that could happen it's just like the social security system once they gave everybody a number and now they're making you get one at birth
and once they have your number they have your identification
and if you try to do anything like not identify yourself to the government they know who you are and everything about you
and that's true I they know how much money you make a week to probably your my kid is banging I was seeing what they was banging on I've lost my train of thought I'm sorry
that's all right you were talking about what the federal government knows about people the
they probably know everything from half the time what time you go to the bathroom
they probably do that's a little bit extreme but they could know anything and everything about you and I'd like to have my gun if they go to banning them I'd lose my gun but we wouldn't lose our shotgun
and we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about but I don't
do you find it difficult picking up guns that are not registered?
I don't either I can buy some today if I wanted to just put up the money
you can look in the we got a thing down here called a shopper
it's a bargain thing you go and always see guns in there five to seven guns a day
it comes out every tuesday
and there's no waiting period on that none whatsoever you call we sold a refrigerator through it and it took us all of twelve hours
to sell the refrigerator?
and I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
and I think the federal government is really far away from control I don't believe in I shouldn't probably say control I mean regulation control is something that I wouldn't want the federal government to have but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons I agree with you there they do have too much control over us already
we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have
unfortunately we vote for the people who spend the money so I can't complain too much I guess so I don't know they're
ing seems to be a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to catch on or maybe a generation to two and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up it does seem to be a lot of habits to break I wasn't raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and we were doing all right there until the price dropped out and they weren't worth anything anymore
and we it took us almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in at the time it was still about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about a dollar it just really wasn't worth it
and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying
so they realized of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that was a big deal but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it and then t I started keeping up with cans there so occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there least it gets back into the system but as far as a habit at the house I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up have you all got the individual containers yet?
I read in the paper this week where maybe I don't know if it was I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time
but it should be starting probably in the next month if everything goes that I'm not sure all what we're going to have to do whether we have three separate containers I really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything it seemed like if I recall it's been a long time they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the big green containers
but seems like they said they were just going to have a bin and all different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as needed
it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than having a household try it
but I don't know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house
it would get messy too
I know other places when they recycle they have to wash out their glass jars and whatnot which we're not in the habit of doing that's true
I was brought up long time ago that they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the grocery store
and you'd get our money back and that was all well and good they don't seem to still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but I guess this day and age they don't
they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to break them
but they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day and
and they I think kids don't appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care they can get more somewhere else just a little bit of begging will
for a good they're the nickels the dimes or that they would get the kids just don't seem to care that that much about a small amount of money I wonder
but we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety nine cents so I would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before
it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat
so that's the main reason we sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles where do you take your cans?
as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer I guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't I think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a recycling place probably at one of the
what's your most recent one that you've seen?
actually what I do I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months
so I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater but I rent probably four or five movies a week I used to do that too but I haven't been doing it lately but
we've got a good video place out here and I'm just trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen air america I haven't seen that one
have you seen wild orchid? is it good?
it depends do you like steamy movies not I know that sounds funny coming from a woman but usually I don't
what type of movies do you like? action
I guess two of my favorite movies is probably lethal weapon and lethal weapon two
and those are two of my most favorite they're just really good movies and I liked bird on a wire and movies like that
do you like suspense movies or do you like just action or some like what do you mean are you talking about movies like die hard two
jagged edge jagged edge was a suspenseful one or fatal attraction I liked that that was pretty good
that was okay I guess I thought it was too far fetched but so many people said it wasn't but I guess
I hope I don't run across them that's true because I don't know I just didn't find that one to be real I just thought it was too far fetched
what was your favorite all time movie? I can't think off my head do you know which one yours was?
I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most that I was really the most in shock with was probably star wars that's
when that first came out I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that
out of all the movies I've never been as excited to go back I was ready to go back and see it again you're right about that but that's really an all time classic I don't think anything could ever beat that
I also liked gone with the wind or some of the classic like the lawrence of arabia I've never seen that
you haven't? should I rent it?
should I go rent it tomorrow
that's a real interesting movie and it's got a good historical perspective to it that's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school
so it'd probably be a good thing for me to see
actually I just saw a movie called the lost capone
and it's about al capone's brothers primarily one of his brothers
and I won't give the whole plot away but it's really a good movie al capone had three brothers
and one of them was lost for many many years and he turns out to be a law man
it's really interesting it you just gave it away I guess I can't go see it
that's okay I didn't give away the whole thing I just gave away just enough to get you interested that does sound good is it one I guess it's a rental
it is I may have to do that go see it or go rent it
and a lot of times what I wind up doing is picking an actor or an actress and seeing all
I've seen all of james dean's movies all of mae west's movies
and just kind of go out and rent all the movies and just kind of go I guess you could do that get all of david carradine's movies or segal
to what's his first name I can't remember his first name it's not david is it?
is it david segal I don't know he was on arsenio just recently I don't watch that
it was really kind of interesting because arsenio was asking him about what he thought of one of the other action guys
I can't even remember the name he said he wouldn't really talk about it didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a good action guy
it wasn't stallone it was I can't remember I can't remember the guy's name but I like all the rambo movies that's one side of the action that I didn't really care for but I don't really like sylvester stallone
I don't think he's really a very good actor I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful but I just have never been a stallone fan
adrian that's pretty good
like I say I just have I don't know I just have never seen any interest in him but
we actually rent probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films
don't watch really very many horror films at all I don't either
I don't know there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something coming out of the t v that just doesn't make my day you're right
it's so I guess I'm a realist and so when I watch movies like that it's this can not happen so I just don't enjoy it because it's just come on give me a break
I just and so many of them are done so poorly
it just doesn't even give you the effect some of them are done good and they do scare you but so many of them are just done real I don't know I'm not really into those
I just saw a really interesting movie called flatliners that was one of my favorites I thought that was a very good movie
I was really impressed with that one what I liked about it was that it was a new subject nobody had ever touched it before
and it was done so well it was just
it was just crazy enough for students might try to do it and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it that's probably true but it was a very good movie it was done real well too there wasn't any part of it that you really felt this can't happen it seemed real it was really good
that was one it's not my all time favorite movie but it was good it was really good
and I don't know if you like this kind but I thought pretty woman was a really good movie too
that was a great movie we've seen that two or three times we waited and we rented it
but it was really good
have you seen shrimp on the barby? I haven't I don't know if I've even heard of that one
it's got it must have what's his name in it it doesn't hogan? paul hogan I'm surprised
it's got cheech marin that must be pretty good then was it good
it is it's kind of a poor man's pretty woman in reverse
but it was kind of cute actually did you see dirty rotten scoundrels?
I though that was a really cute movie I enjoyed that it was twins was good too because when I thought of that I thought of there was another one what's the one that just dances with wolves have you seen that yet?
I haven't you've got to see that one it's really
I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video that's probably true that's probably true it's very very good very good
that's another one that I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it
my wife has got a picture from kevin costner and he signed it it's from dances with wolves
and he signed it he happens to be a friend of one of her business associates or not a friend a cousin that's impressive
but we got a nice picture and it came in an envelope that says dances with wolves so we've got to try to get out there and see that one it's really worth it it's a very good movie and I would suggest seeing it at the theater I know that they're still playing it and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until august
I think because they were scheduling a video release of it in july and then when it won all those awards they pushed it back to august so but that one is definitely worth seeing it's really good
did you see driving miss daisy? and I didn't think that one was near as good
I guess it was okay it was all right but when I compare the winners of this year and last year it just I don't know maybe it's not
have you grown up in dallas stephanie?
I've only been here for the last ten years where are you from? I grew up most of my childhood in germany in germany and
we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance there's a place I'd like to visit
so we travelled all over europe when I was very young unfortunately a little bit too young to really appreciate that's neat
I was grade school age my husband took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war and so we've seen lots of pictures of the beautiful spots and areas
that would be to me a really nice vacation because I'm not in physical shape for something like that but I sure would work on it if I had an opportunity like that
that's neat what kind of vacations do you like?
my husband and I are scuba divers
so we both like to go to dive resorts we went to hawaii on our honeymoon
and we dove there but we did about six dives while we were there and we were originally planning on going to cayman last year
but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip we had to have eleven people for this package deal
and we couldn't get enough people together to go so it ended up falling through
we were going to get a really good price when our children were younger we lived up in new jersey and used to like traveling into upstate new york and camping
and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing but we've never really did any diving or anything little bit of water skiing snorkeling?
but not much of anything else
my husband and I both like water
so any vacation that we go on is usually close to the ocean or something like that it's got to be the water
when we were in jersey we used to go down to the jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot they had a really nice beach areas there
after we moved away from germany we moved to new hampshire
and I lived there for seven years I see
and I really enjoyed that because the mountains were real close that's a really pretty area too
we like the white mountains and unfortunately I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there
I went skiing once we loved the new jersey area too because the lakes were really pretty close you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and just really
and then we weren't too for from the appalachian trail we did quite a bit of hiking which is kind of fun are you a hiker or not? not so much?
not really so much if there was some place that we went to where there was hiking involved I would be happy to go hiking
but we never have really planned a vacation around places to go hiking so your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive
our next vacation will be scuba diving I'm sure you have any children?
not yet then that's probably one of the reasons our we had little children all the time
so some of the things are not quite as adaptable
it's a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have children it is you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too and so I think
and diving is something that especially for small children I think the minimum age for diving would be probably about sixteen eleven or twelve I would think probably but maybe fifteen even
I know that one thing that happens to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family we go wherever somebody is that we haven't seen for a while
so that's kind of we just came back from grand rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate with his master's degree in social work
and so that was fun and the summer we have a reunion in salt lake area up by park cities where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of a rather large reunion group as we can get together so
that sounds like a lot of fun
our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too
that there were several hundred people and they all kind of met at a central place I didn't go
but it would have been a nice vacation we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe like a small camper
we've travelled in a big one I hate them because they're hard to jockey around but maybe a pickup with the back on
or something like the volkswagen vanagon I've heard is really nice so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes but you wouldn't want to do it all the time
we have enough friends here and there I would just love to just drive through the united states and stop and see people I know and visit for a day and then go on and
my dad has been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel and just picking up he's retired
he's in his sixties and he would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just not be settled anywhere
I think that would real
just see the rest of the country and I would like to maybe not take great long trips but have your home base where your home is and then just travel out for maybe a month maybe go
he does that quite a bit and
he hasn't lately though because he's been ill
but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time and he'll say this is my itinerary I'm going here here and here and I'll be back in about two months there are a lot of neat places to visit in america that's for sure I haven't been much to the south I haven't been in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama I guess those are the only states I have not visited but up the coast in maryland and around there where the early history is there's some johnstown and in that area is just really neat interesting things to so
have you been to a lot of the different historical sites? we took a trip around to the civil war battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something
I believe it was had about three kids then I think but that was a really fun interesting trip we read bruce book before we went and so we were ready to look up the places we read about
I think right now while my husband and I don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and adventurous types of things it was really interesting
and then eventually when we have kids
his folks did a lot of traveling across country they went to the grand canyon and did things like that camping is fun with kids if you're
once they get a little bigger not teeny tiny ones but even some little ones do pretty good but when they get a little bigger they can help
that's a fun way to cut costs and it's enjoyable too very restful I find
I do enjoy camping I find the outdoors very relaxing and kind of a change
as long as I have a shower nearby I'm fine and electricity
I'm with you I need my creature comforts too
it was great to talk to you
it was nice talking to you too beth see you later
and that's an idea that's been kicked around for a long time I don't know that it's ever been seriously considered as far as close to passing any legislation or anything like that but I believe israel does that for their
I think so everybody has to do something
I don't or maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone but
I believe that's right
and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about I don't think it's I think of that it couldn't be military service is not that much but the military used to do it but the idea that there are things that do need to be done that could be done and then country would benefit from one year from everybody and even out the requirement
for kids in high school it could be in the summertime that's a thought
it could even be done while they're doing another job while they're doing a job to make money
but it's such a grassroots idea that it I think the family would have to be involved in it
and people would have to be convinced that I think the basic message is that giving is better than receiving
and that's not the kind of society we have right now I'm afraid you're right there but anything like this that came up whether it it quickly would be significant industry in figuring out how to get around it where people
there's lots and lots of volunteer programs but at least it's my opinion that most of those involve adults adults who have the time to give and the desire to give
it's not maybe it younger people feel like it's not open to them I don't know but it should be if it's not I suspect that that's not the thing that they don't feel it's open to them it's just that they are more self centered and not considering a voluntary
it is kind of an introspective time of life
but some high schools have actually started a visitation program to less advantaged areas
and they promote service on the part of the kids to some of those people so at least that's a step in the right direction I guess and I don't know it I think you're right that that's not the way that the society these days is going and I think we need to try to figure out some way to turn that around that everybody
it's really unfortunate because when you do I do volunteer work for the american lung association
and I have gone to work for american heart and for the leukemia society and there's no question that doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than the people involved
it's really a gift to yourself and I think that's a really important lesson to learn
and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not really happy that could be
because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you're just kind of down the tube
it really is better to give then to receive I agree with that and I don't know what has set it off or what but it certainly seems to me that in the last twenty three years things have definitely gone towards very much the concentration on self and loss of perspective in terms
I'll just go with you first what kind of eating out do you enjoy?
I like dining out of course it means that I don't have to cook
but I'm a divorced woman I have one child
and when we dine out we go to medium priced restaurants
I don't particularly I think it's sort of a waste of money to go to a real high priced restaurant do you go home cooking like black eyed pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria? not really
we go more for the chinese and italian and stuff like that mexican stuff that I can't cook me too mexican
we do too we do the same
what are your favorite places? I like chinese food
there's a little place down on coit road chinese pavilion or something that is really good
and I like it and I do like chinese buffets we've gone to august moon and we think that was real good
but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to taiwan or may dragon
and those are excellent they're really a nice place you could take someone to eat
it's not the rinky chinese decorations
but it's a very elegant nice place to eat
very often we go out for fajitas that's my husband has just gotten stuck
and we go to on the border and lots of places that have
and some of those and get fajitas and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back
and then last weekend we went out for italian also and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread
so we went to el sorrento
have you ever tried pappasito's? it was fun
you know what? that's real funny you said that because we were coming back sunday on central from church and bob pointed to it and he said I keep hearing good things about that place we're going to have to go
it is delicious that's what he in fact you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that
so I guess we'll have to do it
it's you always stand in line when you go that's what but it's worth the wait d magazine said that it said there was always a line
but that's a good sign
and have you ever tried the macaroni grill up on we did my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna
and most of those things were a little more northern italy
and they like just the traditional they're not very
they're the spaghetti warehouse type they are
the place of the seventies
but my little girl likes spaghetti warehouse real well most kids do it's real entertaining for her do you ever go for steak? just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing
not really a steak is something that I cook at home that you grill out
and I really don't particularly I'm real curious to try this one that has such commercials that del lincoln and what is that guy's name? they do those real corny commercials
there's one over there in addison I can't remember his name anyhow it's some
steak it's some famous steak place over in addison there's a second one downtown and they have these really corny radio commercials
but their steak is supposed to be wonderful so I had not tried that my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie
and it seems like I've been we found those one time and then they discontinued it was over in addison
and then they closed up
so most of these places are pretty much just theme restaurants around here
I think that's what really goes right now in the dallas area
of course next to downtown up around mckinney and everything there's a different class of restaurants up there that I can't even touch that's exactly true that's right
that's right that's right
it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there that's that's right
but I had a friend who was taken to lawry's downtown for prime rib
and I haven't been we usually don't go for beef really anymore
where we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna
when I go out it's normally to get some specialty type of food
besides chicken and steaks and everything I grill at home I know I understand
and really they're a lot better than what I get in the restaurant that's right and save you some money too that's right
saves you a little bit money what's your child's favorite place to eat?
favorite place she has a lot taco bell they're easy that's right
that's right mine enjoy that too they like to go pretty much where we like to go and they'll
and then our favorite thing on fridays we generally order pizza in so not pizza inn but pizza to our house
so we've done is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it?
not that I know of I think it's come to an eye conclusion so I'll talk with you later thank you thank you so you have a child two years old in child care right now we
two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and finding what we consider to be real good child care at a pretty reasonable price
how about you do you have any children? our first and he just turned three months
so we're just starting into hunting for child care
right now both of us are students
are you? where are a student?
university of southern mississippi no kidding she's
I was a professor in a university here in california for a while
are you going to put your son in child care in a year or two? probably actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care five days a week more than likely depending on how my class schedule runs
because my wife will be doing her internship that semester
it will be forty hour week eight to five type of thing
so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point right now we're trying to avoid it but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a girl to watch him I get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home
so for about twenty thirty minutes a day we got a baby sitter comes in
that's a good experience I think and there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good
and they kind of boil down to any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
and what we found to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving
and that's more important than anything else we could have sent her to a fancier facility
she goes to a home this is a couple emigrated from china early in their lives
they've been here probably thirty forty years
they've got three daughters and they have a loving home
and they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
so it's a good experience that makes a big difference
if it's good I think it's very good for the child and if it's a loving environment I think it's very good
and and that's really what we've learned about it she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
but we feel real fortunate and we were able to just choose in the marketplace I don't know what it's like around hattiesburg there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with their home ec department I'll bet they're involved
they have a subbranch american family counseling and their people staff the child care center just off campus but they have a pretty good size waiting list so
that's I know it's a real hard thing to do even for people in university communities
out here at manford they have a real good facility and there is quite a waiting list to get into that
so it's an important decision
it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
and I think this really is buyer beware it's best
a cottage industry's the best way to do it really
it is the best way to do it interestingly because if you over
I think that my own interest in human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn
because I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that professionally because I believe that there are pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care
primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life
and it's amazing how much good things like sesame street will do it's phenomenal
it's phenomenal the human operating system
hal what's crime like in dallas?
it depends where in dallas you are
there are certainly parts of town I would not want to live in
because it's the situation it is very location dependent
and there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire in baltimore we have similar I live on the outskirts of baltimore and we live right outside the city and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though I'm in graduate school I live here because it's close to the university
but we have it's really funny the only crime we really see is just the kids being malicious
and I think most of that is because their parents aren't around that make sense?
what they call the latchkey children something like that no one's or fathers are just missing so there's no consistency there in the home or whatever there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong
sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class so I think our
not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems
but on the other hand we get the affect of the city and the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes a small number of assaults
if we have one murder a year that's probably as many
but then you go into dallas and they are unfortunately having murders at a rate greater than one a day
I think we're about the same in baltimore though washington is close by and they experience a lot more
I think they definitely have more problems in the area what do you think can prevent crime?
the thing is I don't it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on
unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like wherever there are more criminals there are more policemen
but that's which came first
but on the other side of it is basically the problem is in the society and the society's views
and since now I'm in my mid forties when I was in grad school or when I was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area I thought crime was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the drug aspect of the pushers the dealers and the addicts I think
I think I agree with you there
because it just was not something back in the sixties that I even had to worry about
but I think that there is a lot in the society where things have changed so it's effected all of us I think the drug culture definitely is one of the main problems our mayor in baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should legalize drugs because it would eliminate the violence and the market the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it
that make sense? he's one of the big proponents of that he gets on national television and says that so it's and he was a district attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming mayor so that's a really it's a different viewpoint I
in a sense I have real mixed feelings on that
because it comes a bit from the angle that the it would certainly be an interesting test but the other side of it to me what happens if we lose worse
the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side and I think if I look back fifty or a hundred years I'd say back then there were the opium dens
but the thing is if somebody ruined their life society didn't try to then save themselves from it they let this person who had ruined it die or whatever
they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have physically ruined themselves they have induced it themselves that's true
and so to me that's I would certainly like to see a real test of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them
I think they did that in alaska that actually alaska just recently legalized marijuana
but I never heard results or anything like that so I never plus it really couldn't be a good test because alaska's so different than every other part of the country
but that was interesting I don't crime is one of those things that's I don't know the drug culture the I see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it
some of that and of course I'm a baby of the old school
but it bothers me from the fifties on not that I'd remember that much from the fifties
but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality that's true that's true we worked hard for everything that's very true and so they
in the there were the sixty four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties but nowadays there's so much on tv where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing of course I work for lawyers a lot
and I see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and there's a million dollars you can have for mental duress or whatever
but the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the in europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable
and if you're going to drink you better have your designated driver
in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds the punishment is extreme and we mean it
I think that the drunk driving has actually just caught on and I really
my father was hit by a drunk driver when I was in high school
and that was an awful three years afterwards of recovery and the difficulties and everything we did
and the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago
there was no his father was even the police chief of the town
so there was no repercussion at all other than insurance but he was uninsured
so our insurance paid for everything but it was a very difficult time and then later my brother and I were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a new car and somebody had taken a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and dented it everywhere
and they came and questioned us and
but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was misplaced for years
it was an acceptable social behavior very much so those are some important points I those are
what does your city have for gun control if anything? maryland is one of the most we just voted in strong gun control here in the state of maryland I think
while I was waiting for you to connect I thought of a couple of menus so I decided it had to be in it informal or not if it's informal I'd probably choose something just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it's so nice out
if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something I'm not into formal dinner parties but I'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread I see
so what do you use for cookbooks? I have a pillsbury cookbook I got when I was married but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me
then I have some from church that are more family recipes that are more useful budget cookbooks
and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up
I cook a lot the same as my mom did of course I've added several different recipes but what would you
I think we come from different backgrounds so the that's good
I so it have different perspectives that you are I find the joy of cooking to be a remarkably useful book to fall back on
because it has almost everything in it but on the other hand it's not very inspiring it's a good reference when you need to dig something up
what we've found very useful is a book called the thirty minute cookbook by marion burroughs
which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes the whole meal and so she's that would be wonderful in these times
I find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes either they're really fast or
they're interesting combinations that nobody thought of
what's one of your favorites?
the one I had most recently was one that she describes as jim beard's favorite summer menu or something and it consisted of grilled kielbasa sausage a potato salad with olive oil and some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there sounds too good
that's certain you can do in thirty minutes
but there are a whole lot of I would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person that thirty minute cookbook
thirty minute cookbook that sounds fun I find a lot of the cookbooks that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things I don't keep on hand all the time
and I have young children and our budget's set at this time but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand
I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of
that's why sometimes I shy away from more of a traditional cookbook
but it was interesting talking to you it's a fun subject food is one of my favorite things too
anything else you wanted to add?
you had said dinner what would I put together for a formal dinner we had some friends over as recently as saturday night
and put here the inspiration was a combination of julia child for the dessert a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella which is this wonderful thing you can do that's good
basically you're baking chicken in an open pan having marinated it first and my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details
marinated in olive oil and some seasoning and cooked with some olives and some prunes there's a little bit of brown sugar in there and it bakes up and it's a delicious thing and it's easy that sounds good
comparatively so I'm sorry that sounds really good I just love it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am I'm pretty simple right now but
maybe a little more leisure time to do it
I don't know that's true I have little ones and they won't eat too many different foods right now
I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes
there again sometimes it was easy they'd canned ravioli was one of their favorites and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so
and it goes a long ways too
nice talking to you cheryl
talk to you later maybe I said arlington texas because the other day I was talking with somebody and he was in arlington virginia
that's the only one I've got now for this area
anyway we've got a easy subject
we do you go ahead first if you'd like let me think here
favorite I haven't been watching much t v lately you get so busy I used to
I have one favorite soap opera I still watch and I tape because I'm not home
and let's see that's general hospital and then at night when I sit down I don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed I know
and then I watch what do I watch at nine o'clock let's see tuesday nights I guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like
and are they little?
I have a seven year old and a ten year old they're pretty young
so we usually catch full house and what's the one comes on after that it's a new one I don't know my kids are older
so I don't know some of those shows now like I used to
other than that I watch knots landing on thursday nights for pure entertainment nothing else
I like the comedies they're just light too I have to watch murphy brown I really like
now that is a good one I make a point of that that is
if I'm home on mondays then I definitely watch her I love that and I really like coach I think when it's good it's just a scream
he's a good actor he really is good he's probably playing himself half the time you see these people on an interview show they act just like they do in their parts
he I saw him on johnny carson once and he acted about the same
he could very well be and
do you watch much t v or I watch more now because I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy
but this semester I'm only taking one course and so I see murphy brown and coach and the wonder years I just make a point of seeing those
I never see that I've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show it's fabulous really you should never miss that they are just gems of shows they really fabulous in every way nice
what night is that on now? that's wednesday at seven thirty
wednesday at seven thirty wednesdays I go to church choir so that's my one night out and about
so maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime
I should get him to do that because I know just so you get the idea it wouldn't take much to get hooked on those I watch those
are there any new ones this year that came out that you like or I haven't we started watching northern exposure it's not really new but it's still kind of new
how's that? I haven't seen that I like it a lot it's real different in fact they never thought it would be a hit
they'll have some things in there almost supernatural or something somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does or it sounds weird but it's very unique show and very well done excellent actors
I'll have to watch for that I guess we just it came on after something we used to watch
and I guess we just kept sitting there and now we make a point of watching I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television
then it will be mostly reruns I guess
and by the end of february the way they do it nowadays
we used to watch a lot of designing women but
but I haven't seen that much lately since they got rid of delta burke and brought on the new ones I've seen that
was she the best one? was she the best one on that old show? she was just funny
she was really funny and her character was good I don't know that it was her in particular but just the character
so they had a big fight on that show didn't they?
they were all accusing each other of everything in the world
that was awful and who knows still what really happened I know you never will probably
so I think the latest soap opera for people is the kennedy trial for those who have cable
I know I don't have cable
I told we don't have that station either so I haven't been able to catch any of that but just what little we caught on the news it's just as wild as any soap opera from what I hear on the news
I know it and I think he's guilty as the devil
I don't see how he couldn't be I know what's in it for her there's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers that's right
and they said this lawyer is unbelievable but they said she held up so well yesterday I know everybody was saying that and then in the paper said it so it should be interesting
the national enquirer says
I was reading that in the supermarket line I never have the nerve to buy the thing
do you watch any sports or anything like that says he
or I don't care anything about that
because I don't either I can't watch it on t v so I like the ice skating occasionally some ice skating will come on on a sunday or during the olympics
I always watch that I think it's so beautiful
I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes too that's good
I've got a I have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing and then that's get rid of the half of the government payroll
I think that would probably be very possible
and we really wouldn't feel it in our services not all I don't know if you've ever been to washington d c
I have you've seen that which was on there and the offices and in light of these hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed
they really don't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses in their own business of what they're doing
and the other thing is besides that I think two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid I have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us
I find that a total waste and part of the defense budget again being just a voter and a taxpayer working through our congressman I don't think there's too much that I'm going to be able to do about it but I believe in taking an active part in politics so
I one thing that really bothers me beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes and the regular normal taxpayers are paying such a large proportion of our personal income
and then the corporate industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally
I think that that would help a lot I guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things but I don't know it's just hard to take and see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use
and seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from that direction but they don't seem to I really think the biggest problem and then the taft rudman act is supposed to help that the biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing
this nonsense that's coming through now about lowering payments on social security and a few other things that bush has in mind in order to boost the economy because people have more money it's ridiculous
if they don't have that money now bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government not going to help
it's never helped my personal situation I can't say it would help with theirs either
and thank god we don't operate our budget the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in dire trouble
but that's I don't know what we're going to be able to do about it but I guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages I don't ever expect to pay mine off before I die so why should the government isn't that's the way they're thinking these days anyway
it seems to be I it really does bother me when I think about leaving our children with this sort of a national problem that we can't seem to find an answer to it I don't know I don't think it ever will really I maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense
if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might
I believe in paying my share and I don't mind paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to but I just sometimes feel like I'm being used but again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it so
that's quite possible I guess we have to keep plugging away a little bit or it will just totally get even more out of control but I don't know bite the bullet it sounds like you have a baby there I do
she's a we're not feeling too well over here so that
that's a shame she's not the one going to washington? she's
I don't think I could part with her geri we've probably been on long enough
they didn't cut us off but I think that will probably do it so it was nice talking to you there we go
I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year I think that's true the bermuda grass is greening up in march and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of april so I think we're a little ahead of schedule on that
I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and I noticed all that grass coming up and I thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon that's true it's been a fun break but the break is over
I guess another thing I've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days it's been awfully gray just the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny
but it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend I go for that
in fact I'm a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not
I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest will be without rain that's good
but I think the highs are going to be in the sixties and the lows in the forties that's getting back to a little bit chillier that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year I think I haven't seen the weather on the news in the evening lately but I think the average high should be about seventy
I'm not certain either but you're probably right
I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature maybe seventy five to eighty somewhere in there I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature that's true one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesn't vary very much
you're probably right any other time of year that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold
as a matter of fact I heard the weather the other day on t v and I think it was one day this week a year ago
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather
it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the late spring time
one of the weirdest things I saw was a twenty six degree lightening storm
I was going into the grocery store and a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead and it was six degrees out
and I thought I've never known it to lightening at that temperature
that is pretty unusual and you really take notice of it too that's right it probably was a lot warmer up high sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees
the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away
I don't like that super cold stuff
I just don't move very well when it's that cold I'm really enjoying this now this has been interesting
not too challenging to the brain
not a real in depth topic but enjoyed talking to you
ellen you have a good day
the question was about physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise
I don't do it as much as I should I try to walk
and last year I did it every day but in ninety one I've kind of gone down hill
and so I'm not doing it as much as I need to but I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better and so much healthier I agree
but it's just to get motivated to do it and once I get started I do it every night
it's just to get motivated again and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again and I was walking and it got kind of dark
and I was by myself and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block
so I kind of got frightened and I kind of use that as an excuse all I have to do is start earlier but I haven't walked since so it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise I know what you mean
it sure is it sure is how about you? do you exercise on a regular basis? I try to I started at the beginning of this year I decided I'm going to start exercising again I'm going to be real good and I went through the t I fitness center and registered for the aerobics classes there
and they run for two months at a time and you do have to pay to take them and I signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half so that was four and a half hours a week
and it cost sixty dollars and I thought that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money
and I had a friend of mine going so I was real good I only missed it about three times and then march came around and I signed up again and I got caught up with a class I was taking at t I and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class
and then I went to colorado springs the next week to do some training at the t I up there and so that was two weeks I had missed and I tell you what I've been terrible ever since then
it's once you get out of that habit you don't get back into it
because I teach school and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class we went in together and hired a private instructor and she came to our school twice a week
and I was I would go faithfully and then I missed once
then I went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again
I think you just have to stick with it I think I've been two maybe three times the month of april and this session is about to run out now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes and some of them require me to go out of town
and that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that and I've
lately there's been nights that I could have gone and I've found excuses things like I had the flu last week
but I'm fine this week I could have gone monday I could have gone tonight and I didn't
so I'm kind of finding excuses and now it's kind of this is the last week I'll just start fresh next week but I better do it and I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months she started taking tennis lessons and so I haven't had that extra motivation of us encouraging each other to go so
that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same thing
it's misery loves company I don't really love exercise some I the neighbor across the street she belongs to president's and it's not president's any more I don't know what the name of it is anymore but she loves it
it's an automatic high for her
she just enjoys it so much and I don't I'm the same way
I feel good after I do it but I hate it when I'm doing it
I just I don't enjoy it at all and she just loves it so even when she doesn't go to the health club she runs
and it's a daily thing for her so it and it's so hard for me I envy her I wish I could be that way but I don't I do too
and I have an older sister that loves running too and she runs all the time but to me it's every minute's agony and I in fact I don't run I hate to run
when I walk I'll take along a radio or something and that helps pass the time walking is kind of boring I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood and we used to try to get together and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex
and it's not as boring if you get several people
that's right and you can kind of talk and it makes it pass pretty quickly and the aerobics isn't too boring I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do I guess
but I do have to make myself go and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good and after I get finished I feel great
it's great afterwards I can go in there I can be a friday afternoon when I'm tired it's the end of the week and I just want to go home and I'll make myself go and I'll have headache and everything and I get out I don't have a headache any more I feel great and I'm just it's amazing how much better I feel
and then just in general I sleep a lot better
that's right and I just feel much better I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better it does it gives you energy but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising
I'm too tired or I have a headache or
I just got over the flu and I'm still kind of draggy so I better not go
it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it? it really is
I find too that I have more energy when I exercise and it's silly not to but I don't know it's just a put off I don't know why I don't do more and I know that it's good for my health I know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
so you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life so
there's no reason that we shouldn't do it but I don't know it's just hard to make yourself go and I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night and I've been sweaty and it I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands
so it kind of kills the evening for doing errands so I think a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better
of course I feel like once I've done it if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes because you've already kind of shot your night
but so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on thursday now that I can just kill two nights and get a reasonable amount of workout in
does it cost the same for just two nights or it's less expensive
that's good too this one was only forty five dollars but I'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more probably
since it's more expensive I think you spent that much money you'd better go that's right that's right so hopefully
do you have a facility right at where you work? it's right there and they have a really nice facility at the t I they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but I guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going but
and then they hire private instructors?
that's great and they have ceiling fans in the rooms and it's a pretty nice setup and of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere I'd never make it
and just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the recreation center and do it helps a lot
I can see that would be easy they make it as easy as they possibly can for you
do a lot of people take advantage of it? quite a few do they have probably fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running and they have them anywhere from six in the morning they have some during lunch hour that are shorter and I guess guys can take advantage of that for me I wouldn't have time to do an hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get dressed again
but there's a lot more guys that do that one
and they have them in the evenings they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that so they have big variety they even have some water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool I've never done that one before but
you have a pool there too?
how nice they've got an olympic pool and basketball courts and sand volleyball they've got the full weight room and the locker rooms with a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and everything you'd need just about
it is a real nice facility it's also got a full inside basketball court and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things but it is very nice that's great I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should
to use I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing but
does it cost money to exercise in the weight room or to go swimming do you have to pay for that too you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities and it's about eight dollars a month
that's not bad not at all pretty cheap
and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership but I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what I've heard
I think so too and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?
people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics? in fact the t I er's families can come in on these things
I missed a part of it we're to talk about what lawns and gardens?
lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do I'm a putterer I chose that topic because I really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard
I it's very strange that I got this call because my wife just called me I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden
this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall bulbs
we've had a late fall it seems like the weather in fact today it's really warm and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up but you need to pretty soon that's the way this was the petunias were really great our mums are beautiful
I don't think we've had a frost up here I was down in for a week so I don't know what happened last week
but I don't know if it's late I'm sort of waiting for indian summer so I can get a lot of stuff down out here
I enjoy it we moved in in november and put all the landscaping in this year we came from nine years in a condo and working in that condo you didn't have to do anything unless you really wanted to so
now you have the chance to really create and spread out
I can't this is my third house I've owned but it's interesting the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it
but I enjoy most of it and about this time of year it starts getting a little old and I start looking forward to having other things to do with my the grass not growing so fast
it is for me because I've been doing a lot of fertilizing we had a terrible summer we had a drought
and took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing and now it's really growing and I'm trying to establish a good root growth for the winter
ours seems to have slowed down here we're not having to mow every week religiously
but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the summer flowers out
I still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
but today it's eighty five degrees
it's really strange I hear that from my brother in law lives in plano
but that'll change real quick he always we'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here and then he calls us
it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine so
texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot
and we have ice storms every year and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes
some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings that is I was conditioned to it
they have to be hardened to it that's strange with me you think dallas almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of problem but
for the most part we don't but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter
but the ice storms really are stressful on all the plants that we have around we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to and pittosporum do they
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time
you really take a chance with them freezing I love
I love the landscaping like I say my brother in law I get to carrollton quite a bit
I go there on business and I really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens and dallas is very nice I really enjoy it there the landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing very enjoyable gardens and my wife and I
except for the lack of trees out where we are it was all cotton fields
and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it that we have
ohio's a very pretty state in seventy six we moved to chicago we lived there for five years and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said there's no trees down there this is illinois you're not and when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land
and now all of a sudden it was being developed and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees
it seems to me that I do not know whether the jury system I should not say I do not know I do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed it seems to have worked time immemorial and when difficult decisions are made they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on
I know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code a unanimous verdict is not required and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people they are down to as small as six people in minor felonies and misdemeanor trials
I think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because there is always a jury that might be swayed by the moment either to be too lenient or too vengeful I guess
on the other hand justices are more apt to understand the prison crowding problems and things like that and have that sway their decisions one way or the other
but is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world?
if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences and the people in various states it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even repair the lack of judges and other
I think that is what is happening I think the judges are trying to save the people from having the cost of new prisons
they that might be it they certainly
they are saying the people can not afford it
I don't know how it is in virginia
but in florida now someone was just sentenced to eighteen years without any specific recommendation for waving the normal procedures and the eighteen years will translate into something like four point seven if the prisoner is a model prisoner
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions prevail plus I guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial
so you might be right about that I do not know it just seems to me that only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway
and only about four or five percent of in the very end or less than half the cases that go to trial end up with the jury actually making the verdict with a conviction?
that most of it is plea bargained half way through or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway
but how do you feel about the jury system itself? do you think that should be changed? or do you know in virginia if they have smaller juries or
I do not know exactly what the size of the juries I know one of my friends was brought up for jury duty
for and he only heard very piddly type cases most of it was robberies or things like that it was not any serious crimes so apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person any felony I guess we
they give the person the option for a jury I guess we always focus on criminal trials with the jury but I know you have a right to ask for a jury in any sort of a case where damages are the result of some sort of an action that you are bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury
takes a heck of a long time to get there in some states
I do not know I should imagine virginia from what I read is like every other state it is faced with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system because everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges
not that they won't appoint them but there is no budget for them I guess and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the court clerks
whatever so it seems I do not think I would change it the more I verbalize it I do not think I would want to change the system
I do not know what we would replace it with
I do not think I would either
I know it does seem like the purpose of getting people in jail so that the I can not think of the word I am looking for anyway the deterrent for people to not commit the crime is sort of gone away
people have I do not know they just do not care any more the benefit of crime outweighs what the deterrent is and yet there are so many people in prison
people that the prison population as far as I my impression of it is that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty
I mean it I guess our population has grown some too but there definitely is to me one of the worst things that could ever happen from what I read and see and understand I do no think I could handle prison
it would be very difficult
I would be interested in finding out what the percentage of drug related type things are
there must be a very great degree of that and
but there again I do not know if the jury system itself comes in to play there I would think that one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability of course it is a constitutional right that the press must have here is the interviewing of jurors after the trial it seems to me that when a jury makes a decision they should not be asked before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision I do not
I imagine there is a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that but I would think if I did anything I would protect the juror from any sort of an inquisition after
I know on the other hand though after the barry trial up here the big local trial as well as national
I do a lot of business up in washington
I was there during the trial actually
and the opposite was true of me after the case was over I was somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did
it was a picture is not good enough we want to see I do not know what they wanted honestly did they want the guy to I do not know just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was I no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted I felt that way I felt but it does not matter
the guy was obviously guilty but
I always balanced in the situation I remember the jurors I thought to myself how did I think they only found him guilty on one count which was a class something felony which was not even punishable to the degree that they thought it one count
but I do not know maybe when you are there in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody and the prosecutors do a lousy job or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it I am not making excuses for that might be it
I think we are getting I think I am getting a call coming in
nice talking with you
it has been nice talking to you thank you
what do you do this weekend?
pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard which is what do you have planned for your yard?
we just bought our house last july and the house is forty years old so there's an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that but they've gone a few years of neglect
so we're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation we've got different flower beds in front and a built in window box trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up get rid of a few weed problems and things like that
what part of the state do you live in?
I live in dallas my wife and I we live in dallas too so
just what that area we're planning on moving to flower mound and we're going to be getting some wheel we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there
seems like it the place we've been living at we're just leasing it in plano the soil has such a high clay content that I went to use my dad in law's tiller and it about for my arms off sockets I'll bet
I'll bet just scratching two or three inches was just a chore
it was it was and then when it gets wet you don't even want to get out in the yard it's horrible
it's a nightmare but I don't know what where you live is there a real high alkaline or ash content or
it's pretty high actually it's done it's in the north end of oak cliff in kessler park area
and we've got about I know right where that's at
we've got maybe eight inches to a foot of soil
and then it's solid rock from then on down so
it's a little aggravating we can't put in anything too big as far as shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the cracks in the rock
but is it limestone underneath?
it is it's solid limestone how do you put trees in there?
we're just happy that there's trees already there so far
anything like that is a major undertaking I guess sprinkler systems or anything start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock but and it not even considering a pool or anything like that practically has to be blasted in I guess
but and it makes for a different challenge I've never I moved to dallas about five years ago
and I never really messed with anything gardening or anything like that until now but I keep hearing all the stories of different parts of town in fact we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
and the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said I've got a dozen different varieties and each one works in one part of town and that's it that's basically what he was trying to tell us we tried planting tomatoes last year and they turned out pretty poor
I just wish I'd known the variety and everything
it but it's amazing we also have roses and they just grow so beautifully
that in fact we put in some more roses yesterday what type roses?
a few different hybrid tea type varieties hybrid teas
we have a few of the real short stem they're kind of like the bush roses
but I don't know I think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a really old bush
but I'm amazed because the sun is so intense and the roses just seem to survive just fine there
that's what we're searching we've got all the different lake editions around the house and we're kind of experimenting right now
we've got the direct sun in front and the backyard has two great big spruce and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall so the backyard is just complete dark all day long
and we're struggling to find something for those areas have you done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not?
they're in pretty good condition
we've been pretty lucky on that just if you want a lot of light for underneath that may be all right because we have some old fruit trees
we have a plum that's just about ready to go
so we may just be getting rid of that but our peaches they seem to be doing just fine but they really need pruning
it just seems that even pruning once a year is really not enough but the way they behave
that's true that's true I don't know but what kind of grass are you growing?
it's bermuda bermuda
I've been trying a mixture of the bermuda and the rye
but I may be working a fescue in because of the type of weather it seems that bermuda's fine but it looks like it would hold the soil but it really doesn't
a lot of silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well
but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
but once it gets over seventy seventy five degrees it just dries up shrivels up and dies but
it's there's such a difference through the year
my parents in law they're building a house into the side of a hill it's already been built and everything
they've been living there for about three months now but this is out in west texas
but the wind there has been so bad that they've tried to plant grass and they just have some big time problems
that's it so they just watching their lawn just blow away
but it's quite an undertaking they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property on the side of a hill
it's beautiful you can see the house from miles away
but it's a pretty neat little job but they save a lot of energy
but just for them they're going to have to start gardening it's going to be from the ground up the whole way
and they said we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed
it's amazing all they have are mesquite and cottonwoods
and it's all on lake greenbelt that property out there
and I don't know what they have they have all the water they want
actually they can pump water they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore
but that's for an additional they have to pay some kind of fee per year
but right now though I think they're trying to get the trees planted and everything
but I just think of all of the money that they're going to have to spend just getting that but the taxes alone there lake greenbelt and some places they really nail them for tax
and you're talking just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes it's ridiculous
that really is it would it seem like it be just the opposite when you get it's because even though it's far out there it's just that lake greenbelt they try to do it just from selling the water
but the water usage they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it people still use it enough in towns like clarendon and other areas where they irrigate
they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming but the irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years
that's true that but I don't know I just came back from there and just the air is so dry I don't see how anything can survive out there for long periods of time
should say my father in law says the mesquite trees they're pretty smart they're smart they're about the smartest tree around they don't even start growing until may or april after it's been raining for a few months that's true that's true they say the roots have developed so that's all they work on just a leafy they don't do anything
that's something I've been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year
and we're trying to decide what to put on one side of the house and things like that but there's so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks then it's just a bush there from then on it's kind of disappointing I don't know my wife and I on the south side of our house we planted some gardenias
and they did real fine during the summertime it's just but during the fall when the rain let off just a little bit it just dried up
so I guess these plants they don't it's like they remain for n I s t the national institute of standards and technology
so it's right up your alley then I suppose so let me push the button
I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system but I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon
I don't think it's going to happen either but I wish it were because I got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering I'm at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric stuff you're now in what? acoustics acoustics
so everything's metric and then you go to read some order book or something and it's all confusing so I don't understand as much so I think we should get one adopted permanently I guess that is the policy but it's been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens I suppose some things happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening having a new generation come up that's more used to it
a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to they have to for international trade
but I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be because of computers coming into everything
I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal I think people need to understand more what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something just get used to using all the terms because someone says a kilogram no one knows what that is everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind
I don't see that it can change it very quickly we're not the kind of society that something can be posed upon by government will
no one seems to be adopting it metric system no one wants it at all seems like the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems money dollar coins anything like that
and it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in using the old system
it's pretty tough when you get everything confused though I think two systems is worse than one though because we do a lot of problems and things and they're half english and half metric and you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems just get one I prefer metric but even if it's english they should just have one I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day
I think so your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination there are things you could do we have signs up on the n I s t campus here speed limit twenty five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour
but that hasn't been adopted very widely
they have some of those in ohio there's this one sign's kind of funny it says metric signs next hundred miles
and no one will go a step further to remove the english signs
that would force everybody to use it or to quit selling tape measures in inches or you have highway signs saying speed limit eighty five whatever would be the appropriate number
I guess a hundred is sixty two hundred car is going sixty two it would be more like ninety I guess car is going fifty five you suddenly have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now
you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety where you are do the schools emphasize the metric system?
in the engineering they all do pretty much I meant down in the elementary schools
in the elementary schools I don't know I wouldn't think so I remember a ways back we did conversions I think
but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system I think my children learned the metric system but it doesn't get emphasized over the other
they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and that's about it
like I told you before and you're talking about credit cards
we put ours up I had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up I wish I had
you should try it I it was done for me after a while I had a business going and this was back in the eighties I don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that but I had a coin shop and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling
so I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally
you lost your business?
what a nightmare it was I ended up going into it was one of those things it'll get better next week things will pick up and so there I was in old bankruptcy court
you weren't charging gold and silver were you? you can't do that can you?
you can? I was buying from other dealers and they take payment any way they can get it
that's a nightmare course on merchandise that I was buying on cards I was getting the money back because I was selling it I wasn't buying just to hold onto it but it was things like rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up
I remember before I got married when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications
of course you fill them all out because you're honored
and I had stuff for sanger harris and it got up to couple of hundred dollars and I thought that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month I wasn't thinking a thing about it that's the way they suck you in
I was just stupid and every time they had a sale there I was
because get such good bargains
and I don't know just today in the mail I got my guaranteed acceptance by american express
we've been getting those
I went back to school and got my master's and they started sending those things to me again as soon as you're a graduate student they get your name
they did and course I guess I've been purged from their records I used to have an american express back when I had my business I got one
and they goofed up bad on my very first bill because I was using the american express strictly for the travel expenses
and the bill would come in and I'd pay it and the very first bill I paid it and then I got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay so I said it just crossed in the mail so I didn't do anything about it two weeks later I get another letter even nastier and said we're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay and I looked at that and I said uh huh so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so I made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks
turned out they weren't cheeky they were I tell you they don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year
so what is it now? it's up to fifty five on the gold card it's eighty five for the optima or
what do you mean fifty five? you mean fifty five dollars? for the green card
but then what's the interest? that's the card
and interest is like eighteen or something it's of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any but on the optima card it's let's see right now it's running at about it's not too bad it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go
credit cards they're dangerous
my parents don't hardly use them mine don't either mine don't either they my mom has a mastercard and a visa card and that's it
I've got all my gas cards because I don't want to carry money around
I'll do that I do use gas cards
impact is kind of bad too though
especially if you forget to record those little suckers
plastic is just too easy that's the whole problem with it
and you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase
of course you got to charge it and keep your cash naturally that's I got into all kinds of trouble doing that
what are you saying? my husband says I might buy it but I don't really usually consider that an option
having been out of the credit game for some years now I've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it
maybe that's how we got in trouble and
but it's hard isn't it? it is but I'm kind of grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint
it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic I just went out and got a new v c r yesterday with cash with cash? and it's
do you work with t I? I wish I did
you could have got a discount couldn't you? I could use a discount I have to wait for things to go on sale
but there's always a sale especially on electronic goods especially now
what is that thing I saw circuit world or something circuit city
circuit city have you been in there? their prices aren't that terrific they used to be but they've got to pay for all that national advertising now it's national?
I think I've seen two around dallas they're all over the country now
what else they used to be good I remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains I don't know if you have a place there called or you probably have something similar we call it service merchandise
in garland you got service merchandise
it used to be service merchandise was the place to go and circuit city came along and that was the place to go to get your t v s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now so
so much for circuit city
what else can we talk about? who do you work for? I don't I'm a graduate student I'm a professional student sounds wonderful it is we were talking about that just today it's great we could be just lifelong students it is great I love it where are you going to school? n c state
what's that? north carolina state
so you're on spring break? not yet ours doesn't start until next week so where are you? where am I?
what do you mean where? in raleigh
little the burgeoning metropolis of raleigh what a dead place
is it? I've got a nice little business at home and I sit around and tinker with that most of the time
so what are you getting your degree in? human factors and what do you do with it? not a thing
what is it? it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them
it's sociology it's more psychology and engineering my master's is in industrial engineering
so you're working on your doctorate?
p h d in human factors
that will sound wonderful won't it?
get you a little plaque I b m a lot of people use human factors folks but I b m is what I'm looking at right now
aren't they laying off several thousand people? they might be but not at the human factors level they're
I heard it on the news today I could swear it was I b m as a matter of fact the I b m in carey which is a little suburb of raleigh just hired one more human factors person
doggone it if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me I'm going into the dissertation this summer how much longer do you have?
and get that done this summer? I'm going to start this summer I probably won't finish it until the end of the year
but I'm trying to get a intern position with I b m right now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in because you it's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field
why? there has been so much work done already? that's that and it's limited application in some respects in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people most
I guess I don't really have a problem with capital punishment I'm not really sure what the exact specifications are for texas I know that they have capital punishment for certain crimes and that's probably the way I feel about it is it kind of depends on the crime that's committed my belief all my life has been that if you take someone else's life then you automatically are giving up yours in place of it but I don't seems to be a lot of controversy about that
I tend to agree with you probably pretty similar views on it but that's one of the things I don't understand is so much of the controversy because I do also myself believe in capital punishment it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the state when they so callously and usually without even thinking or without any concern end somebody else's life and in a lot of cases several people's lives that's true I guess there's probably two or three different types of views as far as the controversy goes I can see where if a life was taken by accident or not premeditated or primarily by accident there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for but I lean towards if it's premeditated or if it's kind of a tendency that people may get into then I guess I don't really have a problem with it
that's kind of the way I feel if you've got a guy who's been to trial and has been in and out of jail basically a three time loser for the twelfth time and he goes out and kills somebody he's not going to be reformed he's not going to get any better it's just not going to get any better and the only thing a lot of people have the opinion that don't have capital punishment but give them life in jail and I could go along with that if I could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten or twelve years
I think that's what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in mesquite who was out in six months
it's just our criminal system is just so overloaded but the problem is not so much with the prison system because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws and the prison system are just they're trying to cope with them but the thing about capital punishment I a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent to future crime and the way it is now it's not
because you if the state of texas for example may execute somebody twice a year that's no kind of deterrent because we've got literally hundreds of people on death row and many of them who have been there literally for ten or fifteen years on death row
and that's certainly no kind of deterrent and I would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it's not a deterrent because it's not it's not you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after committing a crime are really pretty slim right now and you can probably spend a lot of time or maybe eventually just waiting it out
and that's where a lot of aggravation comes is these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process
they may spend years and the last I heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year to keep these guys waiting
it's amazing there's a girl I work with our secretary as a matter of fact her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in sherman and the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death he's been on death row for eight years
and this was her father that got killed just cold blooded murder him and three other people but still for some reason this guy's sentence has not been carried out he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people and the state still can't bring itself to execute this guy to carry it out it sort of takes the justice out of the justice system
it does it really does she and they have to go back occasionally she has to write letters to the parole board and lawyers and just ever so often she mentions she's got to do something else write another letter or do something it's just it should be over and done with
she should be getting on with her life getting that part behind her but yet it's kind of tied to her the way it is now it is and she winds up being a victim day after day after day
a victim not only indirectly of the crime but also indirectly by that indirect involvement
it's ridiculous she's an emotional victim
it's terrible and and like you say the cops that are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window that
I couldn't be a cop for that very reason because they do the criminal gets right back out and the cop's just got to go back and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are done by repeat offenders they are
it's that's about five minutes so unless you've got something else
it's a pleasure talking with you
ron we'll see you later
I wondered if I was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type
have you been talking to males? this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female I was afraid we might get into an argument
I guess there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for the roles of women
and I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities
they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or all sorts of other things
it seems too me though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner than before I think so
I think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days
sometimes I think I am going crazy trying to do it but
do you work outside the home?
do you have children? they are getting older now
so they are not quite as much of a responsibility but they are still there
they still take time and I still provide most of the things that go on around the house
so and for a while I was going to school too and it was tough
I think that while it's a good change for women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel their expertise may be
I think sometimes other things suffer and I think it's hard to find a balance there but in some ways I think we are expected to do it all you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things and that's where the problem is really
I have little children four and one and I decided that it was very important to me to stay home
and when I happen to be I'm very active with other people with children my age and most of us do tend to stay home but when I run into people that just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time there's almost a friction between us
not people that are necessarily good friends even though that has happened too
it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence you know if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself
and if you don't then sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time at home
it's a tough one I've done some of both
when my kids were real little I was at home for a couple of different periods of time
I think the longest was less than a year but still at least I was able to spend those first months with them
but I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things
the money was the issue
but even now I would like to not have to work in some ways
it's kind of pull and tug
on the other hand I can't imagine just being at home although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue
still there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having a job and all that goes with that
that's definitely true in fact I work out of my home I'm an accountant
and I do taxes and bookkeeping and I it was it's a way for me to stay home
and I still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night
but it's worked out for my family to have my cake and eat it too kind of thing
that's a good deal where do you think this is going in the future do you think things are going to change or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this?
I hope that they will change but I'm I just I know it's going to be a slow change I feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner I'm just thinking of my circle of people that I know I know quite a few people who have decided to not have both of the parents work
and yet I I hope to see employer based helping out child care centers at the place of employment and things like that that will help out what do you think do you think we are setting a trend? I don't
I see some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children
and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the family things work
but I don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers it's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are I don't know if they want to completely give that up
it's a very personal thing but it would be nice if there could be an in between a middle ground somewhere
I think it's hard though when you talk about families and raising children because I think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground I think they need security and yet they I don't know I speaking from my children they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that
they want to know things are going to be a certain way I think they like a routine of sorts
we will see I'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society I like the fact that gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be
the numbers are still very skewed to say the least I enjoyed talking to you you too ellen
the question was what kind of books do you read for entertainment I guess
I just read for escape
it's with two little kids I can understand that
that's simple I read to escape and I don't read any parents magazines either so what kind of
I just finished one last night a great book it's very a typical for my reading though but a great book one called the things they carried by tim o'brien
and it's I don't know if I would call it a collection of vietnam war stories or if I'd call it a collection of vietnam love stories
strange book beautifully written
just beautifully written by somebody who was there or
a guy who was there as a foot soldier
so he considered himself to be a true vietnam soldier any of the guys that were ground I can imagine
what's the latest one you've read? I tell you what I'm kind of a history nut I'm trying to think back now I read an awful lot of periodicals and almost what you call reference books
and I'm embarrassed to say the last honest to gosh cover to cover book that I read I tried to read one of the michener lone star or the texas history book
I have never been able to make it through any of michener's work I've had similar problems it does tend to
are you a civil war buff at all? as a matter of fact
because I finished one I think this is two years ago and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy women's novels set in the civil war john jakes with
and the novel didn't do that much for me but the period of time was fascinating
so I then read was it battle cry of freedom
or I think it was battle cry of freedom battle cry of freedom
it's kind of like a historical compendium of the civil war
and it's not a story of the civil war it's a story of all the politics and lobbying and just basically state by state events that lead to the events that brought about the civil war
and it's fascinating because I had always been raised on this emancipation proclamation with the civil war there was a lot more to it than that weren't there?
there was a lot more to it than that as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought it was a political move
it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because if you read it it only emancipated those who were in areas in rebellion against the united states all the other areas which at that time would have included west virginia and kentucky a few states that were not part of the south but still had slaves
they didn't emancipate them
you know what else really surprised me I'm married to a native texan and I'm not
I've got the same problem
I'm glad you put it that way
and I have two native texan children too
my husband is always talked about texas being a rebel state
and all this civil war pride I kept waiting for where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the civil war isn't much there was there?
they might as well have not even been there
they weren't a state and the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to who's going to be going there and I keep telling my husband that and he keeps saying I thought okay they supplied some they were some groups of it the vicksburg if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg the battleground at vicksburg there's an area there where there was some texas groups and they had an interesting time there
I'll bet they did and down there at sabine pass I can't think of the guy's name but just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole union navy for a while from coming up the sabine river which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story
you know why they actually held them off? none of the yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar that could be it
you didn't hear me say that outside of and then the last civil war battle was fought at val verde over there on the texas border you had a lot of groups heading for mexico and they were cut off at the pass more or less at eagle pass and they didn't get across the river there so they're the last and that was actually after the war was over but it was the last organized battle between the two units was in texas so
texas participation in the civil war was minor at it's been
don't tell that to a native texan though
they fought and won the whole thing my wife's from galveston so
I'm from new mexico so I was
that's a beautiful state that's a beautiful state I was raised in the midwest which we didn't even know where the mason dixon line was
and besides if corn didn't grow there it didn't matter it sounds like iowa or something iowa and nebraska
and then I had probably lived the last eleven years in massachusetts so what does that make me an honorary yankee
or god knows what on
my sister's living in illinois right now so
then she's going to come out well rounded
but outside of those kind of things the other thing that I've really gotten into reading is science fiction
I've always kind of enjoyed it I used to read a lot more than I do now
I've gone to the point where my husband travels I get out two or three books
and I'm trying to think of isaac asimov robot series
I think I've read all four of them and I understand that there's a fifth
in the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot I just turned around and looked at my bookcase up here and I see armageddon up there and the shadow of blooming grove and two thousand and ten and grant takes command and the war in the year space that was the one I was trying to wade through was space james michener didn't get very far on that
I think I read hawaii when I was about ten years old so
which is about the developmental level that you need to be at to read those things and even then I was so disgusted with it I tried to read whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller
and I got about a hundred pages through it and realized I had a thousand more I thought I can't do this it really the books are kind of imposing to say the least
let's see here's one called ghost towns and mining camps of new mexico not too many people have read that one I don't think
and there's the history of yoakum county texas there I've got
is that a big thick book? and I've got a history of kingsley iowa
what the hell for? why kingsley iowa? because that's where my folks all came from
and they had a centennial here awhile back I read the grant takes command that was pretty good
that was part of that trilogy that bruce canton did that's one
I don't know I had never really been into science fiction that much until somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago
I don't know if I'd call it science fiction or fantasy sometimes it's awful hard some of those get very philosophical they can be in any setting they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting the
I loved that novel and then somebody said this would have been even long ago because I was in boston and it was raining all night and I had a hole in my roof and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse and I was reading dune which seeming rather ironic
and I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out ten gallon buckets of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits you're reading dune
and I think that's probably my favorite of any piece of science fiction that I've ever read that was a movie too wasn't it? and the movie was awful was it?
it was just terrible I didn't see it but
it was beyond patrick stewart was in that I guess the guy that's on the new star trek series was in that thing
I don't know I just remember sting was in it
and if you were trying to follow any type of plot it even having read the book watching that movie I couldn't figure out what they were talking about at all couldn't
I was real disappointed in that I'll tell you another good book do you like scary things? some history books are pretty scary have you but
that's true have you read the silence of the lambs? somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen
they didn't sleep all night
I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book
the book is chilling I have
just chilling I don't have the foggiest notion what it's about so
then I won't tell you but
it's just that if you ever really want to just be scared out of your wits that's the one
that's the one even better than jaws and some of that?
because the character that is so horrible is another human being and you're just drawn into his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him
a freddy kruger type?
this guy's smart and he's suave and he's all the characteristics the worst kind
all the characteristics it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution
and I can very clearly remember ten years ago I was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful and we did end up with I b m p c s which I now would not have chosen
but that was before the macintosh
and twenty years ago I was in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
I know it so I would say that's one of the largest changes at least in my life
I've seen that just in the last even five years how much they've increased in use or probably eight years when I was a freshman in college my degree was in computer technology originally
and it seemed like it would they were just getting out with the disks and all that doing away with the programming cards
and thirty years ago I had a college job working as a programmer and we had to write code in binary and have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which I don't think exists anymore I know
you never see one of those punch cards anymore
I think t v has a lot to do with the changes too don't you? in people's attitudes very possibly I'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before certainly in the last thirty I would say there have been significant changes even the change from black and white to color television
thirty years ago I guess there were color t v s but I sure didn't have access to one
but twenty years ago practically everybody had a color t v and now I think they're almost as many there are more t v s than households so it's close to one t v per person they say
and now everybody has v c r s and two or three v c r s and that kind of thing
certainly ten years ago v c r s were just coming on the market so that's made a significant difference in the way I watch television for instance because now I almost never watch a t v program when it's on
I know I tape it and then watch it when it's convenient and that way I don't have to worry about being interrupted I can just put it on pause
and you can flip through the commercials so you don't have to watch the commercials
that's always convenient you can watch a program in forty five minutes instead of an hour you skip the commercials
what was our question about decline in wasn't the decline so much I think they just said the social changes in the united states
how was life different ten twenty or thirty years ago so
I can't really remember back that far but ten years ago in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with little a m radios
and now people have jam box with c d players in them and hand held t v s and car phones that's certainly a difference
that's another one car phones is a good point and cellular phones of all types and beepers ten years ago I was working in a job at a medical center
and I had to carry a beeper around and they were kind of bulky and all they did was just make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call
these days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils and they fit in your shirt pocket and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a phone number to respond to and
those are cool those are pretty neat and they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off in a theatre or something
and you can still get your messages
but let's see social changes
where do you think it's going to go in twenty years? I haven't the slightest idea I was just thinking though about a huge social change in the last ten years is aids
it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago I know that because I was writing a paper about it
I was writing a journal article and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything and there was a suspicion that it was a virus
but nobody had identified it and they were really just going on epidemiological guesswork because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like hepatitis
and then from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by blood and semen and then I
I'm curious what was your graduate study in? I was in english as a matter of fact and medieval studies
but I went to work as an editor and writer so ten years ago I was working in the medical center publishing a journal and writing about medical topics
and let's see twenty years ago I guess we were just beginning to get into what they were calling the sex revolution after the pill
and freed people up from worries about illegitimate pregnancy and I guess in the seventies is the time when that was supposed to have exploded thirty years ago there was no pill
you think that's caused a lot of pressure on younger kids today to make choices that they probably shouldn't have to make?
I do I really do I have four kids in college right now children and stepchildren
and I know that the expectation for them was to have sex and much earlier than the expectation when I was in college
in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping with their boyfriends
but they certainly didn't expect everybody to and it was really only acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in the relatively near future
and I certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays
it's kind of scary when I think of what will happen in twenty years when I have kids and they're grown and just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more so and I guess the answer is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years seems like it can't get much worse
I certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what my kids were likely to be like course one of them was just a brand new baby twenty years ago so I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him
and some of the other ones weren't born
sounds like america's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and worldwide communication and electronic mail
I just got on that about a year ago and that's made a difference in the way I do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things even when they're on another continent
it's pretty wild even that reminds me federal express was around ten years ago but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency
and nowadays people use fed ex all the time
sure do people do seem to travel more it's much more common for people even teenagers to be going to europe and south america and asia
I was almost thirty before I got off this continent
and both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
I know that's what my family was talking when I picked up and moved to texas from indiana and they were thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that
and especially come home every couple months and
where have you all been on vacation recently? recently my most recent trip was last year and that was detroit detroit?
is that a nice vacation spot? it wasn't really it was to see an old relative
and it was just to have some fellowship with her
so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot? the only thing that I visited that is quite a tourist spot is cancun mexico
that would be nice and that was real nice
did you scuba dive there? we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there
that would be nice and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine
that would be enjoyable that's a nice break
I haven't been on vacation in a while either usually when we go we go to colorado to estes park area which is up kind of near denver and stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the texas heat that kind of thing
that's always refreshing to get away from
so it's a lot of fun I worked up there last summer so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long that's nice
worked at a camp there and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains so that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity and that's canoeing
and they've been to the guadalupe river and they also have been to colorado and they've really enjoyed it
that's nice we canoed up in arkansas at the buffalo river it's a whole new
and that's the best place that I've ever canoed
it's really really pretty I was a little kid then and we to have we stayed at some park and they had a little mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about mountain things I think he wasn't a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river
and we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and that's a good family place to go that's neat
and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening but it wasn't too easy either
it was you learn a lot of skills too and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills
that's true and I think it really penetrates in your memory what to do because you really have a great interest in it because it's something you weren't forced to do
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
and you're more receptive
that's good we let's see the only other place I've ever vacationed we'd go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that
and then I went to england a few years ago that's exciting
I was a student there and spent a semester studying abroad in london
and that was a great time because that's such a neat place and there's not a language barrier so you don't there's a little bit because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents but it was really fun I really enjoyed that I'm probably going back there to work for a year
I had a friend that visited england probably two years now but that's her next goal is go back to england because she really has a great desire to do that because the love that she has for it now after visiting it
it's really nice I would spend all my time in london or most of my time
and it was really different being in a big city because I don't get much into really urban areas a lot
and it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which I thought I would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone
you could just kind of walk around and observe do your own thing
I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people and I had a great time doing that it was really interesting that's wonderful there's a lot out there to see I know I'll say
I keep wanting to get up to I haven't been anywhere else outside the united states I haven't been to mexico or canada or I lived across the street almost from canada
so that's a nice place canada is very nice
that would be nice I had a friend from there
then I'd love to go somewhere in asia but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that
somebody that knows their way around
so that's why england was nice even we traveled in europe for about a week and that was even nice because there wasn't the we went to germany and switzerland and you've been quite a few places there
we have we whirlwinded through europe once you think about it
it was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop a city a day and you slept on the train at night that's great
but there wasn't a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in germany knew english and everyone in switzerland knew english that's great
so we were kind of pitiful we found one restaurant we were in and got seated and then no one knew english in there and we finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things but it was what did you wind up with?
I had fondue that was easy to say
tried to get fondue and white wine and that was
we were able to have that pretty effortlessly there were some people at the next table who spoke english so we elicited their aid for a while they kind of guided you
and they were very helpful
so it was a pleasant time
I'd love to go back there there's just not time there's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the means to pursue our dreams
that's I guess that's what retirement is all about
that and sleeping late I keep hoping for
it was nice talking with you I understand that
it was nice talking with you too craig and have a good afternoon you do the same thank you
what do you think about the peace corps or public service commitment?
that's the first I've ever heard of it I haven't heard anything too much about it I think it was thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from some sort of public service like the conservation corps back in the thirties or various other things of that sort
and it seems to me that it's not a totally bad idea but I don't quite see how they'd make it work
how would they decide who goes into building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia?
I the my first impression was it would be very good I think it would be good for people to serve but I don't know if it should be an option it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids and I think there are some available now where they are able to work but making it a mandatory thing kind of the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary
and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
and some people would get military service and some people would get civilian service like working in hospitals
this I assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the army
they were allowed to do hospital service or things like that and if they or farm work in world war one I remember reading about
and I suppose that there is justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
but I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable
it seems like you'd have a lot more conscientious objectors if they had that choice it's a possibility
I'd much rather work in a hospital than to go war and I'm sure most young men and women would and so I think that in the cases like that they had to be pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war
it was something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
that makes sense and then you run into the bureaucracy in running it how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something for their room and board
and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend even if it's like the peace corps where they don't get most of it until they come home you have to pay them something
plus the training involved
that would be expensive in most cases
because I had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps back in the mid sixties
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand I'm not sure what the permanent value of it was I don't know what we got for all the money
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh and to algeria and to southeast asia and lots of out of the way places
but I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
I know in I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan
and I was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me it taught me not to be so self centered and to think of others
but I don't know if I was doing it in different situation not a really religious background if I would get a lot out of it I think I did because it emphasized that sort of thing a lot of self evaluation and it was definitely voluntary too they were not drafting you and sending you against your will
and I'm sure that would make a big difference too you've got what about a voluntary program? do you think that would be a good idea?
like I say I know that there are some type of programs that they have available for teenagers to go and do work in the national parks and work in neighborhoods to clean up and that sort of thing but I don't know what organization it's under I don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private charity that's put it together I don't either
but I know that that helps a lot with training and a lot of out here in california there's a program like that for juvenile delinquents the ones that are not dangerous
and they don't have to be locked up go to these camps and they do forestry work
they maintain trails and they put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
and that I know is run by the state but there may be other things I'm not so sure what kind of training that is for the future for those kids
how much benefit it'll do them in the long run? it's probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble
but whether it's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject
especially if you take a child that's from the inner city and then put them in a middle of a park if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less be able to take care of them that's true good point
so that may not benefit them in the long run
but I'm sorry I'm going to have to go but my other line is blinking
thank you but it was good to talk to you you too
I guess my task I usually ride my bike I have a stationary bike and a regular bike and when I can I like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer the stationary bike is so boring
boring but I have head phones plus I have it in the living room so I either watch t v or we have a fish tank
so I watch the fish whatever I can do to keep myself occupied I like to have the t v on because that usually keeps me more occupied it kind of takes the time away and I don't realize that's really the only time I ever watch t v is when I'm on the bike and then usually after I'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down I usually take a walk and that just kind of gets me to where I'm not quite as tired I guess but it's definitely a task you think so? I can't say that I really enjoy it I wish that I did enjoy it more but I do it because I have to not because I want to
I bought a stationary bike but I find that if I sit on that seat too long it hurts
and I haven't figured how to get that soft and I tried even tying a pillow to it but two years ago I joined the cosmopolitan lady here in plano and I love it I just love it so is it just women that go there?
it's totally women I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a health club because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise so I have tried to just do stuff at home and I just feel conscious about it I'm not big or anything but I still don't like other people watching me
I like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess feel that if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low
and my bathing suit's just one piece so there's no big deal all the way around but I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it
and it's a total free relaxation because you can do what you want you're a female and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing that's what
and they've got such fantastic equipment in there that's great how and I love the water aerobics I love the water aerobics do they have a pool or what is
they've got a nice one
they have two types of water aerobics they call it aqua exercise is what they call it I've heard that that's really good for you to do
it pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself
so it is double strenuous but you're not being double strenuous on your own body because you're pushing it yourself so you're doing it yourself so you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you?
when you're in the water?
the only thing that I ever felt was every time I stop and start going again because I end up getting two jobs once in a while I end up having to quit for a while but I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because I really jump a lot
that's funny I never would have thought of that
a lot of people wear those little terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom especially around the pool so they just wear them right into the pool are they water shoes? is that
they're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber soles so that
no big deal one way or the other that's really funny
but I never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway so no big deal that's
but it's fun so how often do find yourself going? if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go?
I try to make it at least three times a week that's really
for a while I was doing it every day just going five days a week
I wish that I could make myself exercise every day but I do force myself to do it at least three times a week which I don't feel like is enough but it's at least something it I have to force myself to do it like I said because to me I really don't enjoy it but I know that I have to do it it's not a question of whether I want to but
when I was working up at the summit here in plano I'd leave there
and I'd be at the swimming pool actually about four thirty because they start at five to six that's
so I was there by four thirty every night and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet
because no matter what I did or how I did it I invariably got myself wet
but the water only comes up basically anywhere from your waist to your chest I'd say
so it's your choice where you want to go but I enjoyed it higher did you ever I'm sorry
that's okay did you ever go to texins at all when you were working for t I? did you ever try that? I have a bad back
so I'm very limited what I do
it's like I can walk but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me
especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard it will bother me then that would it will bother me I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it?
what pushed me that way though basically was the fact that when I went in there is wasn't for the water aerobics I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles
and she said go for the swimming pool she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor she says in fact you get more
I said because I'm not a swimmer
I like water I'm not scared of it but I couldn't I guess I could swim across the pool but I'm no swimmer per se
but I found that this worked really well and I came out of there and I saw my stomach going down well
I dropped almost twenty pounds just by watching what I ate and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good what if you're already on one? I mean
what? a diet? when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs would they?
they have nothing to do with that
when this one down here opened up I joined as a v I p and the v I p gives you a computerized diet and they go over all your health and all your history and they show you everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards so it became part of the package so I went through it it worked out well but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program is that what you're saying?
you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too I see
I just went and took the because they were offering it as an opening benefit so it's less than what you pay now for going in there after all this time
so it's like when I got laid off I went back in there and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it
so I get all the same treatment again so it's kind of nice that's
like I said I like it I like the heat I like the I jump out of the swimming pool and I go into the hot tub
and I love it that would be really nice
because I have never let me reword that I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore but that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did
that's I knew I was pushing too far but usually when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming or when I come out I'm totally relaxed when I go home it's no big deal so you really do enjoy your exercise then since your
it's fun it's fun I've gotten on the bike and they've got the stepping bike where you step
and I've enjoyed that watching how well I can walk up and down stairs that's I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike
but most of the others to me are very dull but I got talked into the bike instead and I don't know I really wanted a stepper I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too but I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them which one do you feel is better since you use them both?
I get bored very easily the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit like you said you can sit and do it and watch the t v and not even really be conscious of what you are doing
with the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down
so you have a little you can program the one at cosmopolitan lady so to what your gear is
I it would depend upon which one you want I think now that I've had the bicycle I would go to the stepper but if I were you I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while because you can buy a month's membership and see what you feel is best for you
because it all depends for everyone their own what they want to do because I jump on the bike here at home mine has the handle bars go up and down
so I can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said and it has no effect on me so it's boring
what do you think is the worst culprit for air pollution? I think it's probably a combination of things factories that burn coal as an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides
those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain and I think that's probably hurting us a little bit it's hurting germany for example too and some other parts of europe where they have high industry so we're not the lone ranger here
I it's hard to put the finger on what's worse the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion with your hydrocarbons causing the damage in which hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot
I notice on one of these home shopping networks they were selling these halogen fire extinguishers
and the halogen is an ozone depleter and it got hydrocarbons in there it's a very clean fire extinguisher but it's really bad on the environment I guess I missed that one
automobiles of course are contributing too and you know how we are with our love affair with the auto
kind of hard to do anything about that I guess
I know in the twin cities area I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right but they had a new policy where in order to get your car license renewed you had to meet the pollution standards
and we have that here too but it's part of the inspection sticker they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out and so that's the way they're dealing with it here
I guess that was just mainly in the cities there and as far as where I live I don't have to do that but I have an old car which I doubt would pass the inspection a seventy six
and there's no way I would put in a lot of money to repair it to meet standards it'd probably be difficult anyway
so although I do what I can to cut down pollution but I was just reading an article in mother earth news magazine
and they've got a new a lot of places are burning wood
a lot of people are burning wood those of us who have I've got a place in the country
and they've had catalytic converters on those on I think they're required in california and oregon and washington but they've had up those for quite a while and somebody's come up with a new one that sort of it's a catalytic converter it's a plate that fits into the smoke pipe
and apparently it sort of feeds itself the more smoke is produced after you get to like five hundred degrees the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is and it sounds real neat I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet but that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on older stoves that don't have any kind of e p a requirements on them
that might help a little bit especially in some places we're really lucky here we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out
sometimes we get a kind of a especially in autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well
probably blowing up there to you guys
around here we get it depends either in the winter time it blows it your way and in the summer time we probably get yours it comes back
I really think we're doing some important things education raising consciousness awareness I know school kids I work for the school district here and this is one of the big things with kids kids are writing letters to the newspapers telling adults to clean up their act
and it's I hope we're not too late with it we're having all kinds of recycling
it that's a big thing too I know it has nothing to do with air pollution but I kind of look at the way people treat our
you heard the question what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs?
I'll tell you I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than I do now
I do the easy stuff now I change oil and then what some people would consider a little more difficult I'll change spark plugs and I'll change points and do air filters that kind of stuff
but I can't do as much as I used to I used to do a whole lot more but not any more they're just too weird to work on now is that the reason you're not doing it or are you so busy you don't have time to do it? that's part of it
part of it is like you said I don't have time being a female and being alone I don't do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even
but have you had any major repairs recently?
on this car I've got now but I had a van before and it was only two years old and it had transmission go out on it
but fortunately that was covered under the warranty you should feel very fortunate I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty six automobile
and I'll declare that's an expensive maybe I should have just traded the car in
sometimes it makes you wonder it just I have a very comfortable car and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car
so I have a new transmission
and I'm sure that any of them would have charged me almost the same amount but it hurts real bad
did you take it to a dealership? I took it to an independent out in garland
I see I had these people were recommended by a neighbor
and that's the only thing I am not a native of dallas
I see so that means I have to depend on trustworthy friends
and that's it's fixed it's running and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it
it's going to run for a while yet I know it it certainly is frightening what work are you in? I work for t I
I work in the networking area
do you work for t I?
I have just retired from the southwest medical center
where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car but they're all too busy so
I have to do it the other way and that's find someone and pay them to do it
so I certainly hope you have a nice new year
I'm planning on it it can't be any worse than last year that's for sure it could be but I don't much think so
that's true that's true we're starting out a new one so let's make it a good one
I'm going to try and plan on it
I enjoyed the conversation thank you thank you
we have a sheltie collie a miniature sheltie
do you? it's about six months old and we're we live in an apartment so we don't have a yard so it has to stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it how old is it? it's about six months
you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership I think
but they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs but I guess every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because this one it
I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the training bit
I've had dogs through the years right now I've got two and three cats and my son and daughter in law have kind of a sheltie mix and we watched it this summer for two to three months and it wasn't trained quite fully either
but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog how do you what's the best method?
I don't know I'm old fashioned and when I got my dogs when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside they say that's not the way to do it now you're just supposed to stand outside with them until they
just put them outside unless you catch them in the act we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult
and you don't want to spank it or scare it or anything like that so
you don't want to do that but we try to take it it gets frustrating when you take it outside and then it runs right inside
does it just want to sniff around? and it does it?
does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside? a lot of times and it won't it's little job outside and it comes inside
have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside? we've tried that and there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go
and he chews on plants and all that but that's natural for a little puppy? that's nothing
it'll catch on pretty soon I'll bet you I have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old golden retriever and she's gone the other way because she's so old she doesn't have much control
so we're battling with that problem that's sad
and she still feels good she can't hear worth a darn or see very well but she's got a great appetite and she knows we're there by smell how old is it?
she'll be sixteen in may that's sad and
but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years of course not so we're putting up with all her accidents I couldn't
and the two nights ago she had diarrhea and so that was a bad one but I think we're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend that is really sad what's the deal we're trying to take it on walks now
and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash
and so this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to tug on it to walk it it just goes like a mad dog it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and it's not even close to even being trained on a leash does it
maybe you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes we've heard some bad things about some of those they sometimes misuse their license or whatever they treat them bad
we went to the junior college richland
and we took my daughter was living at home then and she took the norwegian elk hound over there
and it's a pretty good class and they did pretty good except this dog is she's just pretty she's not smart
so she didn't learn a lot but I think it calmed her down a little bit and she's used to being around other dogs now how long did it take?
I think it was a six week program every what?
I think it was one night a week for six weeks
and it was a group class outside it was fairly reasonable too sheltie collies are timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and
they're usually a high strung dog aren't they?
and if they're not accustomed to something they're really scared our friend has a is it mike?
do you repair your own car?
I try to whenever I can I've always been a product of a handyman father I tell you what count your blessings because it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves
there's although I'll tell you over the years the cars get more complicated that's why I don't do as much as I'd like
because they've gotten complicated haven't they?
one of my first cars was a fifty six buick which after awhile I could take it apart in my sleep if I needed to is that right?
it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and now since then the closer a car is to a fifty six buick the more I know about it
and then start getting into these nissans and the like and I just can't keep up I agree about all I ever I never was too mechanically inclined but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and
course they don't use points anymore
that's right but they do still use plugs
and now brakes I've always done a lot of changing brakes
and I could always do the alternator and starter
I don't anymore but I have a lot of times
I understand my last car repair actually had to do with brakes and it's one I did not do myself I took the car my I have a seventy nine el dorado took it to be inspected
and the parking brake failed so I got under there and messed with that adjustment to tighten it up
and that didn't do the trick and then I got there and tried to it probably slipped loose didn't it?
actually that wasn't even eventually the problem I did everything that I could think to do
and eventually I brought it up to a place called just brakes
and it turns out that there's a the parking brake in the rear there's disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston deal
and because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up
they ended up having to pound it out and one of them they were able to get running kind of oiling it and playing with it
and the other one it was just frozen solid so I ended up having to buy one and all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done it really wasn't quite as bad as you thought was it?
actually I think it was a lot of money but I don't like I it was a lot of money but
but I it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on so you had to have the help didn't you?
that's right that's right do you still do much work on them then?
I do actually that was just at the beginning of september and whenever I can I do try I actually I'd say this I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore only because disposal is a problem
that is one problem but also these fast oil change places you just can't beat them that's true
for sixteen bucks not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do as good a job as I can do but they'll lube too that's true
that I've quit doing that myself
but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil
that's right but it but I guess that and the main reason that it's quick
we taxes everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure but I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases what do you think?
I think so I think I'm a little out of the ordinary in that I think I'm more worried about the national deficit than a lot of other people are and think that we need to either raise our taxes or cutback on something and I don't know what to cutback on to get that settled at this stage it's hard to tell
and I know I'm real out of it in terms of taxes
so I'm think that we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do for texas and at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them I think so
I know I live in richardson
and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
but now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there look what the schools could cost you
now I when we moved to richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the schools and realizing that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to go for that because we supported the
then again the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country
one of the I don't know which one it is down there down there that are proposing doubling the tuition if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
I think that's right that would provide possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things
the so called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount but eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even
I don't know about that I I quit ten years ago so I couldn't afford to start again I see
that would be true that would be true but I know my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think
but all the various taxing authorities that come through I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for dart which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
and even if it isn't going to provide you with any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your home to a business for instance this is a thing I think it's like back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it if we had been like a chicago or a new york city or philadelphia or someone like that and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and construction costs were cheap you could afford it
but now digging tunnels under central expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive and
and the other thing is that when the public transportation is established that early on then the business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that
whereas in dallas here those patterns were well established before we really tried to do the dart and for instance all the office buildings and stuff that are out here in north dallas as opposed to downtown to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the metroplex to both those centers of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area like new york does
just take in chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere
new york and some people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car
someone made the analogy with texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street most texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
and I'm just as guilty as anyone else
I drive to work every day by myself without even any thought of car pooling
and most people are that way because they're used to not having public transportation
so but here again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt and doing all these studies and the things
we saw about them traveling to san francisco to see whether they wanted or twelve foot wide cars or something
I felt that was a little wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying
a little bit much the that's about all I can say at this time
I think so I think that will probably do it so it's been real nice talking with you good enough
what is your favorite kind of music?
I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be classical music same here
what type of music do you like in the classical area or what era do you like the most? I guess I like a wide range everything from baroque through at least some modern music
and my wife and I these days are especially into opera we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now
do you go to the operas that they sing english or go to the ones that they sing other languages? we generally the places we've gone they sing in the original languages
the dallas opera here normally does I guess
I haven't gotten into that too much because if I don't know the story line and I don't speak the language then I have difficult time comprehending what's going on one thing that's helped us a lot is that you can buy a lot of these operas now on video tape
and so we have quite a collection of those and you watch them at home and they have subtitles so you figure out what's going on after a while and then you can enjoy it in the theater
but the dallas opera now has super titles on all their performances I think
what is that? they give an english translation on a screen up above the stage I didn't know that
that can help people like me in fact they even do that for operas sung in english because it is hard to understand the words sometimes
I can understand that so I'd say vivaldi is probably my favorite composer
I really like vivaldi he's definitely one of the top of that era
I like baroque music
I like full body music with brass and winds woodwinds instruments
course I like also string instruments and I have two string in my house instrument players both my sons play string instruments one plays the cello and the other one plays the viola
so I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year how old are they? one is thirteen and one is eleven so they're doing this in school or what?
you've got half a string quartet there we're on our way
so I try to enjoy all of it since you seem to like italian music have you ever gotten into gabrielli or anybody there in that era the period before vivaldi?
a little bit but a lot of the music I don't know about as far as the titles and I have to listen to it and figure out what I'm listening to
I do belong to a musical heritage society
do you belong to that? I don't but I think I know what it is isn't that a can't you get records through that or something recordings?
you can get recordings they know have them on compact disc or cassettes or l p s
and they do a lot of original recordings themselves I think
but they also go to the different composers or the different what do you call them the guys that orchestrate the conductors
they go to conductors and they actually have them perform the music and they record it so they're actually commissioned performances a lot of them are or they will find out when they're performing
and they will record the music at that time and so it is high quality grade music and of course now they also have a jazz section and they also have a more contemporary and american composer section
I had heard good things about the music heritage society but if I get involved in one of those things I end up spending all my money on music
you can control it I almost bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the columbia record club many years ago
my roommate signed me up he got a bonus record and I got a lot of bills I see so we have to watch that
that's good do you play any instrument yourself?
I play guitar and early years played saxophone
deanna on capital punishment in our state they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman
and I believe also in killing someone in the process of rape
and I don't really remember what else but
what do you think about it I think it's justified very much so
I agree I I think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman
I do too I do too I think they're doing their duty but I think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman that's right I agree
I agree I heard something on the news the other night they were talking about it was in our little lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week there's a little thing at the bottom it's like a call in survey that says do you think so and then you call this number and you press one for yes and two for no
and one of the questions the other day this last paper was do you think that capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers which I thought was a real interesting question I think
did you see sixty minutes tonight by any chance?
I didn't they were showing a segment on a man in philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers he's just a civilian he's a black man
and he just got fed up with it
and he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to keep him quiet
but he's organizing people and they're going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory
I think that's what it's going to take though I think so I think
I really do it's going to take the police I don't think can do it alone that's right I think you're right
it's going to take all of us getting together I'm sorry I'm trying to my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed
it's going to take all of us getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more we won't allow this in our neighborhood that's right that's right and it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there
and then quite often they'll get shot because they're horning in on somebody else's territory
that's right that's right I think they said forty one had been shot out of one church in the last year
the only thing about the death penalty I know that they try to be careful and they try to be sure but these people are on death row for twenty years I know it
if I think being convicted is one thing and that's great if they're sentenced to death to me you could not sentence them to death unless the case was for sure it it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're
by the time it gets there and they've been convicted and then they've been sentenced to death they're sure there's no doubt I then it should happen there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty that's right
so once they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it just
I guess that sounds cold but we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row and not doing anything with them that's right
and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money and that's terrible to look at it that way but it is I know but that's the way it is
if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it we had one in virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago I don't know if there was anything in your paper about it
I didn't notice it and there was a lot of protest even robert redford was protesting this guy's execution
so the governor backed down and I was so mad
his crime was just horrible
and those kind of people you don't reform them I don't think I really you don't
if they're the kind of people that commit these grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again you don't reform those kind of people and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me
and I don't know the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas
if you're insane enough that you can go cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then can you be helped
I have my doubts that's right I do too
I don't know I think there's a point some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it just gets out of hand
and I understand that my husband and I wasn't it lewisburg that had a lot of bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks or was it not
I think it was the south east area from dallas
my daughter lives down in rowlett
and she was telling me about it
I can't remember what the town was some little area
we've had several here lately and it there were several of them in north dallas and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in south dallas and that's maybe what you were talking about men breaking in to houses and or a man taking little girls right straight out of their beds at night and breaking in obviously watching them in the house because they're breaking into the right window the little girl's bedroom and taking them out putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards and that's the last they is that right
that is happened I hadn't heard about that
I think there's been six or seven of them over the last probably eight or nine months they don't kill them? they just
they don't kill them
they've and they're all anywhere from nine to twelve years old is what they've been
and he's taken them and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard that's scary isn't it
can you imagine because it happens in the middle of the night so these parents didn't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in
can you imagine you wouldn't even dare put little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire have you seen those?
I've got one of those in brian's room
I never even thought about that maybe I'll take it out
I hadn't even thought about it that's terrible it is
it's really bad that you have to be we were over at a neighbor's tonight and my little boy is just a little over two and their little boy is five so there's a big difference
and they were playing in the back yard and we were getting ready to leave and I went out in the back yard to get brian and the boys were gone and the back fence was open
and she didn't act like it bothered her at all this happens all the time and we walked through the fence out the alleys come to the back of the house
and I looked down both directions of the alley and I saw neither one of them and she was he does this all the time where are you screaming j d
and my heart was in my throat and he's five? shoo I guess so
and brian was two houses down
and he I don't know I know
parents around here just let their kids run everywhere and I just can't do that there was a little girl picked up in rowlett from her front yard and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard and somebody apparently drove up and took her and they never saw her again
this is too scary that is just too scary
I let brian play here in the back yard and there's two gates that go into the back yard and we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences
and one of the gates has a padlock on it and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things but it's on the inside
it's they'd have to come over the fence they could not open a gate
and I still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there
if I don't hear him playing I get up and come out and look out the window real often so and watch I don't blame you
it's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids but you do better safe than sorry and if they find who's doing that to those little girls as far as I'm concerned he could fry he could fry
to put it very bluntly he could fry
because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder
and I believe that and this is one of them
because these little girls will never be the same that's terrible
never be the same so I don't know it's really scary and I don't know what needs to be done it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail and when they do put them in there I'm taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases
and he said if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to they're going to serve about a quarter it's going to be reduced
they'll serve a quarter of it
so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred
because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty which is really
I don't know it just doesn't seem right
it doesn't it doesn't they just get out there was a thing on what are we going to do about it? how can it be changed unless the legislature will do something I don't know and they don't seem to
that's the thing we're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude
and we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period period and do it
and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life
we're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years we're really going to do it
it's just the system has just and I understand they're doing it because the prisons are full but somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build more and keep these people in them I think so
I think it would be worth it everybody
I was watching a show about this the other night and they were
are you on any kind of regular exercise plan?
I do aerobics step classes and toning classes step classes? what's that?
it's a new form I think it's like low impact aerobics but it instead of hopping and jumping you just step and
you have a step and you literally step up on the step and move your arms it's new it's fun I probably couldn't do that because of my knee bad knee
and I do toning a lot and some every once in a while I play tennis
I'm not too great at it but I try to play I've kind of gotten out of the habit myself it's I guess what I do now is I play softball right now
that's about right now I'm on two teams so it's four nights a week
so I enjoy it but as far as
instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there I went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it
I need to make myself do that
I slacked off a little because of I'm about to graduate from college and so this past couple months have been really hectic so I haven't really gone and I've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out but what school you going to?
I'm at east carolina
but I my step classes and toning is about the only thing what's toning? is that lifting weights?
it's isolated movements for certain muscles groups you can do with isometrics stuff like that
you can do it with weights if you wanted to but you leave out of there usually the next morning if you haven't done it in a while you wake up the next morning you're what did I do to myself and your whole body aches
I know I'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape I feel like I'm out of shape but I feel guilty for not going because I'm so used to going for three or four years now
I stayed in pretty good shape during school
but I played baseball all the way through
and working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape
but ever since I got out of school just jumped right into the job and I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule
because I work some weird hours and do some traveling
some I walk a lot because being in school we
I don't know if your campus was anything like ours but our parking lot's in one end of the campus and the buildings are all at the other end you I didn't have much of a problem I guess I went to a small baptist school and we had about maybe thirteen hundred people
that's if so it's pretty small
but I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant
it's I live on the second story apartments so I walk up and down stairs all day long
we've got a one story house now that's enough I guess I push the lawn mower around that's fairly regular
that's one of the exercise now
I would like to start running I've never been much of a runner but I want to start I want to run but I don't know if I'll be able to do it what just because you don't like to or because you won't be able to
I'm afraid I won't be able to if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running I wish I'd
I hope not we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough
I don't even own a bike I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve I don't know I'd be afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike you can't forget how to ride a bike
I guess that's about the only form I'm trying to think of other things that I do that will be considered exercise
there are things I should do I know it when I was going to I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred when we were at this junior college our coach we one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting
so they it was a regular we had it for course credit
but still it was pretty high impact stuff
those aerobic classes are tough the high impact
definitely are tough classes and she'd most of the guys were all in one class so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally
first at eight we had eight o'clock in the morning was our class wake up
now they have those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for toning instead of using a weight
you have bands I don't know if you've seen them
they're weird I think my wife has some
they're just made of different kinds of rubber
and they get or sand even some of them they're elastic so I guess it wouldn't be sand
and there's some that the different colors denotes how much the tension they are and how easy they are to move
I know there's purple gray and green and some of them are real short and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use
but those classes I enjoy I think with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun if you don't have one that's fun and not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out what they should get out of the class
if the are you going to get into instructing? what are you studying?
I'm an interior design major not in the aerobic instructor type field
I could never do that
I'd rather just be the student and occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights just
some of the nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups with those things
but they are I don't know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back
I just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it makes you do it and it tells you if you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you and stuff like a turtle goes faster
and it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you a little negative reinforcement there while you're going
so do stuff like that but just I've never used those machines I just use the regular machines and the free weights like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights
just to do some bicep tricep exercises sit ups of course that's where I'm really starting to get noticeable
I'm just getting real soft in the middle
I think that's number one problem with everyone I haven't really started to put on a lot of weight I guess I probably put on about nine or ten pounds since I stopped playing which was about four years ago
but I just notice myself just real soft and I'm sure I don't have near the endurance that I did
but I keep saying I intend to get back into it
I just need to put the old nose to the grindstone I guess at that point it would turn into a task
I don't consider it fun doing that but
I plan on getting back once I graduate next weekend next weekend? next weekend
one week then I plan to get right back into it it does a lot for you I think
makes you feel a lot better there's no question the end result is great and I enjoyed we when I was playing ball we could run all day and not be tired
and you feel so much better about yourself
just that you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner I still don't but that's a problem
good luck on your graduation and your
thank you it was nice talking to you you too
I don't know how much I know about this subject I don't know if I know anything or not
but I've got some opinions on it
go ahead those type of people that have the most opinions ones that don't know anything
I've had teenagers and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective I think this me' generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed and I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint
that's true I personally know nothing about the peace corps though
me either I went to college and then started working and then got married and but they have I read somewhere and I'm out on a limb here some type of college volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the lower income brackets of the united states have you ever heard about that one?
I haven't I know that my sister I have a twin sister and when they graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south texas and I know that if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much they cancel part of your college note or whatever
if it's really a lower paying job where in a small town you don't need as much as far as to live and this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?
she only taught there one year but I but she got credits for it?
that's very interesting
and I think it would be I know that also one of my cousins who he is in the therapy type thing and he was some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at it's a nursing home or something like that
so if I think that's a good way for people to maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want I think that is an excellent program I really do I like that and it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the metroplex
as far as getting doctors and all that stuff if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
but we could find one
we wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that
so I can see the advantage to that one the peace corps itself is really dying out isn't it?
I really don't know that much about it I think of the peace corps more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when it's still in existence
and don't they go into other countries and stuff? I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm dig their own wells set up their schools
things that make the
make them more self supporting? they
it's not a program to teach them to use the american money it's a program to teach them to be more self reliant
and you're right I think it's a sixties program I think it was one of kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal
but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it I think I've singled out my grandchildren but actually they're pretty good along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad
but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good but there's a
I don't know that you could require everyone to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that mandatory just like the draft
I don't know that that would work if somebody didn't really want to be there and didn't have every time you they could buy their way out
there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but I'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out can you go into and this wasn't the question but it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults can they go in there and can anyone go out of the kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time but I think bangladesh would have been a good example or some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good
I don't know that it does I don't know that if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
we're losing certain races of people
there are people now that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people that are endangered or obsolete
and I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out there's a german word for it that's elegant but I never can remember what it was but they're being winnowed because where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially
and one of the quick examples is the aborigines
when we were in australia sad little things I felt sorry for them because their society isn't there anymore and their belief system and all the structures of their society are gone essentially
and they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else and that's sad
but I don't think there's any way the peace corps could go in and rescue those people and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
so I'm wondering if the peace corps is really an effective tool down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and could be helped good point
we've got enough without a passport there's plenty
I think we ought to worry about our own species
and maybe rather than just require somebody to join the peace corps for a year maybe during college maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the united states I wonder now in and I've been out of school too long to answer this but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses
there probably are for but I'm sure that's probably people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something and realize it's everybody's responsibility to help these people and I'm not saying just give them money but because they have to be taught to be that's the last thing you want to do
I know that's what my father in law was talking about when you give these people money or what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give more money to these people and that's not really the answer because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on booze or something like that that's exactly it
but they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it come on let's be realistic
that's just not realistic
or to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves
I guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but we're not I think that's more realistic than making them go in the peace corps it's
I think that's a lot more realistic I think that we should be spending more time and again I don't think the peace corps is as successful now simply because it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore
we've got plenty in fact we've got far too many you're in flower mound?
flower mound so we're a little farther removed from dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing I was that's exactly what I was going to ask you have you been downtown
first I need to know how do you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home?
of course it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do unless it's just really for their own good
I'd be very very careful checking them out our had place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about eight months ago
and I was fortunate in that I was personally acquainted with the people who ran the nursing home in our little hometown
so I was very comfortable in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there's I had an occasion for my mother in law who had fell and could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience it had to be done in a hurry we didn't have six months to check all of these places out and it was really not very good deal
we were not really happy with nursing home that we finally had
fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to return to her apartment again but it's really a big decision as to when to do it
is there something else we could have done in checking out all the places that might be available of course there's not one on every corner especially smaller areas smaller towns
probably the hardest thing in my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home and she had used the walker for quite some time probably about six to nine months and she had a fall and finally she had parkinson's disease
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house
then she lived in an apartment and that was even harder actually
because it was just a change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling
she had children all across the united states
and she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
and that was pretty heart rending for her
I can imagine I think when she finally came to the realization that I can not take care of myself
that's tough that's tough for somebody who for most of their life has not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines
and facing that situation it's quite a dilemma I think
my mother go ahead my probably one of the biggest decisions that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it
I think that they had a great deal of all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference
that's great and it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that
that's right and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and making that decision and then finding a place
and everybody had duties to perform
whether it was just giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot of the decision making like finding a proper nursing home you were very fortunate and they
I know and they had seen it coming
so it I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
unfortunately a lot of times responsibilities like that seem to fall to maybe one child in the whole family we
and it's usually not a very smooth thing
I was lucky too that I only have one brother
and fortunately we agreed on exactly what we thought should be done my mother also was very independent she still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty three
we were lucky in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really much aware of what was going on
that nursing home life would not have been anything of her choosing of course she would not have been happy there at all
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us with my grandmother it was such that she did not have the problem with she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her
at least her daughter came and visited her and also her several grandchildren came and visited her every day
that's great and I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest I think it would be it was more of a relief for her
and but she was truly aware I don't know how I would deal if one of my parents came with alzheimer's or something like that which is far more devastating that would be tough
and I think that one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily the quantity of care but the quality of care
that the people that worked there were very interested to make it as close a home environment as possible
it would I think for myself I see that as probably what everything would hinge upon
is it how close is it to a home environment
that's right that's probably the major question
I think that great strides are being made nowadays in caring for the elderly in a whole lot of areas
just people are of course populations getting older it's interesting that the population of the united states is changing because now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families it wasn't
but I guess as we become more industrialized and less in a rural situation we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier that's right
and things are scattered so much nowadays
I think that perhaps the extended family it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care
of course there comes other issues whether we feel like they're going to be a good caretaker for our children but
just because they're grandparents they raised us after all
just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer but I think that I've had a lot of good experiences with many people especially where they've had extended family and I kind of see that perhaps we may need to get close to the family environment and get down to the values of
it's money seems to be too big of an issue with what's going on today
realistically it is and I think that may be perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem
that would certainly help we may not have as high a standard of living
but actually have a truer standard of living
that's just a matter of defining priorities or some priorities anyway
I think you're right I guess that was it
it was good talking to you take care
do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote? I think it's somewhere really close to that cause I think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore
because they feel like so many of the politicians are crooked?
and so they figure why go out and vote they're going to do what they want to do they're corrupt anyway and I think one of the good ways of solving that is everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something
that's the only thing that I can figure out because I've heard so many people say I'm not voting on that one I'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if I don't vote and I think it does we vote every time
there's no question it does make a difference so far as having a party and then all voting when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct
because people have to vote in different areas and not everyone votes at the same place
I personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up with the idea of the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference but and maybe let them have some mock elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young
that's a real good idea
and they are doing that in a number of schools however probably not enough of them country wide
but it's going to take at least a whole generation of people to get across the idea of voting just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally realize the harmfulness of drugs and hopefully to now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs
how to say to it and what have you that perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it but I spent thirty four years in education here in the dayton area
and in nineteen fifty one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you to get them started
and that was in fifty one that's forty years ago that it was already a problem
so it's now to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it and we've neglected the value of voting and what it really means to vote
and we also don't make the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them I don't know how it is up there but down here louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all
I'm sure you heard about some of ours
and people are just it's like they're turned off on voting and that's the reason I said maybe if you had something like a block party
we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote we're going to go vote maybe they could give something the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that it could be a sign that they would put down at the end of your block or anything like that
but it's really bad here to me it is it seems like people just don't care anymore they say it don't make any difference one crook is as good as the other one
and they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say
and I know my husband we go vote every time I don't care how small the ballot is if there's one thing if there's one issue
because the way I feel is if I don't vote then I don't have any reason to gripe
to complain about it
and I hear so many people saying I wish this would change I wish that but they didn't go vote
that's right and like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all and the importance of it because if you don't vote for your friend over here your friend's not going to have a chance that's right
he needs your vote just like he needs everybody else's maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would because I know here until you get into high school then they had the voting machines and you voted for cheerleaders and different things like that
but they should start that a lot earlier
I it's the same way with everything in education though it should begin right down in the first grade and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children develop good learning patterns and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning and not wait until they're in high school
and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point
but everything should be started on the lower levels and certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians
and perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run that only the most wealthy can do so
and they're not always the best person for the job
but they have the money to be able to do it so that there are a lot of problems along that line also
and perhaps the government a good idea for the young kids like that too is to have a mock one and this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen
and this candidate tells you some things
then the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people elect do
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them now you're not going to get to vote but you're going to have to do what that person says
they would understand probably by the time they were in high school
they'd be ready to vote
that's right and I think that's an excellent idea they would put them to realize that they're going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it and that maybe they need to think twice about voting
some people object during primaries having to declare a party whether republican or democrat
and you do that in the primary
and I don't know that a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason they can declare anything they want and they can actually rig it if they really wanted to vote republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the republican could beat but it's just a sad situation and I do think more needs to be done along that line to help to teach everyone more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting so that they're making some more intelligent decisions and it's going to take these young I think that sounds great
it's going to take a whole generation of my feeling before that's going to be accomplished they'd have to start when they're real young
that's right it would have to be a child that is just coming into school because I'll tell you another thing too now the first time I voted I never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines
this sounds dumb but I did not know how to use those voting machines and nobody ever showed us or anything so I didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them
they thought that was funny she don't even know how
so there wasn't any way I was going to go in there and vote and it took such courage you wouldn't believe to go vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I didn't know how to work the machines
it is that's bad and I was out of school I was a married person
and I didn't know how to work the machine and it really scared me really bad because I thought all these people are going to laugh at me because I don't know how to work this machine where if they'd had a class or something or said this is the way
just the opportunity to try the voting machines it's this is the way it's going to be and my son was exactly the same way that I was and I didn't realize it until his senior year I asked him something about who did you vote for for cheerleader? and he said I didn't go vote he said there's no way I'm getting in that machine then I realized it so when we went and voted the next time I asked the lady I said I want my son to come in with me and she said why he'll have to come back out I said because I want him to know how to use one of these
and I said I won't turn any of the buttons down but I want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote
so he went in and now he's a registered voter good but he would not vote before then
and I think that's bad
sure it is here I was and even of course there's a lot of years between the two of us but even with that many years between
what's the it has a death penalty doesn't it?
they just started it again too just late or within the past few years for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty but now it's coming back into favor
they find it is more deterrent my sociology class at s m u's taught us that it was not a deterrent but now that's just what they said I don't know maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent
if you compare the figures I think that's where they're coming from maybe they've changed their minds
the maybe that's it maybe that's it because that was back in the seventies
they are that was before they adopted the death law again but I myself am in favor of it particularly for crimes murders related with drugs or killing a policemen I think I agree but I think it ought to be expanded to include children I think they're working on something in austin now
and I'm not sure what it is I just remember seeing a kind of a synopsis of it
why stop at children? why not go to adults too? I'm personally very in favor of it
why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried to or given their best effort at doing that
I don't care to support them
I don't either but there is something to be said about or just for the sake of argument I'm taking a con
I'm against it you know yourself how many times have you heard where a citizen was wrongfully arrested and served time at a penitentiary
just recently this black man served nine years for robbery and then there was the black woman that robbed and shot the furrier and she was set free too just in two examples in texas recently
but she actually killed the furrier or someone she was charged with murder and then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something I didn't retain all those facts very well but I know what you're what if we make a mistake that's it and that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything
right now our laws are so liberal that even with the death penalty in effect I don't think that they're going to use it too frequently unfortunately I like you say yes let's have it give them all a shot get rid of them I guess though where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty
why should they be sitting in prison getting their college degree
that's tougher it's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that the death penalty's the way to go it's a deterrent to crime they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway but to be one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me
very true I agree with you there I think I'd probably do it but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance that's a real easy thing to say that I would but I don't know
I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that that's an awful lot to expect of a person to kill somebody is what it amounts to but that's what they did
it but they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted
and they wanted something more than they respect the human life
I guess we both agree that it should be in effect hang them
I agree it should be in effect also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement so I guess I would say I want it to be in effect but I want maybe I have a problem with this too I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance
that's true just believe in just about any state in the union a death verdict is an automatic appeal that's correct it is it is
and I'm inclined to agree with you I think so there should be a limit as to the number of appeals there's some and maybe I don't remember if this is texas or not that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence
not just for dealing in drugs convicted drug dealers it what's the
there are certain circumstances and I don't remember what they are they're on the distribution end
they're not selling them they're distributing them it's for the large dealers is what it's reserved for
and they are in effect killing people
I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs
I think that's the way it's worded is that how it's worded? I knew it was there but I or is it proposed or is it passed?
I do believe that's in I wouldn't swear to it myself I believe it is
but I thought it was in effect I believe you're right though I think it is and I have to agree with that
I think it certainly should be one of the options I've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that I know I qualify that heavily because you never know but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet
but it just touches so many young people my children are about in the same age bracket
it does I have four sons myself and the youngest is twenty eight
so they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it going through high school and everything and knock wood that they have not I won't say they didn't try it I wouldn't know but they I doubt very much that they're using it now in fact I'm sure they don't I think the oldest is thirty two and the youngest is probably twenty seven twenty eight
it's the same age bracket
and there's four two girls and two boys and I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot
and I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge
that's usually the way it is it's just try it out with their peers and none of them even smoke they don't they never strangely enough their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up my ex wife she quit when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again and I just quit about fourteen months and two weeks ago that's tough
it is I and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by my husband hasn't quit yet and he knows he has to and he knows he should and he knows and he knows
but he hasn't I do respect the fact though that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me he's very conscious of passive smoking and he's concerned about it but hasn't quite made it yet
when I was still smoking I felt that way
if I was in a public restaurant seated at table with non smokers I would try to pick my seat where the smoke would blow away from them or I'd hold the cigarette under the table I've seen all of this
but now the shoe's on the other foot I'm aware of other people smoking now charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own
he will get up and he'll go outside and he's so when we're invited to people's house he will not smoke in their house which I think is good because there's a lot of people that are very
particularly if they have children
and he tries his best but the actual quitting he hasn't done he changed brands to a brand he doesn't like he put up all of his ash trays he will not smoke in a comfortable position but still he's done everything the smokers anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking it's a long process
there's a trick I use
they used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment how neat
and every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one one at a time and that gets to be a deterrent he has his in the kitchen
do you vote regular?
I do I try and vote in every single election every one
but that's just in the past about six years before that I really didn't pay any attention at all that's me I've never paid any attention to voting you haven't?
I didn't use to but now I really because I get so angry about what goes on and then I feel like I can't really complain too much unless unless you have something to do with it
but the problem is that I am very liberal politically and so I hardly ever have anybody that wins that I vote for liberal what do you mean by liberal
liberal politically I'm pretty left wing democrat so I don't know anything about politics
you don't? what's the main difference between republicans and democrats?
there's a lot of them it depends on what issue you're talking about but democrats on a lot of issues are more liberal than republicans and it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after desert storm but I think back in the times when my political opinions were being formed during the vietnam war and stuff the republicans were more what they called hawks which is more aggressive in war and more pro war and pro aggression
and the democrats were the doves they were more for peace and I'm not sure how much that holds true anymore I think the issues are and you vote for the democrats or usually
and democrats usually are more supportive of public assistance programs
and programs to the big republican thing is that they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society
and so they're less apt to vote in more aid to people or more they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things
have you ever voted at all? I never have you haven't? how old are you? I'm twenty six I know I
I don't know that much about it
I don't keep up on it and I don't feel like I have enough knowledge on it to pick the right person
so that's what they need they said something to improve voting
if they could make it easier to find out what's going on do you know what I mean?
to me I didn't know what would have been wrong with I can't even remember who ran for president against bush I think it was that woman wasn't it a woman
it was dukakis from massachusetts dukakis
didn't he have a woman or was that reagan there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while that was ferraro
ferraro that was a while ago that was a couple elections ago
that's okay that's what I mean I didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was
I didn't know anything about bush or dukakis
what do you think about what you see on t v about them in the news or on the ads do you kind of just I don't remember anything about dukakis
you don't? but they're all saying that they're going to do whatever is best for their campaign anyway
that's what I mean if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and
I don't know in school they didn't teach you about the government not really
you didn't get any government classes?
it's really hard too because before they used to have a lot of it seems like the stuff that they put out now it doesn't just seem like it I know for a fact that any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material what do you believe in what do you believe in they don't take any stands on anything they kind of say what do you want me to believe
or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues I'm not sure they're I know how they do it
it with the abortion issues and stuff
they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and things like that so that's kind of how I judge there's a few things where they have to say like abortion or gun control or let me see I try to look at if some of the newspaper articles or the I don't trust t v as much but newspaper articles can show how they voted in the past but you get
it all depends again on who's writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too and like I said most of the politicians I'm also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway
and everybody's got stuff they don't want known
everybody's got a secret so I'm sorry I didn't have much knowledge
that's okay do you think I don't even remember this being on there
what would it take this is really good actually to talk to somebody who hasn't voted what kind of incentive?
what kind of stuff would you like them to do so that you would know more about it send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or I guess that would be good I'm sure they've got it at the library
if I get to the library I've got two babies so I don't
do you? that will tie you down a little bit but I don't know
or do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote or I know if enough people think like that it would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that
a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes
since you're democrat? then your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat not in my family
we're really independent all split
but a lot of families do that I know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved I lie
but I don't know if I did understand politics I probably would vote more
but like I said if I voted for bush or when gary hart was running a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking hart?
not that I think he was good looking but he was young
and then I didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever
because it what he had an affair
and it just threw him out of the whole running
and a lot of people go by their personal life when they vote and
which I guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work but I'm sure there's a lot of people that have had
I think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it
and I that's very true I think that doesn't really have that much to do with unless they've done something really horrible or something real abnormal
criminal or something like that's different
but if him and his wife weren't getting along but otherwise
what effect does that have on him running for president do you know what I mean?
it's all so secretive we really don't see the true person anyway that's right
I think that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run that the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job
but they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no and if they don't say yes or no then maybe somebody will vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what I'm saying?
so they just try and make it a personal thing if you remember any of the t v commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had pictures of bush walking around with his grandchildren and even from reagan it looks like a mcdonald's commercial
that's about what it looked like what did you think of reagan as a president?
I just thought he was really inept I don't think he did anything at all they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were do you think he won from carter because of the hostages that were held at that time?
I think that was part of it I think there's a lot of the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the recession and stuff
people just had a picture of carter as not being real capable but he actually this I thought he was great I thought carter was good too and that was
did you? I always liked him I thought he was great at the time and I just couldn't get over the fact that reagan beat him I just couldn't believe that he got voted out but I think I wasn't let's see that's been about ten years ago?
so I was only fifteen or sixteen but I remember carter and I liked him
you did? have you heard stuff about him lately do you know what he's doing? I sure don't
he is really active still politically he's been overseas you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the middle east for
jay where do you live in texas? I live in dallas in dallas
right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state and it goes east and west and a north south tollway what's that the I thirty and central express?
it's it's called six thirty five's the highway
it's the looper that goes around the city
and then the tollway is called the dallas north tollway
just moved here about a month ago after twenty one years two miles to the east is that right? how about that?
so it's a very different house from the typical dallas house it's a new home? it's about eight years old about eight years
it's a duplex type thing very modern and very open and light
so it's different than the long texas ramblers
we live in a brick story and a half what's your house like? cape cod style I guess you'd call it
and have a big sun room on the back of it
so it's got a lot of openness and light also?
it doesn't? it doesn't have
that's what my wife really wanted and so with openness and light?
that's I understand that I would love that too
our last house wasn't too bad but it was just too traditional
and so if this is very traditional
the next time probably a year and a half from now we're going to try to build
so make one really contemporary and very modern and very open and very light do you have children at home?
I have three in college three?
they usually get back at least two of them for the summer but you still need space plenty of space
still need a little bit of space we have a lot less than we had recently already cut back
how big is your place? it's about twenty five hundred square feet I guess that's good size it's four bedrooms and two baths and that
we had it has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room and then the big room on the back
we had four bedrooms two and a half baths in the place we just left
so now we're down to two and two two and two
so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home but it won't be that long because we not sure
I was just reading an article that there were nineteen thousand properties available in texas for sale by the resolution trust corporation? repossessed
and if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal I guess so
we really didn't go that route and didn't look but the planning of them and the housing market probably still going to even go lower there are many houses for sale just by the regular route
that's discouraging if you own property
and we just decided sell and we got a pretty good price for what we had not as good as it would have been three or four years ago few years
but that was just the timing our daughter and son in law moved back up here about a year and a half ago and had their house on the market down there
and they never did sell it so they stayed six months and she got her job back and he got a job down there because
they're not moving very well for sure
and that's a good example of it they live in rowlett
I know where that is we've been here for twenty five years have you?
I'm from missouri and my wife's from kansas so I teach at a college here
so it's sort of home now
what college are you teaching at?
I'm at one of the it's called brookhaven college it's one of the community colleges
and it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living so it's very nice very convenient the only one I know is richardson
richland college it serves richardson and garland garland
and that's about nine miles to the east of here
so it's good to hear from you I enjoyed talking to you
and I hope we did them some good on their little computer dealy I hope so
and have a good life the rest of it thank you same to you
lynn do you want to start? certainly
do you want to tell me about summer vacations you've taken or
I tend to take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight seeing and things like that which is your favorite?
I couldn't live without the family vacations but my favorite is the indulgent ones where we go off and see places that have interested me since I was a kid for the most part
and your family doesn't live close then?
not anymore they've been in san diego for the last few years and they're moving to florida
and that's one of those things you just have to go once a year I understand
basically it sorts out into that and then about once every three or four years I try to get over to england because I lived there for a while some years back I've only been there once
and I'd love to go back beautiful country beautiful country and it was beautiful people it
but and I'd really like to go because I'm fairly recently married we had a great time
and my husband has been hearing about these people for years but he's never met them so I'd like to do that but that's our typical vacation and we enjoy the family vacations but the other ones are very special getaways and we probably take one of each every year how about yourself? we as you do take family vacations sometimes one a year but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons but vacations we really enjoy I think we've been on three cruises
I've never been on a cruise and we really love cruises we've gone on carnival cruise lines
and we've gone fairly inexpensive as most cruises go we usually book just a month before it's ready to go
and we get upgraded last two times in fact we had an outside room and it was beautiful
and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around it's kind of
what do you do on a cruise? I've never been on a cruise you do everything
you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be you can sit in the sun all day around the pool or you can take part in the games that they have going on they always have bingo they have a casino they have a massage parlor they have exercise you can do anything
and that's just aboard ship and then when the ship docks you get to go sight seeing and shopping
and that's quite fun
and where have you been on these cruises? nassau san juan saint thomas we've been there twice we went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people we've gone with friends each time
I see and then we went to the western caribbean which is port cancun cozumel and ocho rios
the mexican coast pardon me?
that's all mexico I think but it was wonderful so we really like those and I guess we just like to go someplace entirely different we've been to a few places in this country we still have a lot to see though where are you from originally? we're from illinois originally
and we've been down in texas eighteen years and so like you we always try to make it back home to see the relatives we both still have family there
and that's fun it brings back a lot of memories
things are different there though they're I don't know it's just entirely different world than this area
I grew up in dallas so it's not like I'm going home did you?
my parents retired first to san diego
and they're going now to florida and so they're going very nice places thank god that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know I really came to love san diego and feel very comfortable there
they've been there eight years
and I just grab the car and drive everywhere that's great
it is nice but it's not home this is home and I've never thought about a cruise it's so funny they really are as I said we've done them three times we'd be going again this year if circumstances hadn't changed we'd probably go
my husband would the minute I said the word he's chomping at the bit he kind of likes the casinos a little bit
but I like all of that what's the best part from your point of view? I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places
I like shopping I can shop anyplace shop in london and france and wherever now my kids are moving to toronto so we're going to be able to go up there
that will be nice so I'm kind of looking forward to that except I hate to see them go but
don't go in the winter that's what everybody says and I think it's I think I'll try to stay away except my second grandchild will be born in the winter in january
so that will be hard to stay away from
there are exceptions made for special occasions like that
but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of texas in the summer isn't that the truth
that sounds wonderful I guess I would contemplate going on a cruise all circumstances permitting it there's all age groups too and that's kind of fun if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people
you may meet people thirty years older than you or younger and everybody is really interesting and everybody is there to have a good time and
how long are the cruises? we've only gone on the seven day cruises
they have shorter ones and then they have ten day ones but I think seven days is long enough for us by that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine
I think most vacations seven days is enough for us we've gone I think when we went to england and france we were there ten twelve days and that was pushing it a bit
I tend when I spend enough money to go overseas I go for a long time
that makes sense it really does we went to panama too
that's interesting went to panama last august
our son in law is from panama
and we went with our daughter and son in law to visit his parents who live there
and his father is a doctor and his mother is a kindergarten teacher and they took time off it was their winter and they were having a little break so they took some time off that they could show us around and it is a beautiful country
it is beautiful they have mountains we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore
that's really nice and it is gorgeous they live in a small town called david which is northern panama up near costa rica
and it's just a gorgeous country most people don't realize it I think if they could get tourists coming to their country they'd improve the economy considerably
maybe now things are calming down again that will happen we really hope so that's really great
as I said basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents and that's pretty good that's pretty good
and my husband had a conference in l a so we spent a week in l a and of course do you like l a?
I'm very unusual I like
have you lived in this area long?
I've only been here a couple of years
but I've noticed that this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year you see a little bit more rain by mid february we start getting a lot of rain
I remember last year or the year before we had ice and snow but it
terrible ice storm around this time of the year
and this year it's been so hot and sunny it's really quite amazing unseasonable my wife and I we used to live in san antonio couple years ago
and it was the first day of spring it was so much ice that came down later on that afternoon and evening it was horrible I was just talking to my son today he's up in boston
and it was twenty nine there and it was in the seventies out here and it was really
he really wished he could be here rather than there I don't know I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather
I like it warmer I like it warm but it doesn't really matter I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly but
I have I I think it's really been delightful I've spent most of my time in warm weather areas and the ice and snow just doesn't hold any allure for me at all I spent three years in germany so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
but I got used to it it was really strange when we came to san antonio it was just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to dallas and it was just it's not that it's just hot or dry it's just not very comfortable it just
do you think san antonio is more comfortable than dallas a little bit
you must it must be quite a bit hotter down there isn't it? my wife and I the last day we were in florida visiting my parents and my brother and sister we were down there and the last day right before we left I had to ride with my sister and the air conditioning went out on the car
and you just get used to air conditioning all the time
and this it was just the humidity was eighty percent plus and it was just killing us
it's terrible orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat
that's really bad I guess I've been in some places where the weather was just so mild places like monterey california or
just so mild and then you've been to such extremes like san angelo texas where you walk outside and you sweat you're sweating
you look down at your arm but you see the water leaving your arm it's so hot you just feel it pulling away bizarre
I know I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate
it doesn't some people say they like to watch the changing of the seasons but I'd rather like southern california have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
so it's kind of a luxury I tend to agree but I don't know I think in some respects it probably more tolerable
I guess the weather isn't as lively a topic as some of the others we might have gotten the other topics I got one topic they said talk about the middle east
I guess we're supposed to say good bye or something and think about what my daughter is here prodding me to say good bye we messed up the conversation anyway I've had some pretty controversial topics so it's just that was my fault but then the weather's it gets pretty mundane you can only talk about the situation just so long
I know weather's just not all that inspiring it's nice talking to you
what do you think are some current trends in the way families spend time together based on what you've seen
I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together
I think in my situation today on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together my husband's been off doing his thing all day today and I've been off doing my thing all day and I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning
so are you newly married or
two years same situation here I've been married about ten months so I know what you mean
it's really hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and you both have hobbies that are different
if you have hobbies that are the same then you can enjoy your hobby together but my husband and I have different hobbies is he a hunter and a fisher and all that
he's a record collector and a hot wheels collector that's wild
so he was off today looking at records
and I was off doing household type things laundry
and did some shopping and stuff from the people I've talked to a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers where they could manage their own schedule and they could spend more time with their kids
because they look back and they're all kind of regretful I think
I think that would be the ideal situation
I think that would be the ideal situation I think that a lot of people in my case I do shift work
I don't have that choice same here
I have to be at work at x hour at a certain hour and it's not flexible
it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours and maybe after we decide to have kids I might find a job that has flexible hours I hope so anyway but I don't know at t I is that where you work?
it's really kind of sad some of the people that I work with when I worked on second shift their kids go to school during the day and then they wouldn't see them at night because they would be at work and the kids are all ready in bed
and so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something
so it was really sad that a lot of families have to have dual income a lot of people choose to which is fine
but then the kids kind of suffer
it would be nice to be able to just have like back in the old days back when I grew up
the mom stayed home and raised the kids my mom didn't go back to work until I was in junior high school
so she was there pretty much all my formative years
and that was nice and I liked that and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids
but I think with the way the future is economy wise I don't think it's going to be realistic I know unfortunately that's probably true do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids are do you think it's more like watching t v and stuff like that not really
I think very few spend quality time I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff like that
I think that most kids that I see they don't really value quality time it's always that way until it's too late
until they're older and then they look back it's true what are some other questions they have I'm not sure I know my parents are growing up I guess they never spent much time watching t v in fact I've never seen my mom turn on the t v we didn't really have one
and they spent a lot of time outside with us and stuff but my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that but I don't know I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time
I think kids now a days are raised on t v t v s a surrogate parent
that's a good way to put it
and not a very good one at that that's a pretty good way to put it if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do?
I hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong I hope to be able to spend their growing up years being in the home not having to work and being able to do
I know a lot of people who I work part time also and I a lot of people that I work for are mothers that stay home
and they do a lot of volunteer work and they're real active in the community and they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working
and I'd like to be able to do that I'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids do volunteer work and be in clubs and stuff
I agree I hope that happens in my case
but I think that's for the few and far between I think that probably ninety percent of the parents out there are probably working parents
and I don't really see that trend changing much if anything I think there's going to be fewer and fewer single income families I know
and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids that may not necessarily be consistent with yours
I don't even know what day care is really all about because I never went to a day care center
I never had that kind of experience I don't even think we had I don't even remember them being around when we were little
it seems like that's a big trend in the last ten years day cares have popped up and become a lot bigger part of the kids lives
it's like a home away from home for a lot of them is I guess we could ring this off since we've exhausted all of our ideas we seem to agree
I think this is a good closing point so
it was really nice talking to you you too I wish you the best you too
donna you said you have three children what kinds of activities do you spend with them? is it?
we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and my husband he coaches basketball with brian
so he spends time doing that with him planning and practicing outside
he's a real sports kind of person so he plays tennis with the kids we all kind of play tennis as a family except the baby plays in the playground
we take turns with her let's see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer let's what else we do plus we watch a little t v together we really don't watch as much t v as a lot of people
we don't have h b o we do get the disney channel for the kids
my kids have a nintendo which they play and my husband sometimes joins them with that
my little girl jennifer likes to do crafty things and I'll take some time and do that with her and of course we always read a bedtime story at night and even the older kids sometimes sit down and will join in and listen to a story I'm basically the story person because my husband doesn't have
he gets home from work late or whatever and once in a while he'll read the story to little one but that's basically my job
so do you find it difficult to find time or is it pretty natural?
it is it is hard because at the end of your day you want time for yourself
and it and that's kind of cutting into your time
and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed at ten which really is late
but on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine they go upstairs at nine and now this weekend we'll have a baby sitter come and my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home probably not too late
maybe brian will still be up and spend some time with him but it's really hard you have to be a very unselfish person to spend a lot of time with your kids I think do you work during the day?
I don't work last year I had a little part time job in a private high school tutoring high school students with learning disabilities
that was two days a week and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot I don't know how I admire people that can do it all
but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way I want it kept it is hard I can imagine
even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything
and that's another thing I'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping usually on the weekend and that's kind of a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son and they'll be my helper and then they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out so I try to do things like that but it's
and then of course they have a pretty busy social calendar too
you fit it in with all that what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general in america?
I think a lot of people set their kids in front of the t v and h b o and rent movies and kind of leave them to their own means
I think it's very very easy to fall into that trap and I'm not totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape
but I think different parts of the country I think in plano and maybe this area in texas there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids people are real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and that's good but
families are facing a challenge I know that with
what I'm a newlywed and we're thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years and
and it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to cut back to one
but if you have the type of job I have a friend that's a nurse and she can pick her hours and
that's a great career I wish I would have gone into nursing
because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to spend time with the children and your husband and do everything at once
but I do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because
I think it's a big responsibility you just don't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single
when you have children you have to say this is different and you do have to give things up I personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child at least for the first two years of their lives if you can possibly swing it because they
what do you think about the school system?
I think they're having a lot of trouble right now I know my son goes to a private school but I think big city public schools by definition are having a tough time right now probably from budget cuts and everything else going on why did you choose a private school?
I had one that needed to be able to be moved along at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school so he has been going to private since kindergarten public school has he?
then how does he like it?
he's loved it he is a senior in high school this year so he's so he's been there all the time
he's done it the whole twelve and so many years and it's been really good for him how big of a school is it?
overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper four grades about four hundred and something so it's maybe a hundred per grade a hundred per grade that's a good size
it really is kind of gives them the I get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids but
we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture and he's done really well so they don't that's good
and he was just ahead at an early age and I didn't feel like what was available particularly in the first three grades
and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program
and I just didn't think that was going get it I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead every day but yet still be with his peers age wise still enjoy the
one thing I think I've noticed is my oldest is in kindergarten so I'm in a little different ballgame you're just getting started I'm just starting her
but seems to me that kids these days can really get away with murder and the teachers aren't respected as much and they have to be so careful of the things they do and say
I know that's a big problem and makes me a little nervous that students don't seem to show that respect and
we wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school
wouldn't have thought of it and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe you wouldn't
and and the things they can say and do to a teacher I think that's wrong I think we need to get back to show some respect and course I guess the teacher used to warrant that but
but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in responsible positions I don't think have had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases for other people and
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands how do you think that that's happened? you think our society's just stopped talking out or this generation's just kind of changed a little bit I guess I
the world changes so obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be
they're exposed to a whole lot more things they have a whole lot more variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time but I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to teach basic values and basic respectful ness of authority
and I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore that just isn't coming through is it
I remember it was a big thing when they let girls wear levi's we used to have to wear dresses
had to wear dresses didn't you? and then you had to go to dresses they had to be a pantsuit and it was polyester and it had to be matching and
and when it was skirts it was get down on the floor and we hold the ruler up here
and it's no more than so many inches above the knee
because it was mini skirt time back there at one time so it's really changed it's really kind of gone the rounds so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree they say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit so I
I think that probably does have something to do with it and it's also this school your son goes to do they require to wear a uniform or
they do not do uniforms although one where he was between second and eighth grade did
there are quite a few of your
what kind of movies have you seen lately?
a lot the last movie I saw was the ninja turtle movie obviously you have kids
that's right but my preference is the one we saw before that was silence of the lambs I haven't seen that one yet
that's an excellent movie the last movie I saw was sleeping with the enemy
was that good I heard I'm not a big julie roberts fan
but I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be
that's good it turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be
it was a pretty good movie
silence of the lambs kept me on the edge of my seat I'm ready to go it just it's hasn't worked out that way yet
it looks good if you like thrillers anyway it is and I do in fact people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards so
I love them like that
I'm not I like all ranges of movies but I like that where they run tense
I really enjoy they keep me guessing the whole time it was really interesting what other movies have you seen then lately?
other than the I assume you were talking about the new ninja turtles
the new one of course is that any good I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to amarillo where my sister lives and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one
so I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon
amarillo I didn't see the first one my husband said it was about the same lines then it won't be too bad
so it wasn't impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been
and I was impressed with the fact that it wasn't that childish
you know what I mean it wasn't my daughter's five she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except r rated and she really enjoyed it but it was on a higher level where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did and I liked that I think that's important if parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi for them too
that's right that's right
it's pretty good but we take her to just about every movie and she does really good we've taken her from real young and she does real good like I said we don't take her to r s so if and when we ever get a baby sitter like we did with silence of the lambs we go see it I's about to say you're not going to take her to that one I'm sure
do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to
what was the last comedy you saw?
what was the last comedy we saw? good question good question we don't get to go that often but something on the tip of my tongue and I can't think of which one it was I can't remember the last in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw
I said that wrong the last movie I saw was the hard way with michael j fox
but that sounds good that really wasn't too bad there were he's supposed he's this actor
and he's playing a cop
or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
there were times when he'd be running with a gun or whatever he didn't look like a cop when he did it and I was so impressed with that because usually that's neat
the part was hard to do that because everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to imitate them or whatever
and I thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far
by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part he was trying to get it
but he wasn't there yet
and you could tell it and I guess that was a real good acting and writing job both or directing job I think they did a real good job of that
and james woods did an excellent job as the cop he just
I like him and there were some definite tense moments with him in there
probably the last comedy we saw now that I think about it is home alone I had seen it before christmas but I took a date to it about a month ago so I've seen it the second time not too long ago so it was really cute I really enjoyed it
of course the bad thing about it was the second time I saw it I didn't really enjoy it as much and I was kind of surprised at that I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over
but before maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time I had laughed so hard I was hoarse
I was hoarse getting out of there
and maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it it just wasn't as funny the second time because I had just gone overboard the first time I don't know but
maybe so maybe so it was a great movie though I loved the movie
I did too I'm looking forward to this summer naked gun two and a half is coming out I love those movies
I do too they are just slapstick
it you have to see those twice to catch everything you have to see them more than that
I still catch things in airplane that I didn't catch it's amazing I do too I love those movies I do too I really do
so I'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do
we try to go a couple times a month to see a movie
it's just getting so expensive isn't it though but that's at least the good thing about the texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper but normally we don't think about it until that's exactly what I was going to say I keep not doing it until after I'm there and then all of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things I know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us easily
and then if you want popcorn and stuff it's incredible
I don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both popcorn is not that expensive nowhere near that expensive
so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke and it's just the idea that these actors live in such lavish style it's as simple as that
we just keep breeding them and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them
I guess so have you seen dances with wolves? that was an excellent movie
I haven't seen we're waiting for the video don't
don't that needs the big screen
it really and truly does because to get the feeling of when they're chasing the buffalos and everything you've got to be where you feel it you really truly do
I would I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too but I'm glad I didn't I really and truly am that was one movie I came out impressed
I really and truly did I have absolutely no problems with them winning seven oscars none at all
normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one movie taking all the honors
I wanted him to win best actor on top of it he was
like I said I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one
but even though they were okay the girl in it they somebody made an interesting observation now that I think back on it I'd say I can't believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what I mean it was just too perfect at all times
that was a mistake that they made they shouldn't have done it
the best the supporting actor he was good but from what I heard the guy who got it was better so I can see that but
you think my daughter would like it? there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side but it's
she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes no problems
it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped the hides so there's
that is the one reason I don't want to see the movie is because I love buffalos for some weird reason but and of course
and I know they're fake and that and plus part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt so they are killing buffalos in it but they don't stress that very much they really don't
and I think it's an excellent movie for if she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good
that'll be good we really need some my husband keeps wanting to it's a long movie
and I heard the video's even going to be longer they did a lot of stuff that they cut out I may have to see the video
that's true they said I hadn't even thought of that
they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length and that they wanted in
so they're going to put it in the video
and that way you can watch it at your leisure I kind of like it when they do that because the video like I said there are certain things you can't do with a video
and the idea that they may put a little extra in it is a good idea
because when you rent a video videos of course are not cheap either
and so the idea of getting a little extra with it is a good idea because they make bundles of money off those things
I know it isn't that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot I do too but not enough
we keep holding out I'm getting to the point where I watch nick at night why don't you go ahead and say what you feel and then I'll respond
I'm very guilty of not doing my part with recycling I'm afraid we recently moved here from north carolina and they had curbside recycling and it was very easy to put everything out there but we don't have it at least in our neighborhood right now
so I've been very guilty about not making the effort to take things where they belong how long have you been here?
we've been here since january so we still feel very new
but it's working up to a year now
so I guess we're old timers compared to some people I think that's a good excuse you need to get into the system a little more and know where to take things
we've been here probably two and a half years and we didn't recycle at all before we came
so I think we're doing well we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now
where do you take those things? the glass and the newspaper we usually take to walmart in behind walmart they have bins
and then we usually save up our cans and change them in for money
where do you do that because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir
but I didn't know where to take them there's a place on parker road it's just over the overpass before you get to k mart I think there's a service station there there's usually a semi truck that has a person there that will weigh them and they aren't worth much right now
but it's better than nothing so
better than nothing and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the pickup now and hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of october
I it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that it's coming in a couple of months and I think it's been delayed
but I think it was originally scheduled for february but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with from what I've read in the mail that we get
and I can't wait for that that will be easy I get tired of newspaper littering the garage
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off but I feel guilty we don't recycle our milk containers because they seem like a big waste
they're a lot of bulk anyway
they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can
so I'll be glad when the bins do come and I think that's when I'll start doing the plastic too
it was real easy with the bins it really was it was just no effort at all no more trouble than taking out the garbage so I've gotten used to washing the salad dressing bottles and things like that
it's not that big of a deal and it's nicer to just throw them out but we can do our part take an extra minute or two
how much do you earn on the cans I didn't know what kind of an idea to give her for when we first were here it was like we'd take maybe a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full
and it would be two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar so it's gone down
which is understandable I think more people are recycling
that's something we don't really make any effort to and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter the cans
and that was kind of fun but we haven't done that for a long time
that sounds like a pretty good project the boys think it's fun plus you get your exercise and you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest but
I'll have to keep myself and get on it my neighbor across the street is so careful about recycling and so I keep telling myself I'll get it organized but maybe they'll beat me and do the city wide first hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you on so
I won't have any excuse then that's for sure it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting trying thinking about it anyway that's all you can do but have you
do they time this thing for us or do we you can do it as long as you want they if it's been long enough five minutes is when they cut in and say we don't have any more room for recording
you can't chat all day so we can say good bye now
it was good talking to you and maybe we'll get on line again sherry
the public school systems everybody has known they've needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it
the first direction that I would love to see them go with kids learn at different rates and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together you'd learn at this rate and that's the only way it's going to happen that's true
you've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it and the other fifty seven minutes you've been talking about a subject you've bored them that's very true I guess I can relate to that because I have two kids that are opposites like that one picks up real quick and the other one doesn't and you're right they do get bored really fast if they already know what you're talking about what do you propose that they do? what is your suggestions?
the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person out of each child out of each child each individual child
some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff other kids are going to be really into math some are really going to be heavy into reading
instead of pushing the scales too far either direction it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff that's
but why not hit the points the kid's really interested in? because if he's interested he's going to study it and he's going to learn it and he's going to remember it that's true I think the only thing that they would argue about that is that every child needs to learn every subject that might be the only thing but I definitely agree with you
they need exposure to every subject they don't need to be masters of it that's true everything I learned about ancient rome has not helped me anywhere in my adult life
I definitely agree there's no doubt about that I can relate to that because I'm going to college right now and I feel like I'm taking this history class and it's so boring and I just hate it and I think why do they make us take this stuff? what does this have to do with getting a computer science degree or whatever?
what type of history class is it that you're having to take? american history we have to take early seventeen hundreds through mid eighteen hundreds and then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present
the early ones they could actually combine two levels of it the one from seventeen hundred til the end of the civil war
combine that into one and then from eighteen sixty five to present and make that your second step because to a point the early parts of it you're giving the foundations of the nation that's basically what they're doing
but even then they're skimming over they're almost trivial with it I agree there's
if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter they make all these people out to be they were great men and they're the father of the country and all this he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else
if not more the man was not a saint that's true this school system thing I tell you I saw something on the news maybe two weeks ago and they were talking about I don't know where you're from but I'm from the dallas area and they were talking about the plano school system that they had one school that if the students did something wrong whether it was behavioral or they weren't learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet with no windows they had not a table but a desk in this closet and they had to sit in there by themselves parents were getting really angry about this because they said why is my child being put in this closet how is that helping my child and the thing they said we're giving them isolation time and this helps them to think but a lot of kids if a child has claustrophobia that's just going to terrify him and
if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded? that's true that's true but they were I definitely agree with parents I think that is a very wrong way to handle disciplining a child putting them in their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms they didn't call them closets but they showed these rooms on the news and they looked like a closet to me with a desk in it real small but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms I said how is this helping? either way I definitely had to disagree with that I think that's not the way to discipline a child by putting him in a closet
as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that the public school system I want to see changed too when I was brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked
then the extreme came in and now we can no longer spank them
so we now isolate them
we've swung the pendulum both ways let's find a middle ground there has to be some sort of discipline and there has to be some sort of punishment short of physically isolating the child and short of physically hitting the child
let's put him into a situation where you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it
but it's going to tax you physically I don't
instead have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school do something to beautify the school property that's true
but you cut the kid's having to give up his quote play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong
but he's seeing something constructive come out of it I have to I think one of the things that can come out of is not just discipline? but for instance one of the things they do at my kids school they have what they call caught being good slips and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good just being excellent they're not cutting up and so on they're just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to they get one of these caught being good slips and then when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to what they call their caught being good store and then they get to spend these like money to me that's positive reinforcement is much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because they're going to be good and try and earn those things to get the positive part of it they'd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked so they're definitely going to work towards being good rather than trying to act up and be bad
I think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself there's been too much negative reinforcement how much like the caught being good slips how about just the john q citizen out there on the street? that's true I think really though that's one thing that my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked but I really do try to use positive reinforcement with them at home also and it really helps and they don't get spanked very often but they do when they deserve it but I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child but that's just my personal opinion and that's not going to I don't think that law will ever change they are never going to let a teacher spank a child again but I don't think some kids don't get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked at home don't you think? I most wholeheartedly agree but I don't know
there's a point of over kill but somewhere you've got to find an even line there's so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can but there are times when a child needs to be spanked they do things that they need that
need that shock effect where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked
what do you do on your yard?
typical lawn stuff saint augustine with a little bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas
and really all I do to it is in fact I didn't even fertilize it this year I just mowed it and I mow it with a mulch mower so the particles fall down comes back in the yard
so you don't have any one do your yard you do it yourself?
I do it myself we do too have a lot of people trying to do it for me isn't that the truth a flyer's on every door every day
I need the exercise so what the heck that's right my husband does the same thing he does the yard and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower but I keep putting off learning
you've got the right idea that's right but I had recently gone out and planted mums we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloway's
and put out yellow and bronze and they're just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town and she says those are going to die just the first frost
she said you should have done pansies and I went now you tell me
so the first night that around halloween and we went out and covered them with a sheet and they did okay that first night but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it so I guess I've lost them I haven't gone out to check yet
I don't blame you I wouldn't want to look at them listen but the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here I guess it was about four years ago and we did not know in august to put down whatever it is for grub worms
and the next spring in that march every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up have you ever seen it what grub worms do?
and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything it took a lot of money and a lot of time so the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazinon
you think that's what it was we found them
we found them we dug under there about an inch and you could see them they're real fat little white things and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
those kind of brown what we call june bugs but in the
and some people call them may beetles june bugs is what I'd heard them called
so occasionally I find them in the flower beds they said that every yard has some
but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem so that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
I had some of that problem but mine was freeze that too two years ago or last christmas is that what you're talking about?
I'm still replacing that in the back especially under the trees kind of slow and very expensive
I caught wolfe with one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents and I bought about twenty of them I guess you did too it's what they've done in the spring or the fall I put
that was late that was because I started to say there's different times they say it's okay to do it
that was september I think
and I had to water it
keep it damp my out here we don't have as many trees in plano at least the area where we're over by collin creek mall but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died and all those variegated things died so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly and they just live
they're pretty tough you can stand those
pittosporum is kind of borderline here
and usually it'll do pretty well but every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals
and it zaps it it's kind of like one of these
wax leaf ligustrum is the same way same way they warned me of that one finally and I said you need to either read neal sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there and we didn't know the difference and every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before like about these mums
next year I'll do pansies your list is growing and my backyard we had it really nice and then my husband wanted a labrador puppy and so it was about I guess he's three now so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio
so it's like our backyard is just kind of like as long as he won't damage it fine and if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there any more
kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds very much but
I had a small vegetable garden that you did
it did pretty well it's on the apron of the parkway out behind the garage
and our garages come in from the alley so do ours
and it's a little piece of land over there what did you grow?
I had tomatoes and peppers and I had okra that is amazing
and by the fence I had cucumbers which didn't do real well
they kind of came out looking like gourds put them in a salad though and you say I made it though at least it's mine
but I had squash I had zucchini and yellow crook neck squash
do you have any recycling programs there?
I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet
we're a pretty small town and the closest thing we have are bins out in front of wal mart that show plastics paper liter bottles et cetera et cetera we've progressed a little bit farther than that
actually they have parts of town it may have even spread all over the whole town and they will have these green bins
and it's just as standard as a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump
and just along with a trash can you have this green plastic bin and you put your bottles in it and paper and all those things aluminum anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin
and I guess you can and a lot of the restaurants they just have places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles
and I don't know I guess they're clear bottles
so a lot of people do have those separated and of course they have the dumpsters the igloos
and they have those strategically placed around the city
and they're actually going to extend it one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and
that would be good things of that nature so I guess when you live in a bigger city it really becomes necessary
it's not anywhere near that
we as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans
but that's as far as we go because I take them to a girl at work and she goes and cashes them in because I can do that for her
and I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it
we don't have anything here in belton it's a pretty small little town I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans and
so that's about all that we're doing here they're getting a little bit more on they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you can't because not a lot of people do really know what it's for
they're doing a real good job of separating it here and of course there you have a specific place to put your paper
and they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but they actually have the door to door pickup and I think it started out to be just kind of a test a pilot project
and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost I don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be but they just go around to each door and pick it up that's excellent
that's good let's see and every year of course the phone books they tell everybody across the city to put all their phone books in the recycle bins
because phone books are pretty for a bigger city they're pretty thick
they are and sometimes you might have two or three
so that's a big savings right there in itself
ours just goes in the regular trash
there's not a whole lot
and there are some places that will set up for old newspapers and stuff
but usually it hasn't caught on yet I'm hoping it will soon the thing about newspapers and paper recycled paper is actually very expensive
so when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that it's they're not coming out ahead at all it's really a cost
I wasn't totally aware of that
it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something aluminum I don't know they may be coming out ahead but I know for a fact that the paper on that end they're not
it's just good to recycle but it's not to their advantage and it costs less
I can't think of anything else
I can't either because we're at a very beginning stages so
we look forward to it to get better I hope you all come along a little farther in the future
me too it was nice talking to you you too
have you ever had a family reunion?
and let me tell you this is a really neat thing to do too that they did I didn't do it some of the other people the older people organized it
and what they did they had a book made up and it was when our ancestors first came over
and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family like how many kids you had and who you had married
and it went through and it showed who my husband's parents were and who he married and then how many children we had and then his brothers and sisters
and it went through the whole family and stuff
that's so neat and it was so good
but it really did and plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of
so did everybody send in their information and they made a book up about it
and then you could get it at the reunion and everybody got a book that came to the reunion
and it told where the first connallys came over
and it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had and it just kept coming on up through the generations
so that was really neat that is neat and
so do you have a big family? he does
he does? he does I don't but he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any
that's kind of how my husband and I are I have a kind of a big family and he just has himself and his brother and his parents
and that's it so he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together that's what happened when I first met my husband I said this can't be nobody can have this many relatives
because a lot of them lived in a group down one highway
and there was a lake and they all lived down there by it
how nice and so we were going down the highway and he kept saying this is where my uncle lives and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle
and I kept thinking this guy is putting me on
nobody has this many relatives
but they really were all there
how funny and another thing that's really good about family reunions is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty and bring it because nobody liked the same thing
but you had a choice and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too and get a lot of good recipes
where if you said a certain thing and say we're all going to have fried fish or we're all going to have fried chicken
everybody might not like that
not be able to do it so did people come from out of town to the reunion or they did they came from all over
did you put them up in other people's houses or did you have hotel rooms or how did you do it? they just stayed with different ones of them
they did they just came down and say this aunt and uncle kip all their kids and their grand kids and everything and then they had it
it had gotten so big that they had it at the church
and they had a church service ahead of it and then they ate out on the ground how nice
and they just brought food with them?
did they just have over a weekend? is that how they did it?
I'm real curious because my family it didn't sound I don't think my family is as big as your husband's I don't think we'd need a whole church but the problem is we are all really scattered around
there isn't any one place where most of us live so if we ever had a reunion we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel there would be one person who lived there that would have a house but they couldn't put everybody up so I think it would get kind of expensive but you know what you can do?
a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located about the same distance for all of you all to come?
they have these places where you can rent them and it on a lake
it's a big place it's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff
and it's not very expensive that way
you mean so I see so everybody could stay together? they have a convention type thing a house or something
and then it has little rooms off of it where you'd go and sleep at night time
but then it has a kitchenette and things like that but you
that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something and another
and then every time you wanted to go eat with somebody you'd probably have to go to out eat or something it would run into a lot of money so but they had that was that that sounds like fun what you can do is you can write different places the chamber of commerce tell them what you're interested in
ask them what they have at area lakes and all if they have something like that
because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the chamber of commerce of where we're going because you can find out so much easier that way than try to locate it you get a
calling different places can really run you up a bill
but if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance you can't get it exact usually
and then everybody goes to that place and that is not bad at all
but lot of times they'll have little cabins
and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have just the single bunk beds and stuff
and they can all stay in those cabins and then you can have cookouts and stuff like that that doesn't cost you as much that would be great
that would be really nice but that's the best way I found because whenever you have something where you go and that sounds good now we had one this was before I lost a lot more of my family but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway because I didn't have any of them left
but they had thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat
but I didn't think that was as good because it was like you couldn't really talk and stuff like you could when you were at the lake or somewhere where you were out
this was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant
and you have to sit at a table and just and it just I didn't like that much
did you was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite did you have to draw a line or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line?
they just whoever wanted to come what they did was they wrote to all the initial people the oldest ones
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones
and they had I think there was four or five different people that would call some of them if they didn't have their addresses and all on them
and they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming
and then when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter to get the information and all it asked will you be willing to bring
and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring
I see and so really there wasn't any problem with that's the reason it ended up in a church because there was just so many of them there
but it turned out so much better like that because they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
if there was a sickness or something like that you're not going to lose that many
that would just be a few
but how about because of divorce and stuff like that? my parents are divorced
and they are both remarried and there's I don't know then if you wanted them both to come then you would have put that down on the list
and you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask for their information
so then to send back to those other people
I'm kind of in control over who comes just from my family because once it went to the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite
then they sent their little things to us
it was up to me whether I wanted my kids and any of my family to come I see so
I see that's a pretty good idea to do it that way and then it never did if I didn't want somebody to come then I just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires
so there really wasn't a problem that way
that's a real good idea
but I tell you what that's the neatest book we've got
I bet course we've still got it and they charged us five or six dollars that we paid for the book to be printed
and it's not a hard back book it's just a folder type thing
but it has the entire it has everybody that you could ever imagine and some you couldn't how neat
I know that's really neat that's really neat and it will be something my kids will have just like
I was just thinking of that what you could tell your kids because if you stop and think I don't know if you're like me but I know very little about before my grandparents
very very little about it
I just the thing is I know a lot of stories but I can't remember who it was about my grandparents told us when I was growing up and even when I was an adult they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends cause they all grew up in new york city but I remember these stories but I have no idea who it was that was in those stories
so I couldn't give an accurate I couldn't tell my kids what those people were like I just remember they had some funny stories but I don't know who it was maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion and you wanted to go back some
but then usually when you find out some information from your parents then you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these
I guess I'm going to school while I'm working at t I so there's not a whole a lot of time that I've got for hobbies it seems like lately but one of the things that I do when I've got some spare time is I do some woodworking and that ranges anywhere from carpentry work to some types of furniture and knickknacks stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on and I made some candle sconces that you hang on the
I have quite a few of those that my uncle made there's something about working with wood that I enjoy that I don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but
as you know I think it's more like the mess you make isn't it? you don't have to worry about cleaning it up because it's out there I don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that but then I get the opportunity to vacuum so I guess I get some of both what are some of your things you like to do?
when I have time I do like to sew I had been doing a lot of crocheting I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them
my mother was real heavy into crafts and I would help her with whatever she happened to be doing and then she would go to these arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework
so a lot of times I'd help her with that I haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going it's a good time for gardening
it's been beautiful this last week but I could do with a little less wind but I think the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside
do you find you do most of your crocheting or your knit work around christmas time?
I usually start in the fall
and my husband says I do it make afghans so I can keep my lap warm that's kind of what my wife says she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her legs and feet with while she is working on it
I know it seems like she I think she made three this year one for my father in law and then a couple of brothers and sisters so those things they take some time to make
I found one that's real easy it's I can't even remember the name of it now but you make it in strips and it's real easy to do and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that but it's that's kind of like quilting I think mile a minute that's the name of it mile a minute
mile a minute I'm not sure what she does I first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of afghan I guess that is your standard knitting isn't it?
usually single crochet always starts it off I know
if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other don't worry about it we have a very small phone company down here and my husband says that's called rinky dink instead of call waiting or call anything else
we can't have that down here we get disconnected all the time I guess that's one way to end a conversation
it gets a little aggravating I've got kids all over the united states and sometimes they get disconnected when I'm talking to them what have you started your garden yet?
we planted potatoes and onions and bell peppers
what else did I get in there and jalapeno peppers always got to have those
I think I had four jalapeno plants last year I think one of them died but I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because there is no way that I can eat all of those nobody else in the family likes them but always got to keep those planted
my husband doesn't like them either but I can always give them away that's kind of the way I am
besides they're fun to grow I planted zucchini last year I planted four hills of them I think I had three or four seeds in each one of them and those things just flat took over it wasn't until late in the summer maybe it was because it was too dry they finally started making zucchini and I'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if they should be planted early or later it seems like all I got was
supposedly after the soil warms up I would think so seems like they all went to leaf and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit so I don't know if I mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon
but I hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is
I doubt if zucchini is in there it may not be it may not be
probably the same time the other squash is though you think they're later in the year?
about the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm that's true most of the okra that is growing around higher is later okra that's about we decided this year go ahead
I'm sorry go ahead I was just going to say it's a little over six or seven minutes so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding I'm that would be fine
just any time I guess we'll call this one quits and thanks for participating
I've enjoyed talking to you have a good time jeri?
we're supposed to discuss crime in the united states and what can be done with it
that's a rather broad topic they're usually pretty broad anyway where do you live?
we live in plano that's a
and where you are? I'm in richardson so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at maceo high school in dallas
that is so frightening it is
do you have children in school? mine are already in college now so I don't have to
at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not the rampages
I have my oldest is his first year in high school so we have all this to look forward to and it is really frightening to think that you can't even send them to school in safety certainly you can't just turn them loose in the middle of dallas but when you can't even send them on their normal activities in safety it's really frightening that's true
and I really they're coming down on the principal but I really don't know what they can do it's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs and I really don't know what can be done I just don't understand of course in my little world how guns could be so available
I don't either but apparently they just really are to me in plano you would think that would be about as innocent as you could get for being in a large area but my son comes home and tells me that he hears kids talk about having guns and someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun
and it just scared me to death and they called the police and nothing happened but it could have easily maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution
maybe so because I don't somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped and people don't do anything
a woman was raped in richardson I read in the paper about two weeks ago now and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help
but nobody did anything
I just can't imagine that they heard someone calling for help nobody even called the police to say I hear a strange screaming
I'm afraid if you I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves
I can see especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because it could be dangerous but certainly I can't understand not calling the police
I I just it's really frightening that we're trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
I think you're right there I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business but I think that's real dangerous and I don't know I try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of what's around them and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever
but the call for help is what scares me now because it just I don't know people just don't I don't know I can't say they don't care because people just have to care about another person
but it's that not getting involved that impersonal society I think we live in today
maybe this thing with the child at school maybe that will make people think a bit more and take some steps to correct it I don't know it really is frightening
I let me ask you getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing he didn't have a license for the gun?
I don't know I don't know the details this was not a child that was on the team it was someone that just kind of showed up at the field
it was a student age person but I'm not even
to begin I guess space is real important so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time I guess I agree
it's definitely new frontier stuff but I'm not too up to date on the space frontier but I guess they're going pretty far into it now star wars is not too far I don't think but
I worked on some of it at t I once upon a time have you
what do you know about it
actually I'm quite versed lately I get on a computer network all the time and people are talking about the current space program all the time they're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that are just like science fiction it's like they take off
and then they land with the the afterburners are going not like space shuttle landing gliding down but straight down to the landing pad
it's called v c x or something like that also called delta clipper which is a decent name for something like that
I don't know you think you'd go up in space if you had a chance? do you I think I would I think that'd be neat I think I would just sitting here talking about it but if the time came it'd be real nervous I'd be scared scared me worse than six flags roller coaster that'd be pretty hairy
I had a tire come off of a car so I know what it's like to imagine
depending on what was left of my technology to get me home I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now wherever and opening up those stations whatever filling them
they're talking about doing that again too
I don't know if we'll ever see that up there
at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years
and they're going to put that's all beyond my imagination really
but science fiction books you look at the jetsons cartoon show and it's not too far fetched what they all had in those cartoons so you never know
any of that stuff from the jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would become possible and we have a lot of those
so you never know what may occur but as far as me seeing it I don't know
I don't know but I think it's real vital important for the future generations to come
I it's something definitely that it's got the extra little oomph of interest
I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too once it's more possible but when they start showing the drawings and all that I'm sure when they
I wish boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it purely commercial
and they'd go up and do things and did they scratch that star wars deal they one we was all worried about russia and all that?
it's still probably going but I don't know whether research will go on but the economy the way it is all over they probably cut back on that because it's not
they're going to be cutting back so much on just the number of troops we've got in europe and the number of troops we have here I know and then
but russia's still going to have missiles they're still going to be subs and things and we don't know who's handling them now
so that's a whole different story now
latest I heard it was just going to be russia itself that was going to have them
at least that's what everybody says we want only russia to have them
and now they're saying yeah you're a republic you don't want those you don't want those some crazy hit man over there with those little republics or whatever
they splitting it all up now and one of them crazy guys get a hold of it you never know
but the guy that's taken over for gorbachev he's supposed to be on our side isn't he pretty much one hopes
I think we went through him though to get to gorbachev on a lot of subjects
but that way you can't never tell that kiss some butt but
my favorite type of music is classical music and I enjoy orchestral classical music and I enjoy classical guitar and classical piano and that's my favorite type
probably the favorite instrument would be the violin
my favorite I don't really have a favorite I like everything basically I guess if I had to pick it would be pop but I like everything so it's kind of hard to choose sometimes I guess I enjoy listening to jazz sometime although I don't feel like I have a good understanding of it or a good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not but I enjoy it and sometimes I enjoy listening to fiddle music
we were in colorado recently and we heard this fiddler and we bought his tape and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans so
I grew up next door to the richardson symphony orchestra leader so chris xeros you lucky thing
so we used to go and listen to them all the time and my parents still do
I grew up with a lot of his music and what not plus my parents are especially my dad likes a lot of classical music and he introduced my brother and I both to a lot of it so chris xeros you grew up with his children too then?
sure did small world?
we all went to high school together and we're still in contact with each other
we all go back to parents houses on the weekends and what not so actually I used to play in the richardson symphony I played violin in the orchestra for several years so
it is a small world isn't it? small world so I know chris
he's a pretty nice guy most of the time
I had to work for him and I never would want to work for him so life just took different turns here so it just didn't work out to do that now so he's about ready to retire another year and he
he sure is he just became a grandfather I heard that it's his daughter that
they just had the baby's christening so it was really nice so was it a boy or a girl?
he's a little boy what did they name him?
I can't it's a it's elijah or something like that
I keep forgetting what she named him
his middle name is chris or christopher for her daddy of course
but I think it's elijah it starts with an e
I can't remember so you've heard the richardson symphony?
we've heard them and liked it real well of course do you have a favorite instrument?
actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord
I really like those in fact I had a harpsichord played at my wedding did you?
which was real nice I got married during the christmas season and we played old fashioned christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not and it was real nice I liked that a lot I liked the sound of the harpsichord and it played by itself?
somebody played it but you didn't have oboe or something with it?
just by itself just by itself
it was real nice I bet that was nice
it went well it was a change from your traditional normal stuff since it was christmas time and we had the church decorated with christmas hollies and poinsettias and stuff like that and so we did the harpsichord with old time traditional christmas carols
not the bouncy sing along kind but some of the older ones that
some I recognize the melodies and whatnot but I didn't recognize the name
it was real nice actually I play the violin in a string quartet that often plays at weddings
so I always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano
and it makes it nice it makes you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else it does
it really does and it has such a different sound to it anyway it's almost I don't know the way it vibrates it's kind of haunting on some of the notes it's I like it
I don't know how else to explain but we've got friends that are in the music business that go around dallas they're called odessa it's a husband and wife team that we've known for years and we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff too so we've had a lot of stuff friends and things to do with music that constant plus my husband's real big into music too so he doesn't play anything but he just likes to listen
and my dad and my kids are now my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and does the school in your city does it offer band or some of the instruments?
my oldest is only nine
so he hasn't really gotten into that yet they have choir that they go to music class that they go to
but he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet
I think that starts in sixth grade probably
but I don't know the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause my brother plays and I don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something
you got a little ways to go too
just a little bit my oldest is eight and we've started her on piano so
but it's been fun it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared but it's been fun it's been fun I feel like I've learned a lot about the piano I've learned a lot about playing the piano
and it kind of makes me listen a little closer to the piano when I hear it at other places or when I see and hear someone playing I sort of watch their technique too and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning so it's been fun I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or
this is donna donahue
ready to get started? I think so
sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here what did you have for lunch?
it was I'm an officer in the air force
and we went to the officers club for a little mexican food today that's interesting
so our topic is food today is that
if you're having a dinner party what would you serve? do you want me to go first?
if I was having a dinner party I would probably have some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some salsa and chips around and peanuts and then I usually have a little theme when I have a dinner party so I would have maybe if it was greek night or something maybe on the barbecue we'd put cubes of lamb or lamb used for greek a shish kabob and mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
and then we'd have a big greek tossed salad kind of like a caesar salad
and let's see what else maybe some rolls and some rice or something like that how does that sound?
when is the party here? that would take some planning but
I don't know being the bachelor here that I am I don't think I'd it's not a question of capability here to do something like that it's just there's no motivation that's right
I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that but that sounds good too I have three kids
so when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby sit for the little two younger ones upstairs and usually we just have very plain kind of not very interesting meals pizza and that all
so once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun but it's not a regular thing
are we supposed to talk for about five minutes is that it?
that's what they are shooting for here
let's see you would have a barbecue
I live on a lake here
so it and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors
that's a little more a casual thing but in the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a fireplace and a nice nice house and all that so we sort of a really good place to do entertaining like that
that sounds wonderful
I just haven't really tried a whole lot but I don't know
let's see one time I did have a dinner party I served a I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits and kind of southern food even though I'm up here in new york
so you are in new york right now?
I'm in texas I didn't know this was from all over the whole country I see it is it's and I'm originally from long island
no kidding? and now where are you in new york? upstate upstate
rome in griffins air force base
is that where you are originally from around there?
I was born in buffalo
and been all over the place that's interesting let's see sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have everybody bring something
and that's real interesting because then you get different kinds of foods and new recipes and sometimes somebody will bring something that you really like
and get the recipe from them or whatever and we are just getting interested in mexican food because here in texas they have lots of really good mexican restaurants
and we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could
do you know what a fajita is?
I've been down to texas a few times and had the pleasure of their good mexican cuisine down there
they have some delicious delicious things and I since I always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts
and you boil them maybe four chicken breasts and you boil them until they are cooked maybe thirty minutes
and then you debone them and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled and you take little bit maybe two tablespoons of butter in a big frying pan and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt you think about aids research?
aids is a nasty terrible disease and you die from it so I think that they need to look into it and it's kind of like cancer I don't how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer
I think it'll probably be as difficult how about yourself I'm certainly in favor of aids research and I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does I think that because besides the fact that it's a deadly disease that it's a contagious disease so that it's although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem
they say a million people are infected with the h I v virus
and I think that's in the world or in america? you
in the country america that's and they have millions whose figure is that?
I don't know I've just heard it on the radio
sometimes you hear things on the radio that could be true or couldn't be
do you feel like this is I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this aids research
do you think they should spend more? I think they should actually although and I don't necessarily think that they should fund aids research and in the process neglect cancer research or whatever I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general
what do you think doug of mister johnson? I am sorry that he has the virus
magic? I don't know I think it's very strange that the media hasn't questioned him more strongly about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that as they probably would for a lot of other people
do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of the media? not really though I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position but I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing it's what many people have done already who were just less famous
I took advantage of the opportunity when he came out I talked to my kids about it
it's something that I hadn't done before that's good
I'm glad that mister johnson's changed his tune on safe sex to abstinence or I was glad he did that for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting
let's see what are some of the other questions you don't let's see I don't have any friends that have the disease I guess you might not I do my cousin does for instance
is it pretty nasty? and
it is he's actually he had aids related complex for a while and he is now in full blown aids really not doing very well and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing
it sounds awful it's a very nasty thing
is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly and that's basically it that the immune system can at first slow down and the white blood cell count goes down that's aids related complex but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom that's aids
and and in that case people are prone to getting any kind of weird cancer that only animals got before
and that sort of thing
jack what type of music do you like?
I like classical and sort of popular rock type music
I enjoy classical too I never really had listened to it till I got married
and my wife enjoys it
so I had never listened to it till then but now I listen to it whenever she does and even every once in a while I put it on myself
I used to play the piano and I like bach and sort of the baroque music handel and vivaldi and those kinds of
those are really nice I like those
though I couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says this is bach
I don't know all that much myself I just know when I hear it that I like it
that you what you like how about popular music?
whatsever's on the radio is usually okay with me but sometimes I have a hard time hearing the words clearly if I'm in the car and there's noise and stuff so
it's mostly just the tunes I'm pretty much the same way people always say the meanings of those words
I know and I'm always meaning? there's
I just thought they just all sort of rhymed
I know I know about the only thing I can remember after the song is over is the refrain that whenever they say it two or three times
I'm the same way it's funny depending on where you live I commute back and forth between baltimore and a rural town called salisbury which is two and a half hours away
and the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different when
because baltimore will play more what might be considered a little bit more progressive?
and as soon as you go down to salisbury this town that's two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever in real rural maryland it turns into basically classic rock and they don't
oldies or what? mostly oldies
but classic rock with when the doors movie came out doors was really on the radio there where you'd hear one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in baltimore
but in salisbury that's all you would hear was this is the doors
so it was sort of a funny thing
there's a big variation among the country if you go down south country music and
that's I'm starting to realize that I never really thought about that much but there is I didn't
I lived in pittsburgh before baltimore and I never really noticed the difference when I moved to this area?
I really didn't notice at all it just seemed the same
but when I went more rural it really changed
chicago has a lot of good stations does it?
in fact they have a continuous news station which is nice if you're driving and you want to
you don't have to wait till the hour mark it's sort of constant you just turn there
and you get the latest news and everything it's sort of like c n n you turn on your t v and it's on that would really be beneficial
so because you never hear the news basically on the radio I never get it
and if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in the car all the time that's pretty good
so I like to listen to tapes of music or stuff on a long trip
and now you can even get books on tape on fact my grandmother does that a lot because she's blind
or she's losing her sight or whatever
but that in I can imagine if you're driving cross country listening to a story
lot of the classics are really on tape
so that's a lot of fun but that would be good
we strayed a lot from music
I guess so but I guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening so as long you're listening so
but if you do have to go something I guess we can just cut off
jack it was nice to talk to you
nice talking to you tom and good luck and I hope you get some more calls and make some more calls thank you what kind of a car do you drive now? I drive a honda prelude do you? I drive a honda accord
I bought mine a year ago so I'm not buying a car any time soon me either I just bought mine it will be a year in august
I love it though I love hondas
it I think I found my car
I like where all the controls are they're in good spots
and I have an automatic I can't drive a standard I have a standard
but I an it's supposedly real reliable the only thing I've ever heard about hondas is that the breaks go out first I hadn't heard that
what did you have before you bought that I had a buick regal did you?
I had a mazda r x seven before that and that was the worse car I've ever driven in my life
the buick was great it was nine years old and it was still going strong
the only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old
and that was the only major problem that I had I had little piddly things like I had to replace the muffler
and I had replaced the tires and seems like it had a radiator leak once but I never had any major anything other than the compressor
I really never had anything major with my mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end I had it five years and the last two years it seemed to go out really easily I think it went out twice in two years and that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much
and so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the honda but I don't think I'm going to do that again I think I'm going back to automatic now
I never I kind of know how to drive standard but I've never owned one so I don't drive one a lot
I don't feel comfortable in traffic with it
and for everything I've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic it is
and resale value is really important to me that's true
it is me too that's why I got the honda
hondas have great resale value
the mazda definitely did not not at all they're worse than american cars or just as bad as far as resale goes
I did pretty well with my regal because it was in really good shape but it still looked real nice
the interior was still really nice there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff
and it had some nice features so I ended up okay with the buick
and I anticipate the same thing with the honda whenever I decide to sell it of course I may never sell it
I may drive it until it's dead but that's what I did with the mazda drive it until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off
so probably what I'll do again
but I really like the hondas I like foreign cars a lot
I looked at the mitsubishi galant I was looking for a four door car having driven the r x seven so long
and it was so small and it's really impractical so I wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of and I looked at the galant and those were really nice and I can get them for a great price
but I found it hard to deal with the dealership I was going through
that's how I ended up with a honda
I wasn't even looking for a car when I bought this car I was thinking about buying a prelude from a friend who was moving to new york or something and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore and it was only a year old and I had never driven a prelude so I went to a dealership because they had the same year and same model of prelude on their used car lot
and I went and I test drove it and I just fell in love with this brand new white prelude two liter s I with the sun roof and the moon roof they're nice I think
and I bought it loaded
I have to have them loaded
I love all those little things that you don't need but they're so wonderful
I went there looking at a used car and two days later I bought this car
I felt like that was largest impulse that I had ever made
the two other things that I bought on impulse are a v c r and a washer and dryer I understand
I go for the big stuff I noticed mine was definitely not impulse I really needed a new car mine was just it was getting worn out from being a sports car I drove it kind of hard
and I got it right after high school so by the time I traded it in it was ready
I got my buick as a high school graduation gift ready to go did you?
but I guess this wasn't really an impulse buying it right then and right quickly was kind of impulsive but I'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years and I was just scared to
I was scared to start taking on payments because the buick was long since paid for that's the same with me would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself? buy a used car?
I was going to buy one once but I worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that
just I can't seem to get over that that just bothers me I don't know why
on hondas they supposedly the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff that's true
they can't stop you from doing it hoping that they do go to a honda dealership to get them serviced
and even if they didn't you can still get a good idea if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the block and everything that's true I guess that's all
I enjoyed talking to you I enjoyed talking to you
I am the product of as much the changing roles of women as anyone my mother we come from a my mother and I were really first generation divorce in our family
my mother was divorced in nineteen fifty seven when I was seven years old
and I was the first one of anyone that anyone had ever known to have a divorce
of course now fifty percent divorces in the united states my mother was treated very badly by a lot of family members especially from my father's side of the family and also we were ostracized by his family basically we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth
and they all felt that there was never an issue that my father was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce
it was always my mother's fault she was not sufficient she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude that's too bad
so it was too bad it was really rough that's sad it really is
so that's so changing some of the changing roles of women in that respect I have been a product of
I think that there are people that I was first generation going to college in my family
first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career in a secretarial position she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession in des moines iowa that's wonderful
she was a secretary to a federal judge
and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him so that was a really high status position that's wonderful she made over thirty thousand a year that speaks well of your mother
she a real hard she had high standards
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back bless her heart
so I went to college and now since have completed two master's degrees and I am the director of music in a church but interestingly enough I am still everyday confronted with challenges
challenges that have to do with my sex
for instance I am just not taken as seriously at professions as many of the men who are doing the same job I do
and the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman they expect me to be more motherly they question my authority more than they ever would a man and I have experience with this because I work both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man
so I am pretty aware of what goes on in the church
so basically that's I am done talking do you want to talk? I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well nickie and I can relate to that
I think it's the image that the woman has in the world as the lesser of the two
always and I think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to take
and I think we are progressing at a snail's pace
but we are progressing
so that's the main point is that we are going ahead
and I think that in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve
and men a lot of them have come around and have seen the error of their ways
but there are a lot of die hards out there that will never change
so we have to face that reality also
I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend why they can not just accept competent women I have never been able to understand that I guess it's fear what it could be if they are not sure of themselves
the ones that go along with that they are sure of themselves
and they know that they can be on the same level
and they do not have any ego problems that they are fighting
and I think that we are going to be on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term
and what I would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that we each have our jobs in life and that we should recognize that and that we should support each other
and I think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal
men have a lot of trouble with that though
in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower it seems that they are more comfortable that way and I do not know if it's a militaristic point of view somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but it's just really interesting to me I am married to a wonderful man who treats me with as
I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues it's never over it's always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and I am the slave
and it those are the only issues we ever fight about I think it's just difficult for men to accept women equally even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss dictatorships are real efficient I guess we would have to go back to the way that the lord made us
and the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands
and I believe that strongly
but I think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is
and I think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict
and I think that can happen in a very wonderful way
and if we men and women would do as the bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves
can you picture that?
if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself
it's true and that's really the divine answer and the right answer
so that would be a beautiful relationship
it would be and I think there are some people that have done that and I have seen it
and it's just marvelous and I am just in awe to see this do you own a p c?
I don't I have one at the company I work for furnishes so I can work at home
and it's just an old compact that is super slow but it does its job so what processor does it have in it?
I don't know it's so old it's one of what kind of work do you do on it?
I do television ratings and I process some ratings and do graphics for their television stations their clients so
it's basically just data entry and running some software so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated I don't own a p c but I work for t I and
my husband does too so I have a fairly fancy one it's a t I model it's an s p one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty six
and I the job that I do I do a lot of training of our customers for new products
and I have to develop functional specs and desk top publishing and everything so it's kind of fun
I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house but I just haven't got around to doing it yet
I'd like to have one for the house too but sometimes my husband says usually I work on the computer all day at work I don't want to come home and have to work on one too your husband what group is your husband in?
something with the defense
defense systems and electronics group?
something like that they've changed their name so many times I've lost track so I see
he works up in plano
I work on printers and the peripheral products division basically
I work in the airline marketing group so we do a lot of
I didn't even know they had anything like that
there's so they're I learned so many things that they do they're into so many different things so
I just kind of in for a while he had one of those top secret things where he couldn't talk about what he did so for a while
but then he switched jobs I don't understand half the stuff he does and I have is he a programmer? I see
software design engineer as they call it so but I have a degree in information management which is computer
it's basically more the business end of it than the programming end of it
but I've been at it for five years so everything's changed so much I probably couldn't even get a job right now it seems like it's changed so much so they've made such advances in computers so so does your husband ever use a laptop or a notebook? does he bring a little one home with him or
sometimes he brought home a portable one
but it quit working so he brought it back and he just hasn't brought another one home but they did give him a new computer at work so I see we build laptop and notebook computers here in temple also
and those are really handy they have modems in them you can send a fax from your p c
how nice but they're really
he doesn't have one of those so what's that?
he doesn't have one of those they're pretty handy because when I travel it's easy to check messages just plug in the phone to your computer and dial in and
my husband doesn't have to travel so I just found out I'm going to denver sunday night again
at least you get to so that kind of reeks havoc with plans
but it's really not enough to become a big hassle
that's good some people enjoy the travel but I don't think I'd like it if he traveled a lot I see
I would love to have a computer they but they're so expensive I don't know there you can get depends on what you consider expensive
you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars where just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars
I guess it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be but it's a lot to put into one it's still two thousand dollars isn't just pocket change to a lot of people
that's right it's not it's not pocket change so it's major maybe when the kids get in school that will be when they start needing something then that will be different but when I started at t I I was a summer development student and finishing up at school
and so those papers really it was nice having access to the equipment to
I remember that I had to do some of my husband's papers because I had access to one but his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing so
I did a lot of his papers they come in real handy that was a lifesaver how many different types of packages do you use? at home?
all I the packages I don't really use what I use that outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that I use I've got up at work anyway I use wordperfect and lotus and which is a line draw package I know those two
I've just used wordperfect and lotus the most you probably use or something like that for your data entry stuff that you're talking about
a lot of the data entry stuff they used uh survey system and just in house programs to do what they needed I work do you work at home all the time or just
I worked for this company before I had my first daughter
and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things so that worked out pretty good then
it did I really don't do a lot of what I used to do I just do something really minor but it's something that nobody else wants to do
and it's time consuming so so it keeps you in the company?
that's right it gives me a paycheck the work goes for three to four weeks three times a year
it's not something that's continual because the television ratings don't come out all the time they only come out four times a year but I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here I'd get all kinds of stuff done
phone's always ringing and people always asking me to do something else
I've got a lot of especially right now we've got several new products coming out and I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise
will they let you take a computer home to work? but I need to be at the office too
I've just got to deal with all those other things that happen but a p c at the house would really take a lot of the load off
I bet my he took one home when they had a big deadline coming up and it was looking a little touchy to meet so I've done that before a couple times
but that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks
that's right I thought that would be because it's real nice with this because I don't even have to go into the office I've maybe been into the office once in the past three years
they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever so that sounds really nice
it is real nice I just deal with them on the telephone half the people don't even know who they're talking to
but I worked I know most of them I can't say that a lot of people changed around there but most people know who I am but I don't know who they are
a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as well
you just know them by the telephone but it's been good talking to you I think we've got the subject we sort of stayed to the topic anyway
we tried it's hard to sometimes we'll talk to you later
the topic was should the united states adopt the metric system and if so should how should they do it? why didn't it work last time? and why didn't it work last time?
I'm all for it I am too I wish it had started a long time ago is the problem because we're so wound up in the system that we've got that trying to convert over
and I guess they tried soft conversion and hard conversion
they tried the one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter
direct conversion I don't know
I think they just ought to just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and people if they have to are going to learn to think that way doesn't just about everything now have both metric and english
they do but things are generally packaged in the english sized packages you buy a quart of milk and it has the metric equivalent written on there but it still a quart
but if they started putting it in liters of oil and liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric as long as you can still buy a product in the english units that's how you're going to think of it I kind of remember back when gas prices started up pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range somebody had I believe it was exxon
it figures we were living in lubbock at the time they started marketing it in liters and it was only twenty nine and thirty cents a liter so they could put this sign out front that said thirty nine cents a liter
and nobody had any idea what a liter was so
that's the problem when we finally out that liters was about a quart there's about four liters in a gallon so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it
it's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age I don't know when I was growing up we were talking metric system in school not at first
but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade anyway
I would expect people with any kind of buying power under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is a liter's about a quart I think maybe there's where the problem came in we've tried to instead of learning it's kind of like learning a language when you learn one from the other you always end up in this conversion thing all the time
so you it's almost like course this country isn't a dictatorship but it's like somebody said as of such and such a date anybody caught talking in the english will be shot or something like that but
thing is it's a global market place these days and we're one of two backwards countries in the world as far as I read that uganda and something I don't remember what the other one is but there's one or two others that just
it's just time for us to go over because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international
I don't I work for t I we're all around the world you have to perform this conversion anyway I do too
and and one of the things that we've run into a problem course you're familiar with the t I drawing with any drawing system you end up with things in parts of inches half fourth this sort of thing mils and microns
and then you end up with a decimal where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing
and then some of them are done in purely metric
I remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns and ours were in mils
and it got to somewhere down the line they went standardized they went microns but you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs I can imagine
the one that have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
I was with t I in el salvador for a while and I had to get used to purely metric system down there because they didn't understand anything else if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what
so I had a little bit of experience with it and also I noticed in canada you drop a quarter fifty cents whatever in a coke machine up there and you get this funny looking coke it's in a can that's taller but not as big around I guess that's some
about half a liter it's not a liter it's a half a liter or something like that it's a strange looking can but my daughter in law's from panama and they have had americans down there for so long that they're kind of into both systems but she gets real confused on distances and temperature is the big thing the centigrade for which she says celsius
I would have more problem with the temperature except that working in engineering we do everything in centigrade or celsius
I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature if it's between zero and ten it's cold and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm
it's getting warm if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out but the big problem is not having the resolution between a hundred or what thirty zero thirty four degrees whatever that is you don't get all the little differences
it's about the differences between seventy and seventy two or seventy five degrees isn't much but the difference thirty and thirty five degrees is quite a bit
is about twice as much what it works out to five
one point eight times as many points something like that
so I think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the american way
and until we have to learn to think that way we won't though we call it the english system but I'm not sure what they do in england now they're on metric aren't they?
for the most part I think so except they've got a we run into some problems once I remember they've got a nut and bolts system called wentworth and this thing was even different than s a e standards and stuff so
this my dad bought one of these little nash metropolitans here quite a few years back and the thing had a austin heeley type engine it was austin motors engine and running gear
and the body was built by nash or that was even before american motors but nash essentially in the u s somewhere and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and wentworth and s a e he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing
he just get one more because I think the wentworth and the s a e bolt sizes were the same but the threads were different and it was a total mess
that would be a mess and on my chevy van that's a couple of years old part of it's built in canada matter of fact the thing is I always say it's built off shore because it was assembled in canada the only thing that was in it built in the u s was the differential and it was built in buffalo new york but it's got the hardest combination of metric and most of the body parts seem to be metric and most of the engine parts seem to be s a e so it's just crazy
it just gets bad you got to have one and not mix them up
because you're never going to get to one system if you still got a mix and of course here that would involve changing road signs all across the country miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole nine yards kind of hard to do gradually I thought maybe they would convert to metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because fifty six or fifty seven's a hundred kilometers and you know
you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour you'd have hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five you'd have people going a hundred miles an hour
and so I don't know I'd kind of and the other thing too is between here and el paso's five hundred miles but it's almost eight hundred kilometers that'd sure seems like a long way
but they'd seem to be ticking off faster too I guess that's it
every road sign you come to is I don't know it that far they converted all the road signs to fifty five miles an hour they could've converted it to metric just about as easy
I think they you got the problem with all your cars are still you still got cars on the road that don't have both
at that time that was still when things were the metric system was still not not all that common
now cars they have both sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way I know the only other place that I was ever at where they really had it mixed was in panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in miles per hour and some are in kilometers and you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process
not so much personally but my husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother always lived in the same town and took care of him and such they live down in college station where his parents do too
and they put her in a home last year
she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to not be able to be in her apartment on her own
so they found a place nearby that they put her in last year it was pretty much a physical decision?
although she is in pretty good health and doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point
then she was starting to lose memory sometimes which is kind of frightening when she's in the car
my husband's family are reaching that point but it's so difficult was she in favor of it or was she kind of opposed to it?
when it finally came down to it she just got to the point after the it wasn't a very strong stroke it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself
and she didn't eat she ate very poor so I think she was bad nutrition on top of it and she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so so often I think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad I work with a lot of elderly people I'm a trust officer
and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals
she was almost ridiculous she'd eat ice cream and cookies she'd that's part of the aging process that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste didn't one it really is
she didn't want to cook for herself anymore
that's too much trouble that's too much trouble didn't want to cook and the portions people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals I do that right now
and I'm not near nursing home age
although they've got meals on wheels which I understand is a really good way to handle that so that at least they eat
so as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice
I don't think there was I know a little bit more from a co worker her mother in law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in
she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care then she got uh hip broken and then she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost to the point of saying she can't be here anymore
but I remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the arkansas house out in arlington something like that
and you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share a bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items that's a given
they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them unconsciously do it as a just half
and sometimes the help there does it I think
so they don't have too many facilities for their personal items very limited space waste
but at least they all seem to have people that monitor their medication intake and dining facilities go to the dining room and eat some good meals
I know when my friend's mother in law first went in very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say I'll be with other people but adapt
I don't understand that they don't want to be with anybody else
as I think I mentioned I was in the trust business and I've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but the places like presbyterian village and some of the retirement places where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting
they're able to move in while they're still independent and still social
and they do group things and then if health or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in it's really kind of difficult
I have a my aunt's mother is gotten ill recently and she lives in pennsylvania they live in alabama and they're saying we need you to be closer and you have women like that
I don't to men it seems like the women just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that whole
they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and I don't want to leave it and it's the first step in actually accepting that you are failing and aging
once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change
they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly make the decision and that scares me the thought of forcing somebody to do something
but it's so lonely they can't get out and see anyone and it's hard for someone like me to understand that
because I think what do you have there? it's a house it's walls and it's furniture but there's nobody there not as independence
don't you want to be close to me? be with other people
I just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building
and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house and the quality of life really isn't there
it's tough it really is
that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family
what does that house got attraction? they fear being dependent on somebody
I know they're really proud of independence they fear being a burden to family members
my husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation
she'll let something slip and we'll say wait a minute and that's it she just I didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers
when she got home who took care of her? she stayed in a temporary nursing home until she was okay
it's just but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her she's down in temple
and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on
so it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and
my husband and I we have been thinking about his folks are in college station
and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the dallas area and there's nothing to hold them there in college station since they're retired
so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here
discussion on child care
do you have any children? they're all grown up
I work in a day care center and you know all about it then
I enjoy it a lot it's been quite a few years I have grandchildren but haven't really been into selecting child care for them so
and it's been quite a few years since I've had to think about that
do they go to a day care center or do they stay at my daughter that has three stays home with her children
that's nice and one of my daughters has one but an aunt keeps the baby
that's nice but I would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays but I would imagine it's very hard
I think so I think it's hard to find a good day care I have worked at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion
but this one that I'm in now is very good and one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children
and in pennsylvania for babies there has to be a one to four ratio at the most no more than four babies per care giver
but we keep it down to two to one that's good
that makes it a little easier to deal with I've always thought it would be really tough what if you had a fire or something with babies?
I know we you would have to be able to have enough you'd have to be able to get them all out
what we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are low to the ground
and they're reenforced real strong and they'll sit four babies we would just lie them in there and they roll real well and maneuver that's a
that will get them out I hadn't thought about that but I was thinking if they had very many babies they couldn't possibly get them all out
but you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out I guess that's neat
that's certainly something we hope never happens do most of your day care workers really care about the children or is it just a job for them?
most really care in this center really care most everyone has a college degree in early childhood education
and really there's only like eight children per room and then there's mostly three care givers in each room
and that enables them to spend more time with the children sometimes I feel like all I'm doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap so it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them
it's easy to get attached to them too how old are the children go with this center where you work?
in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months
and throughout the center it goes up to age twelve
I have the real real young ones in my room you've got the little bitty ones
those are probably the best group to have
they're wonderful they don't complain too much and they're fun
they are a lot of fun babies are fun and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet so
not quite it's a when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things and
you have to be real careful everything is baby proof all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything but they try do you think there's very many really good day care centers around your area? but
in my area because I live in a college town in penn state university
so I there is a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on
and in general though I've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers I've worked at and all
it's not my choice for when I have children but some people don't have a choice sometimes it's a have to
I hear a lot of the girls I work with constantly I wish I could find someplace I really felt good about you know?
most of them don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids
that is sad and it's really bad one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place and then they called her one afternoon and said we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today and we just now found her what? they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
and so immediately she says I can't have any confidence in them anymore if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they're one short
but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus
and this was four hours later
that poor child so what do you do?
that's awful so she has switched to a different center now and I
do you keep a family budget or do you have some
I don't use a family budget my father who is very old has kept one his entire life and I probably rebelled against it
I probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage interesting
we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school when we were first married and I sort of just got in the habit and never have gotten out of it I can not really say that it's a formal budget it's more just a fairly accurate recording of what I spend and what I think I am going to have to spend and
I think it makes much more sense
and I have recently gotten out of debt and everything and I will probably start keeping a little better track of it
I just spent whatever came in and never knew what came in and what went out about like the government runs
that sounds real similar
so I think it is probably better to have at least a record but my dad was so precise that if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent
and that was put over there
and of course he is from the depression so it's his life
but I think it would be smart if somebody would keep some sort of a plan that works for them I think you are right it must have been sort of interesting to us it's because since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years I can go back and look and it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years it is for instance
I'm a historian and my father had kept them since nineteen twenty seven but he burned the ones from twenty seven to
I could not believe he did that so I took the ones from fifty two on to the present
but to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that
but as a matter of fact my mother was going through some things not long ago and she came upon a budget book that she had back in the thirties when they
it was the late I guess it must have been in the forties because they had been married probably fifteen years at the time and it was just fascinating to see how little things cost it was just almost laughable in some instances that
of course it's all relative of course
I know but never the less it was fun to see those figures next to for a pair of shoes was like five dollars and
I know even in nineteen sixty three I found a record that I had what I had paid for hotels
and a similar hotel in paris is two hundred dollars a night now
and I paid between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty isn't that something
and that's really crazy cause that's about thirty years ago that is really something
but of course it's just what the market will bear that's true
if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten
that's right that's just good old economics working
we have tried to instill some sense of budgeting in our kids but our two children are just as unlike as night and day and our son could care less about a budget
and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost just sounds like your father
she has everything planned so closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop
then you never know how they will one they may flip flop when they get to be older
the other one may be very careful
and she may marry somebody and of course it would be good because it you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching
you should have one in the house I think that is true I and I think that is probably what happened in our house
and I think because I think my husband was not quite as good at saving and so on before we got married and I was really diligent about that I was putting money aside before I was married when I was working out of college and that really paid off
because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts and
that's about the way it is here if it had not been for my wife I would have probably been in debtor's prison if we had one
but what does you husband do now? he is an engineer he is an electrical engineer and in fact went through many years of graduate school and got his p h d
so we had a lot of years of budgeting
you have to do it when you are in school and when you
my wife is still in school getting her doctorate
and it I'm working on my master's degree now and I have got so in fact this last year we had three both of the children were in college our son has a year left and our daughter graduated this year and I'm just about ready to finish my master's degree
so we have had once again a real lean year for us
I know we had three in college plus my wife but so that was four
so we were both in the same you know exactly what it's like then
and it's which you learn I guess you figure that that is an investment that is really invaluable
that is the best one
with education you can't take that away from you
that is right it's one that you can live through and I think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel that it was worth it to save and to not have something and in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
so it really makes it easier
that's true but I have enjoyed talking with you jerry
I have enjoyed talking with you kathy and I wish I could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me I am interested in that
if I had your address I would send you I am also in the travel business I do tours
and I can take some real great tours to europe so if you my husband and I just went there last year
actually we did not take a tour we were in england and went to ireland and scotland and just rented cars and did it on our own
but I that sounds interesting is your business in dallas then? it's here in dallas
in the quorum I'm jerry hammond and I'm out at brookhaven college so you could just holler at me there you are kidding
I'm going to be teaching at brookhaven in the fall
what is your last name? kuenzer k u e n z e r and I'm
k u e n z e r and I will be in the communications department teaching english one oh one to
good I will I have a couple of sections
I know zack miller real well that's the guy who hired me
wonderful I will look you up in the fall then fantastic
it's been a good type conversation
I started when I was in college they always offer credit cards for college students
so I went ahead and accepted every one that I was offered because I knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early
so I pack around a lot of them but I only use a few of them
you have a lot of discipline they make it really easy for people to get credit cards especially college students
I have two daughters who both are in college or in fact one has finished now but they both have a lot of credit cards and they give you such high credit limits
it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap
and then they give you the credit limit and then you're always seemingly up to that limit I have quite a few credit cards that I'm always almost up to the limit on most of them and that's how a lot of people get into trouble I've got two that usually I'll have a balance on
and then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an american express card and pay it off every month
and that way I feel like I'm getting a thirty day loan
but I don't have to worry about running them up too high except at christmas then they usually get run up pretty good
you have a lot of discipline I'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine I've paid off about four credit cards this year
but still I have some that are up to the limit and especially the visa card that you can go and get cash on
and it seems like every time I'm short of cash I just go get it from visa that's I've never used my visa for cash before
can you use it at a bank machine or
you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card and say I want a cash advance or if they've sent you a number that you can use a personal identification number that you can use in the impact machines or whatever you can do that
because I have one that I don't have a pin number for sometimes you have to ask them for that
and then I have one that just gave me the pin number automatically we got that's funny you said that because my husband and I got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for
a couple of weeks later we got pin numbers and then we got a bill saying the yearly fee it was forty dollars
and we cut them up and sent them back because we hadn't even applied for them and we didn't want them but they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us
so I thought I don't know if I trust this or not
they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time everybody in the world will offer you a credit card it's let's see if we can get her to run up her bills
but it's hard it's tempting when you see something to say I'll just charge it and sometimes I'll do that but usually I will try to pay everything off the next month or the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time I'll pay more than the minimum payment
just I feel like even that little bit helps
the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that I think we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible that's why I've really started to try to pay off mine and get out of debt because we never know when we might get laid off or something I know it
especially me I work for texas instruments and they've had a lot of layoffs lately I work for t I too
you do? and I think they're getting ready to probably sell us out our division where are you? in johnson city tennessee
johnson city I know they're selling out somebody in colorado springs
they just announced that didn't they?
so it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards
it certainly is I have worked on a part time job where I was a collector for a jewelry company
people that they just had this jewelry account it was zales jewelry in fact and a whole bunch of they have about a thousand collectors I guess
and there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item
and then they just can't pay for it something happens and you hear so many stories listening to them like they lost their job or they've signed for a friend they got it in their name but they got it for a friend and then the friend wouldn't pay them didn't pay them
and now they're stuck with the bill and it's ruining their credit and you really have to watch this because that's scary
because every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau automatically most of them do I didn't realize that
and if you're it's bad because if your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month
but if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late you're thirty days late they don't recognize any time difference do they? that's scary
and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of that's something I never thought about checking with to see what your credit report looked like
you can do that I believe it costs about ten dollars might be worth it for peace of mind
it is it is you might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you didn't even know it you might think you're paying something on time and you by that day and you're thirty days is not real bad though anyway if you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that
that's when it really gets bad or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days and things like that I think that discover card has a good idea with giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back
and since they don't have the yearly fee do they charge a lot of interest on that card? I don't know
I don't I haven't gotten one just because it's
I felt like with visa and mastercard and american express you didn't need another one
I would think it wouldn't be much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges
so that wouldn't be too bad
always watch out for anybody who bills you out of atlanta georgia or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us twenty one and twenty two percent interest I know I had a charge with spiegel and I hadn't read the terms of the credit agreement really
and when I did I realized that it just seemed like I was never paying the balance off
and I looked at the credit card agreement one day and it was twenty three percent interest
and that's the one bill that I hurried and paid up
and I've always watched it since then that's awful
you really have to watch those interest rates I mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to that's true
so they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent in texas but there are a couple of states that can that's great
and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of atlanta georgia I'll try to remember that one
let's see I was trying to think if there was anything else
I guess the worst problem I ever had with a credit card though was I got an item on my bill that I had never purchased
I had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it
and I changed my mind
but then they went ahead and charged it on my account
and it took me about eighteen months to get all of that mess off of my account
so that's probably the worst thing I've ever had happen with a credit card I wonder if they
wayne I feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available how do you feel about it?
I feel much the same way I've two kids right now
one is two and a half and one's nine months and that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do and so it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn that they need to learn at the age reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing
we went through this with our children and now with our grandchildren and I've always tried to do things with them like when you're at the little league helping out even though I'm not a good athlete myself I was able to help the coach in just controlling the kids if nothing else and we've always tried to take our children and our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to I think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things
and so it's we have lived several places around the u s and where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area when we lived in tennessee we took them to washington d c to see all the capitol and things like that when they were small and it's helps the children when they're learning in school to say I've been there and I've seen that that's the type
it certainly does because the things in the books seem so dead to the kids unless they've actually been there or whatever because I remember our family we went everywhere and seeing new england and being on plymouth rock and stuff like that really made the whole thing more visual
and we could read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon
we've gone through that I remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so I made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren I feel it's a very important thing to be done
because if kids don't look up to you or can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else
and nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid emulating or whatever I can remember one of the things I'm most proud of is when my son was I think it was in the sixth grade they had to write a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do and I was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him a real point of pride with me
that is nice it sounds like we both have colds
it's ten o'clock here in falls church virginia
so that the only reason I'm home is because I'm home with a cold we're
and the wife says you need something to do talk to a guy on the phone I'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of dallas texas
we're kind of far apart here
this is a very interesting program I heard about here on this and when I signed up for it it looked like it could make a real contribution in participating
I'm an electrical engineer by trade here in virginia
likewise we do some projects every now and then we like to get support from other companies as well I'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan
trying to work myself out of a job
but it's been an interesting roughly nine months here and again this is our home area
we've lived here about seventeen years and it's we enjoy living here it's where we originally started out and we've lived up north for a while in chicago and over in tennessee so wound up back about two hundred miles away from where we started out
that's about all I can think to talk about right now it's been a pleasure talking with you thank you
do you have an opinion on credit cards? I do you do?
what do you think about them? I think they get a lot of people in trouble
I have one right now and I just got it about six months ago
and I find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get and then you don't stop to realize that you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you don't stop to think about it
I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years ago ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble
so I eventually got it all paid now I carry one I have a gas card and a visa card and I never use them unless I need to but they that's good
I made a rule with myself when I got one that if I couldn't pay it in full every month that I'd have to rip it up so that's a good idea stops all them interest rates that's and interest rates aren't none too shallow these days anyway
but but I know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially we have I'm in lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to tech and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot
I have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out and they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off
and one of my friends hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she only earns two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school
and so that's just enough to pay rent and buy thirty five dollars worth of food a month and pay for her monthly fee I guess you have to pay twenty dollars each month is the something like that
so all she's paying is interest on hers every month
it just seems crazy to me but my wife got in trouble one time with hers she was making forty five dollars a month I think and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month
and that was before we got married so
but it's we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it's come out pretty good now we have a eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college
that's the first thing he wanted was a visa card?
so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick I bet so
I don't know I'm about sick of mine right now I don't but I think they're too readily accessible
and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you trapped you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards we just waited until time come around that we could afford it
and we had all the necessities and I very seldom use a credit card on necessities I always use it for something I want not something I need
my parents are really good about not using credit cards they are against it
I don't think they like the fact that I have one either I think if cards were as stringent as a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have
of course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so I guess they trade one for the other
I disagree with it but they still trade one for the other
that's good I'm it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so
I'm twenty right now are you?
so just going to school and working so
it does kind of get in the when you want something that last weekend was homecoming and I needed a pair of shoes
so I just went out and bought them on my credit card
I didn't really have the money to do it but it's pretty easy
it sure is so do you just have two kids or we have a eighteen year old seventeen year old and a seven year old
I'm from plano texas are you?
but right now I'm out in provo utah going to b y u so you're a mormon then? but this is a extra long one what's that?
they're giving us a lot of time
they must not have too much traffic on saturdays
have you done a lot of this? fifteen or twenty I guess
do you do it every day? I try to every day I get calls at work I get calls at home so you bet they tell you our topic? pets you've got it
do you have pets? we do my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old and we have a cat which is about five years old how about you guys? we have three dogs and two birds at this point three dogs and two what kind of birds do you have?
parakeets enjoy them?
have a ball with them you let them out and let them fly around and everything?
because my dogs chase them so in order to have the birds not stuffed I have to keep them in their cages
this is like a cruelty joke and I apologize if you're a bird lover but we had a parakeet and my fault put up our first electric fan and never thought about it
knocked that parakeet right out of the air
we had that happen once my son had the bird back in his room because the first one that we had was his bird and I had a ceiling fan put up and the bird got away from him one afternoon and that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall I thought so much for the bird it killed him?
he's still alive and kicking that's it killed ours I'll be darned
I guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot
but it threw him up against the wall and he slid down the wall speaking of pets I'll tell you my kids are older now both of them are either in or out of college but my son had a burmese boa constrictor and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in length
I hate them and finally my wife got rid of it because I didn't really like it
we also had a one year down in florida on a vacation for father's day my kids years ago maybe ten years ago bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop it'd been deactivated as far as smell and everything
and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years and my son left went to school we finally sold his boa constrictor but my son needed some money and we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars you're kidding so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk so I made him a deal I said you take that skunk and he said I'll sell that snake to you for two fifty I said otherwise I'm going to give it to this other man
so he took the skunk too and the skunk was a decent pet but does his little jobbies in the litter box and is
that's pretty good and it was sort of a neat but they just stink too much
that was sort of fun I tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover I use to visualize my wife many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with his head right on her neck you're kidding
and the skunk would be sitting at her feet but the cat would be on the back of the sofa and a dog would be running around crazy
I can not I don't in fact my brother has a exotic pet shop out in california and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail I'm going don't do that because they won't come in my house
my son bought this snake someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school and it was just a small thing then but it got to be pretty big and you feed him small mice to big rats and things like that
it's just too much that snake used to watch our cat walk around I always told my wife your friend's going to get our cat one of these days
that is wild I just can't do those and the lizards and all those things me neither
they need to stay outside far away from me we're down to a simple dog and cat now and that's the way it should be and
haven't had any parakeets for quite a while birds customer of mine has a parrot and sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot and that was just mind boggling
they are so expensive my son was just dying for a bird and I'm really allergic to them so I try to stay away from them except I've gotten real attached to this one are you?
and we went down to canton one time two or three years ago now
and he'd saved up his allowance and picked him out a bird in a bird cage and that stinking bird when I brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you
clamped onto my finger and would not I had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage and he has tried to bite me for two years and all of a sudden this bird and I have become wonderful friends he gives me kisses he talks now that's neat
and it's just hysterical I'm the only one that pays attention to him
and I'm a substitute teacher and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom's making me get rid of the bird we have too many pets I thought come tell me about it come to my menagerie they knew the sucker when they saw one so now we have two parakeets do you have children?
we have two sons one's a freshman in college and one's a sophomore in high school and you? I have one that's a freshman in high school a daughter and a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school
and I spend most of my time carpooling
the story of my life
my kids are involved in sports my daughter has played basketball for six years and my son plays football I my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere
we did spend a lot of time it really helped when the older one was old enough to get his license and could drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems I know I know the insurance
but I for one thing but we do but our two had totally different interests of but there was not much overlap as such the older one was not at all into sports for the most part he participated band and scouts were his two big things my son is in both band and scouts too
and the younger one is the sports one
and whatever season it is he's playing although football is really his favorite
so we spend a lot of time carpooling and then trying to be up as much as possible with anything that they do
but then we also didn't spend time with them trying to just family time
we had a at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth but we didn't do it as much or as often as I would have liked to I would like to do that as a family and some t v watching what about you? we found this oriental tile game called mah jongg
I've heard of that have you?
I've never actually played it but it's really fun one of my neighbors moved here from memphis and a lot of them played it and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people
and it's a game that none of their friends know how to play and they both enjoy it so if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad
so we play that a lot of them and we like to go miniature golfing and to movies
we have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and take car trips
so do we so that and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly
my daughter and I hate camping so we go shopping so that just kind of works out real well
and I'm a writer by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too so a lot of times she and I will travel to writers conferences together that's neat so
we've never had anything like that so that gives us special time together too
and she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so I can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too so
in terms of any sorts of trends I obviously things are different for me and my children than when I was growing up
I grew up on a farm in iowa and the whole family was around the whole time and then what my father did was obvious to me and I helped out with it but although I have brought my boys to see where I work it's not that easy and it's certainly not at all common and they just don't really have that same idea
so they it's a whole different kind of thing there then my husband has taken us to work with him and we still don't know what he does
so we just say he travels a lot so that kind of covers it
that makes it hard though in terms of family time with him
I've been lucky in that respect that I don't travel too much he's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months
so those are the real killers if he's just gone
he's gone three weeks right now and that's mild compare to the big ones
so I just do the carpooling and handle whatever needs to be done and something major always needs to be done
so you just have to handle it until he gets home
and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home
stephanie what's your position on gun control?
on a scale of one to ten being ten no kind of legislation and zero being total ban I probably would lean more towards six or seven I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals
I lived in massachusetts for two years and they have a total ban on guns and I saw that it didn't stop crime in that state was that just on handguns or was that on rifles?
any kind of firearms
it's there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught with a firearm and also I think there was a fine and that didn't help at all?
I don't the crime is not any better or any worse it's
I shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse but it certainly didn't get any better I usually just I'm trying to think of I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the three where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns by any means
but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one right off the shelf
I agree with that but
I think that the law on who can buy a gun are way too lax
I think that the and so I think that kind of control would be good
but the I'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and just to kind of exam it a little bit and I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true only the guns were in the hands of the criminals but how many times I guess I have never heard of a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun
I and maybe they just don't report those or I'm not sure or I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they thwarted the robbery attempt
I'm not really sure personally I don't own a gun
and I don't think I probably ever would although I would like to know how to handle one and I think everybody should learn how to handle one
you just never know when you might come into contact with one
were you brought up in a family that hunted or
nobody in my family hunted my father had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in massachusetts we lived in new hampshire at the time how about that
and he lived in massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns
so we ended up with these guns
and really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere
and so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns and it kind of scared me
but I think that if I learn how to use one I would feel better I've also always thought about the idea most sports which are the n r a and people have their thing if you ban guns you're just banning the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature most of that's done with rifles and such though there's probably some sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous you couldn't be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately if they had to have a rifle or was made it more difficult to get a handgun of course in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want
that's true but to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and temporarily a little bit offset or off keel I don't know if that's a large percentage of crime or not but I guess it would be some but I think definitely today they just introduced what's called the brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns
and I think that that's a good idea I would definitely support that
I agree the thing that scares me though about where I would definitely want some sort of legislation and coming from the north east I'm just not used to seeing these and I know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks that's kind of scary to me
to me it is more like vigilantism
and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in l a on the freeways that's crazy
and then you come here in the dallas area I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles especially not in the back window for everybody to see that's kind of wild
that is kind of wild that's all very interesting thanks for talking you're welcome
what type of magazines do you have?
we take several at home I take skiing magazine and I take discover magazine and also c d and stereo review and national geographic and boys life
that's a good one I like to get so I take it that you like to ski do you receive a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine? I presume that I do
I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because I do get things from ski associations and things during the year
and do you receive discounts and things like that or
not so much that I more likely to see those at a ski show or something but I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and new equipment that's come out and so forth
some fashions are always in there too
would this vacation you're taking did you receive information from your skiing magazine?
probably not we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around I may have referred to a couple of them but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to crested butte
we haven't been there before that sounds nice
kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one
it's supposedly low lift lines
but I haven't skied utah yet but I want to you need to come out
I'd like to go to sundance and park city and some of those
I understand deer valley is nice too deer valley they are it's wonderful snow
how about you what magazines do you have at home? I am currently taking decorative woodworking and country living and we do have national geographic and then we have some church magazines but I really enjoy the decorative woodworking I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that so the decorative woodworking has just been a great great help
does it have articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth?
mostly they have the ads on the equipment but the whole magazine is just filled with pictures and projects that you can make yourself and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project and then how to paint it with the tole paintings and so it's really a fun one I like that
that's good it's good to get use out of one
I'm not sure that in the case of national geographic I read it but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time
but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty eight back issues to find france or something or whatever it is he's looking for
I've noticed that too but they have been nice to have around every once in a while they come in handy
I used to take smithsonian too
I liked that magazine
but I just found myself not ever getting around to reading it
you get so many coming in and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round that
scientific american comes to our house too I forgot and that's mostly my son's
but I do read it too that sounds like
and he takes game magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that
he likes to try that so he does does get to be a lot of paper though after a while if you don't keep them weeded out they almost take over
they can do that I found that they've been fun for my little girls they're five and four years old and they like to go through and
they're just kind of getting started now they like to cut the pictures out and paste them on and so we've found good use for those
mine is a senior in high school so we're kind of at the end of that trail
you're just sort of beginning to think about first grade
it's fun I do have a boy in junior high too so
so you got a little bit of a gap there between so we're kind of running the gamut
perhaps this connection it still echoes do you like to cook? I love it I do too
it's kind of hard to find time sometimes but do you work? and have a family?
I don't have a family I usually work about fifty hours a week and by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal
I expect so for a dinner party I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine
that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party mine is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce
so where did you get your recipe for it? I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have
mine actually came from the texas instruments cafeteria
they they have a t I plant in texas in kingsport?
we have it's in johnson city
and the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes once a month they'll put out a recipe of the month
and they put this one out and I tried it and it was really good what is a marsala wine a sweeter wine?
a little bit sweeter and it's a red wine
and I'm trying to think what else I roll it in bread crumbs and parmesan cheese
and then I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil and pour the wine sauce over it the last twenty minutes so that it gets just enough flavor
so it kind of browns and then you put wine over it that sounds real good
and it's really easy too so what do you use? what do you serve with it?
what do you serve with it?
I like to serve a wild rice with it that's what I do too this is really neat
and I we're big broccoli fans that's what I've got I've got steamed broccoli down on mine
I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that it's great I've got a good dessert recipe
what? do you like angel food cake?
I just break it up in a glass bowl
and then I mix up some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta and some cool whip
and I make a thickened blueberry sauce and I layer it with angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping what time should we be there? that sounds wonderful it is it's great
I love desserts but since there's only two of us it's really
I try to avoid making anything too fancy that we'd like too much and eat too much
I know what you mean we don't eat desserts much any more
but I guess one that I really like that I haven't made in awhile it's called a fruit pizza
and you take a sugar cookie recipe and spread it out on a pizza pan
so you make it like a pizza crust and then you bake that and then you take things like kiwi and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want
you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice and I can't remember what else is in it and you make kind of a glaze
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that and pour that over it? that sounds great
it is really good and it's real light it would be pretty
and it depending on the fruit you use it's real colorful
especially with the kiwi and the strawberries that would be pretty
but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream we've been fixing something lately that we've been cooking a lot of turkey breasts because it's low fat
it's just so much better for you and I've been making a hot sandwich I toast a piece of whole wheat bread and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat swiss cheese
and then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it and pop it in the microwave that sounds great it is delicious I wouldn't mind serving that to anybody
and that's something that just it doesn't take a long time to fix
it's really good and it's really good for you it's real quick
and we eat out a lot and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out
and I wish I had something a little bit different to just zap together
mix up a little mayonnaise with some dijon mustard and honey until it just
I mix it until it just tastes good to me
I was going to say do you just mix it to taste?
and it's real good and it keeps in the refrigerator
how long does it keep do you you wouldn't have to make it keeps a long time
and you wouldn't have to mix that much together even it keeps a long time
I'm sorry I keep coughing I've had a bad cold and I put a little yogurt in it too plain? plain yogurt? if I just plain yogurt it gives it a little tang I'll bet that is really good it makes a great sandwich
I'm going to have to think of that we're getting company tonight are you
and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian that's kind of hard
so we're going to I think we'll try to do something a little bit we might try to grill some flounder or salmon steaks they'll eat fish? she'll eat fish
and I usually when they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce
and definitely go with it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables to make up for the lack of meat that sounds good
I had a recipe from that international cookbook two that's a great salad in summertime do you garden or not?
we don't our next door neighbors do and a lot of times they'll give us something it's just sliced tomatoes and I put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips just over it and some red onion slices and just a little bit of basil and then a little italian dressing over it
and everybody loves it and it's so easy and it's delicious
that's what I was just thinking it doesn't sound like it would be hard at all it isn't where did you get and you can put some cucumber slices on too where did you get this cook book? I got it at the checkbook store
and it's got all these beautiful pictures in there that are inspiring
it's going to say edited by charlotte turgeon editor of laroute gastro lamink the creative cooking course I'll might have to visit the state book store I'm trying to see who it's published by ottenheimer I've never heard of it I haven't either this edition is published by bonanza books
it's a big book but it was not expensive
the ones that I've been wanting to get I guess you've seen the three hundred sixty five ways to cook chicken and the three hundred sixty five ways to cook pasta
I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken we do too
and we do eat a lot of pasta
we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to do without red meat that's right I don't think it would
we don't have that much of it now as long as we have plenty of vegetables and lots of chicken
I stir fried some the other night though some beef and broccoli strips it was good but it didn't have much beef in it
I've got a wok that we don't use near as often as we used to
we used to stir fry a lot especially a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes it just takes the time to cut everything up
but usually if I take a day off or on the weekend especially I try to cook real food cook
and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead
so that we can have those to enjoy
one of my daughters sent me a colorado cook book put out by the junior league of denver
have you ever seen any put out by junior leagues?
cause we have some local ones they are great
and we have a share alike column in the paper where people write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe
and that's where I get a lot of my recipes they are usually good aren't they?
and I got a real good one from a doctor's office one time is that right what was that?
it's a baked bean recipe
and you mix baked beans and lima beans and let's see I guess you buy the canned baked beans?
just mix the canned beans together and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup
and you just bake it and it's like a spicier baked bean dish that sounds
and you can add hamburger if you want to give it a little more body that sounds good
so I try to always keep my eyes open because a lot of time you can find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it
so I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse jot them down? but it's been
the topic is hobbies
in your spare time who has spare time?
I don't really do any handicraft things like that I used to I used to do salt ornaments and things
but that was good many years ago and I really my spare time
I usually go do aerobics and read and that's about it
I understood that I work full time and I have two kids so my spare time usually involves something with the kids
hobbies I can't really say that we have hobbies it's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend we like to go out
family that's what I meant by salt that we did that as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it during the christmas season making them up for other people and things like that but as far as
I've just never been very skilled at far needle work cloths
and the things I've tried to do just don't look very good and
I guess mostly as far as crafts go I've done some needlepoint I've done mostly cross stitching I used to do one that I did for both kids are they're plaques with different kind of animals and then you have their birth date on them
and then you have a little picture of them and you frame them and stuff
but nothing steady just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it but it's nothing that I can really it's not like you sit and knit every night
not at all I don't even know how to knit and my mother used to knit all the time
and I don't even know how to knit
I'm that's a lost art from this family
but it's not a very good topic it feels like if
not when you're neither one of us are really I have seen things I really like that were done especially like needlepoint
needlepoint cushions and things
but it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it and that the petty point and things like that
it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made
I don't know what it's like there but here a lot of the country stuff is in a lot of the woodwork a lot of stenciling
and you can go to a flea market and stuff and there's just tons of stuff everywhere and people just do it in their garage
and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more and they do that as their job whereas for us it
and they make it cheaper for us to buy
and I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because I can remember when I used to do those figurines and things it was relaxing creative you felt very creative
but it just was so much time involved and the different steps and things and
I think we're okay I think we did the five minutes so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore
thank you I hope you have a good rest of your weekend
I have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject
so I'll tell you is it a serious problem? I do believe it's a serious problem
however there are solutions to it
and foremost where we compare that we are now doing fifty percent of our people are voting we're probably making a comparison against some european and newer republics that have very high percentages
so one of the reasons that it is lower in the united states is that mostly we hold it on tuesdays god knows why we hold it on tuesdays and then we further complicate it by saying we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock what
a great number of people now work at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the polls in any case if they have to work late into the evening and not get up my solution to that is that we hold it on sundays as do probably sixty to seventy percent of the european countries now
they hold it on the weekends? they hold it on either a saturday or a sunday or at least a day when a great number of people are not working sunday
in america that is not true because a great number of people work on sundays
but that is one of my solutions
I know here in dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections and I do not think they have seen a really high improvement have you absentee voted in texas?
I always vote I have absentee voted in new hampshire and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot
I do not say that it is that complicated but part of the process also is that you must preregister at some particular point new hampshire is fairly easy but other states you have to register every couple of years to just vote to absentee vote specifically?
so registrations are perhaps a problem also and we're the mobile society
people are always one out of every seven people moves every year that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every
if you compound that if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote
but I do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard
and the people that I have talked to maybe that is another factor the motivational factor the motivational factor is probably
I think that is the biggest one I
that's the biggest problem I that's diminished by w we have noticed this in particular I just read two books one of them is whose stars and stripes now?
the trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty eight
it's a fairly decent book it's preceded by several other books by these guys
wake me up when it's over was about the eighty four elections and I forget what the other books were
but any case i i it is the there was blue smoke and mirrors was the one in eighty two these guys have taken the place of theodore white on reporting elections in any case they say that there's a definite trend toward candidates using negative voting it is the only way that you can use television effectively
I don't understand that is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public? and the public's gullibility? the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than a positive factor
and if you go on the attack and put some sensational thing before the public and it is not refuted people will believe it if you don't refute it as he didn't there must be some truth to the matter he did refute it
he refuted it it just was not effective enough to he didn't refute it til the last two weeks of the campaign he didn't believe anybody would believe that and indeed his trend started upward
I didn't believe anybody would believe that either I guess I have a hard time coming to terms with the fact that the american public really was so they do
don't give too much credit to the american public for their motivational ability and it
then how can a democracy work then? it I don't know
how can it work? is it working? that's the question I guess the question also that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out everybody seems disappointed
but they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal
my solution to part of this is to make it an economic incentive for people to vote that sounds rather crass because then you are saying y y it could be convoluted in many ways where people would actually by paying them what?
you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever
but it would be very difficult to administer because I am sure that any time money and votes are involved the whole thing just stinks
how about the reverse of that?
when I have heard about england's elections they are allowed to run for a total of six or eight weeks even for the higher offices in the land what if we just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue? I feel like if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls a a and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls
I don't care how easy it is for them I do not think they are going to because they do no think that anybody listens to their vote they think whoever has the they really think that the packs no matter what you're promised during a campaign and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance you mean the special interest groups?
and no matter what a candidate promises during the campaign which isn't very much they do not promise anything specific these days but whatever you are promised they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office I think that's the read my lips and no new taxes and yet bush did that but he's excused from that
generally people I've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget
then why did he say that during his campaign? he gave it he promised the best he could
then he it was totally and he is the president and he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time what was so funny about it is that it happened so rapidly he knew it he actually knew it and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that and maybe he will
but I think it is er r r I think you still have a view that the american voter is different from other voters
and he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that I think voters are motivated
what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about? like in the european countries where they have higher turnouts? and the newer democracies because it's going to be totally different but I don't know if they have higher turnouts overall you do not think so? I don't think england has I think england has about a seventy percent sixty five percent turn out
I think that we just discovered in the indian elections is one of the greatest and massive things in the world
just it got more violent every year
they went down almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up ghandi but simply because people were so concerned about their inability that their vote does not count any way and the corruption of politics in that s s situation there
but everything is relative to when we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter?
is but before this voting rights act what we had was a great deal of our population mainly the blacks in the south and the hispanics were precluded by voting laws from their eligibility to register
now everybody is available
so if you really computed it they probably when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty we really only had a fifty percent turnout because all the eligible voters I see because
weren't it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of were disqualified
but isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and hispanics and other minorities just don't vote? or is that just the truth? I think there's a higher percentage in certain black areas of voters I don't know about hispanics I haven't studied the statistics well enough to
I think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction
but that just made me think of something that happened down here in dallas last year they have this huge fight going over redistricting here
and at one point they took another vote on it and the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to pass their plan and this is something that had been going on for months it was on the news every night and they have had lawsuits over it it was a major issue and there still wasn't enough minority vote to pass the plan that they were backing so that's I think that you have really hit on something there to say that those what do you mean?
with the minorities and we are saying we have lower voter turnout maybe it is now that we have minorities included in the karen I wonder if we are recording why did you not press one? I did press one but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up what do you think?
I'm thinking about from one to ten what my no would be it would probably be somewhere closer to less control because I don't see I'm not a member of the n r a although my father is
but I think the n r a has gone overboard the wrong way they're sitting there on number ten they're saying absolutely no gun control we don't even want to think about it
and I think that's a dumb situation
because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose if you're going to hunt with it or if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week that's true
it's not a big deal for them to go if they can check your driver's license every time you get a ticket they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed felony record that's true
any of that kind of stuff and it seems to me right now that there's not that much of a check I'm not really sure what texas law I think there's a check for felonies on your record but
if the gun shop owner does it
but but he has to go out and do it that's true I think
and if it's a private sale of course then there's nothing and that's my only problem with making you get the check and everything is I guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys they are going to get a gun no matter what
they're not I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check I think they're going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that
but maybe we'll prevent a few john hinckleys I hope that's true
I that's the kind of people like I say I don't think the guy who's going to rob a seven eleven is going to rob a seven eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or whatever knife he's going to do what he wants to do
but that's true I just think it makes honest people more honest and
and the people who want it it's not that big a deal like I say to wait and if you have to have it in a hurry something's wrong
it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here that's right that's right
I'm married to a policeman so we talk about this a lot
I imagine his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more I was watching a
if I was a cop I would be worried about that
too many people have too much access they do they do
and I think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of some of these saturday night specials that these companies put out they are
basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven or even the little toy guns look real
that's really gotten bad I've heard so much about that on tv and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one
or your child accidently
if your child is old enough there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve or fourteen and especially some of the minority children whether a racist or not
that's the truth and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up you can't blame them it looks like they've got a weapon you can't
and you can't take the chances that's right
because there's been kids that age who have killed people
and there was a law in oregon where they've now made all toy guns they're making them neon colors and I think that's a good idea
and the kids don't care that's right my kid didn't care I know
he picks up a stick and goes bang it doesn't make any difference to him a gun is a gun to them
they can play with anything and make it a gun that's exactly right
so you like to do I think they ought to do that with toy guns they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them
so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun that's right that's a good idea I was watching t v yesterday and there is a town in georgia and it's the law that you have a gun every adult is able to carry a gun and they encourage it that's kind of
they encourage it? and the police love it which really surprised me
I think and that's what they were going after they went to interview this town it's a little dinky town they went to interview them about the gun control laws and the police said all the people said that's fine we could care less we're all honest and everything like that
we all carry them but we don't mind being checked and I think it kind of took that neatness away from it everybody's got one and so it was quite unusual to see the people in that town I don't know I
that's kind of an odd thing I don't know I have a gun and my folks have always had I learned to shoot when I was real little
I think that's a lot of it too is that people need to teach their kids what to do and what not to do
because my dad started letting me shoot a little air b b gun when I was probably five or six years old
but it was this is how you hold it this is the only place that you do it which was out far and away
and you don't ever touch it unless I'm here and you don't point it at people that's what we're doing
and then they had then they went to the texas parks and recreation but the hunter safety program that you have to do now
I think it started in about nineteen seventy
if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday's after nineteen something fifty five or something then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses that's neat
or you can't get a deer license that's real neat
and it's basic stuff it's when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence don't lean your gun against it
and then you crawl over it and shoot yourself
and those things happen that's real good
it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people and they usually are real basic common sense things
put the safety on the gun
always assume it's loaded that's got to be the most common thing that people I know and people don't want to believe that
it's empty it's empty I I took the clip out or whatever and I forgot about the one in the chamber in the chamber that's exactly right
we're trying to teach our daughter she knows real well about her daddy's guns what not to do and what to do around them
does he got them locked up all the time too? when he's and she's real she'll know she'll even tell her friends don't ever touch my daddy's guns or something like that
don't even think about it
so she's real good about it and she's never been curious
cause he's always if he has them out cleaning them she can be there and he'll tell how he's doing it or show her the insides or stuff like that
if you make it where it's not something curious to be feared and
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about
if it's just one more piece of something but they've got to understand like you said never touch it they'd have that respect for what it does and what it can do
ours is a we have a shotgun and it's up in the closet
and then the shells are in another part and it's something to think about and I got it because my husband used to travel and be out he was out of the country at one time for three months
and I was I live in a nice neighborhood but still still
and then I've got it so far sometimes I wonder if I'm not about to load it because I assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there
and it's in a case and it's put up and it's away and all that but I don't want to take the chance and I think if somebody ever does break in it's going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it he's got to go to a lot of trouble hold on hold on
he's in here somewhere I know he is
I know how to use one we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and I really enjoy it but if someone did break in I don't know that I could or would even grab it
I know I used to think about that it was a lot easier when I was single it was one thing and when I was just married with no kids when it was just me it was an easy decision that's true
it was you come after me you're going to get it
and now there's so many other things where are the kids what are they doing where is this person coming in from
you've got and if you manage to get it out then how can you even afford to think about what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are at the same time
we have dogs that are very protective
we feel if they make enough noise that if they're stupid enough to come through then
it we have two big dogs in the backyard and always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer
they've got to be pretty stupid and most people that break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs luckily
anything that the any advantage that they can take and that's one of them so unfortunately
guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years really does do you think we've
I think that's about all I can me too on gun control
we're in pretty good agreement actually on it I think we are
it would be even more interesting you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum I'm glad you're not
me too I'm glad to find there's another reasonable person in garland
it's been nice talking to you you too all set do you want to start? I can go ahead and start
go ahead in dallas there's definitely a crime problem I know it's worse in the larger cities it's kind of a concern for me in fact at the moment I'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and it's I am single and female you definitely are going to worry about the location and accessibility of people to be able to break in I live on a third floor now but I'm real concerned that I don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that and the
do they have many buildings that have security there? some buildings do it depends on the location the area I live in right now is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that
I went to dallas when I worked for t I in abilene and I'm a little familiar with the city area forest lane and through that off the freeway
and it didn't seem like it was that congested in that part because to me where we live out here in the north east there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
and the cities are very populated with tenement housing where there are more than one family in a house and with the people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language
and they're going to the big cities it makes it very difficult
it really does and I've seen the same thing that you're talking about much more crime than ever before drugs of course a big part of it I think
and I don't know a lot of younger people into more violent crimes
that's really sad you got young boys or girls at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever there's a lot of that going on in dallas too it's really sad
it is and I don't know if it's the family thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television
and I really think that we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people I agree I think that people are getting off too easy they're getting paroled too easily
they're just getting put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room so they get lighter sentences
and some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose
and they had in fact on the news last night we were watching this man who lost his ten year old daughter he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone ten years old she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes
and while he was gone he had went looking for a job and stopped at the store that's what it was and someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her and the whole bit
and one of the men got seventeen years and the other one was in for life imprisonment
the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and he's out that's terrible
and the man said that if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not think a thing about it
and I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands and that innocent people
I shouldn't say innocent because I mean actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but
the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it it's two different things
sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things I don't know it's a little more understandable under the circumstances I guess
I like the idea that if someone is from a foreign country and they come to this country and commit a crime that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
especially if they're found guilty of the crime
once they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty
that's it we don't take care of them we don't support them nothing
they go right back where they came from we have enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is so let their country take care of it
and we don't have too much trouble in dallas with I guess we do have a lot of people come in from mexico that cause problems but
but they're so close I don't consider mexican people in the same category with especially people who come from cultures that don't have the same kind of moral upbringing that we have
you take asian countries or the eastern countries where women are in the background and the men are in the foreground
and it's like they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago
we've advanced beyond that and I think that their mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what I mean it was amazing I went to the far east back in october to do some training for t I and I
some of those countries were so safe it was unreal singapore is supposed to be very safe and in fact tokyo and I thought tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people
but they at the t I there I said is there any area I should avoid and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where dana shouldn't go by herself or anything and she thought for a few minutes and she said no and he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself she said no and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
and somebody will turn it in and nothing will be missing they said they can just about guarantee that there that that would happen if you did that I thought in america if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again
you better believe it if you wouldn't even have to leave it that's true
it would get snatched right off your arm that's true but I was thinking in dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out
I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place they said apparently the crime is just
that's amazing what's the difference there do you know? I'm not sure what it is there I know what it is in singapore is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it
I believe in the death penalty I really do for drugs they enforce the death penalty for that they're just very very tough and I guess maybe that's the way tokyo is too or japan is too they're just very tough on criminals
I think that we're too easy
and we take the civil liberties stuff too far
people that are in prison we didn't put them there they put themselves in that situation
and as far as them entertaining the rights that they should have
we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
I'm not saying they're all bad but I think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives
I think that they should be put away and if they're overcrowded they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place get rid of them
I think that that's the whole key here this plea bargaining baloney where they plead to a lesser crime or they plead guilty or tell about someone else and they get less time
or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior for every year they're in they get so many less that they don't serve the full penalty
I really think we're going to far overboard with all of this I agree because it's not fair to those of us that deserve a safe life to have to
same with drunk drivers
I think it's too easy for them
that if the laws were harsher and were enforced
you have to set an example you have to start somewhere
and I think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
an I feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people this craziness people with automatic weapons and all this other stuff and trying to do a job
and let's face it what do they get paid not much
twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky I wouldn't do it for that and especially not in some of these big cities in dallas they've had they're up in the top five of cities that are getting policeman killed in the line of duty and that's really sad
it is it really is and they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything
and I'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything
but they have three strikes against them when they're out there
because they'll arrest someone and go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them what they say return anything
the only things that I have returned have not been faulty
it's been because of the size or some problem like that
I really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to most the time they have a pretty good guarantee the only thing I've had lately is my kids got all these barbie kind of toys for christmas and it takes them less than a day and they're broken in one way or another but I don't know if that's just kids or if that's maybe those type of products should be for older kids
what age are your children? I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them
and I don't think they're unduly rough but maybe they are I don't know but a lot of the little barbie sets they come with real little pieces and they're easily lost and easily broken but
my daughter is twenty one now so it's been a while since we've had barbie things it's been a while since they've gone through the barbie stuff
but we did have barbies and things and there seems to me that that became a craze when she was already third fourth fifth grade
so she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it but I don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff don't remember her breaking
I don't but I also don't remember lots of little pieces they've got so many different things with it now that's one thing they've got they've got every type of imaginable camping on the beach and all of these come with tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses and
my three and a half year old has wanted this ken doll and so I finally got her a ken doll and less than a week later the arm was broken
but they were real good about replacing it that's one nice thing is they're real good about replacing it
I guess if they'll replace them then they assume they shouldn't have broken those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way and
any direction she's not that big of a girl that I think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could
the main thing that they had when my daughter was playing with barbies was just clothes
that was about it that was about it
and the barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff but
and the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics my children are twenty one and twenty five and twenty eight is that right?
and do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things?
not really we haven't had that much problem with things that we have bought they seem to last in fact when they offer us extended warranties we don't buy them because we find we don't need them don't buy them because you don't need them
and it seems like it's just an added tack on plus a lot of the credit cards now will guarantee if you purchase on your credit card then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time
so it seems like it's a waste of money
you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it it's usually before that warranty would expire any the first one
and on a recliner once I bought an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that and I never used it you never even needed it
and so it seems ridiculous and washers and dryers and things like that I've never had one go out in fact they usually when they do go out it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix and we don't even have a repairman come or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing it's time to replace it
so I think these extended warranties are gimmicks really
I do too a lot of it when we first married we bought one on our t v and that there's after the first five years and it was ridiculous
and they charge you a pretty good price for them too they're a pretty healthy price and you're trying to think maybe I'll need this you always think if I say no then I won't but
my husband finally just put his foot down I don't know
and he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore and if it goes out you probably got your worth out of it anyway
so we really have been fairly happy with things but now we take good care of things and we don't run out and buy a lot of things either and since our kids aren't little anymore I'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken the little you probably are real careful of the brands you buy and when you do buy things you probably watch what type of
you look at the consumer guide
and you go around and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
I was going to say my college is northern state university in aberdeen south dakota and our head football coach dennis muir used to be an assistant coach at b y u
so I thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence
so you went to what college? northern state university in aberdeen south dakota and what did you graduate in? I in what major or what year?
major international business and you?
I'm going to b y u and I'm going into nursing
so that sounds interesting how long of a program is that? forever
seems like it's about five years but it's probably going to take me longer because I didn't decide to major in that until about a year and a half after I was already in school so I read a study once and it said that like thirty four percent of college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program
that sounds it took me five years
so you get started and you change your mind or you want to pick up a second major if you're management you thought I'll take that marketing it only was three more classes
and just doesn't happen that you get out in four years but
what is your advice to picking a college my advice is look at the student to faculty ratio if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one
what was yours more like? was there a it was about twenty six to one
that's great which is it's interesting but it's what I thought was nice is there was always time to talk to professor and they knew you
you weren't just in their class and so you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you could sit down talk to them about a problem they're always willing to help you out but I put that against my high school where we had a biology class of three hundred and fifty students and in high school?
it was a biology lecture class
and it just wasn't the same you're sitting there and you're taking notes and you got a computerized test scores multiple choice because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty person short answer test
and it just wasn't the same you'd pass the teacher in high school and even in high school you could say high to your teachers unless you're in that biology class and they'd look at you like do I know you? or should I know you?
it's the classes here are pretty big so it's hard to get individual help it's kind of you're on your own do you get a lot of tutoring or
very little my for example I'm in a chemistry class right now and there's tons of students in it and there's one t a for the whole class
and he only has certain office hours and so there's only certain times you can talk to him and and you could get there and he could have a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty two people waiting to talk to him and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway
what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college?
I think your advice is good let's see my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college that's excellent advice
because I didn't and I took tons of classes that I didn't need to and I don't know I just feel like it's going to take me a lot longer than and not that's always bad but it's I don't know it's frustrating I guess it does get it you get to the point where I'm never going to get done
I was taking summer classes and let me get out of here
but that's good advice even if you don't have your major decided on have an idea what you think you might want you don't want management but you think you want business
the question was what is your opinion of youth spending a year or two in public service
I think it would be a great idea I'm not sure about requiring it of people because people are going feeling resentful I don't know but I think it would be a great idea
seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of what they want to be or do or they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time and all countries sure need help so would you be more in favor of a local my only experience with it I was in central america for a while and in san salvador in el salvador
for instance everybody had what they called there social year that they had to put in
and basically it was a repayment for high school education
and most of them joined the red cross and it was done internally I just there was very little external I think possibly what they're thinking about here more external peace corps type things where we're sending people off shore
I think that would be real interesting for people to do but I guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them to other countries
but I don't know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really send children to do that
I didn't know I don't know how the peace corps works I guess I was of age when the peace corps came in and all that I was too I thought seriously about joining at that time I thought it was a fantastic idea did you ever get any information on it like
I sent off for stuff on it but I don't remember that much about it I know that they trained you in the language and that's what I was wondering about was whether they actually
you actually got paid too while in the peace corps it wasn't much
but I guess you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses and wasn't jimmy carter's mama that was in the peace corps? I think so
but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them to some other country that had different moral values like saudi arabia where they couldn't drink where they couldn't do that you might end up with a revolution I don't know which end though
that's been interesting though the kids that have been over coming back right now
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say that's not a bad way to do it because from what I understand from some of the guys I know crime is punishable just almost instantly and public
public hanging public hanging and this sort of thing so you don't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes
I've heard that in china and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered on the street so I guess that's the price of freedom is a little the public service thing again I guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to give it a great deal of thought I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary
but when you do that then it becomes almost a or it can be
there have people will kind of set up their own little club that's true but if
people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that
might not go if it was voluntary but I don't know how they'd enforce it if it was if they went awol what are you going to do shoot them put them in jail
I don't know send them over to iraq
have a vacation in iraq for a year I know my dad always talked about he was in c c c during
and he was a rock rib iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about the whole roosevelt administration was civilian conservation corps
because he was in it he thought that was great
the rest of it was all hog wash but that was great
it seems like it would develop pride in people if it's in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way I it would take quite a few people I think it might build jobs for people that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too
I don't know the only
to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and that brings up the interesting subject too who would determine what these people do
if it's run by the individual state c c c was run by the army and in effect
and the only opposition to it really was that it was starting some sort of a military elitist type special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing
and when the politics get real confusing
really there could be some scandals involved if it wasn't people that were really fair and in a legal way or something
they could send all the people over to one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to get supported or
we've gotten to the point where if the racial make up of the group was such and such they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and that kind of thing
that could be a complicated too couldn't it
suppose they had a group who were construction oriented and they went and they built a swimming pool or anything and one you can only build it in one place and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream you didn't build one over here
that's true unfair or something I think
it's one of those things on the surface it seems like a great idea it's like a joke I heard once about elephant foot soup it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot
it's the logistics of the thing that gets you going
it seems like there's a lot you don't hear much on the news about young people really wanting to do anything good or anything like that but I'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing I saw on the news the other night that the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the cosby show kisha knight pullman was starting a I guess now she's practically a teenager
she started some type of national organization for youth to volunteer to tutor other kids to read and do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards helpful things and I know everyone in the high schools in dallas there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start a minority I think it was in a hispanic area they wanted to start a club for the teenagers instead of all these gangs kids could join to belong
but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping
so they were trying to start that out so if there's kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy we ought to use them if they're willing to do it
it's just the here you are to the logistics of the thing again
who's going to run it what how it's just so many
like I said at the beginning I've got so many connections with people in central america my daughter in law is panamanian
and they have situations like that down there where they have the social in some sort of way
if you want to go to school outside the country they'd go to school in cornell iowa of all places
and when they came back they'd have to serve this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones I knew always chose the red cross because they didn't do anything
I see and they had all kinds of things they could go into agricultural and really good stuff
but unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that red cross it was so many of them in it that your chance of having to do something it was very slim and so
we belong to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints which is the mormon church
and there is men and also women women aren't nearly as frequent and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission and they're all over the world and it's incredible logistics they have a training center where they teach them it's called the missionary training center in utah and they have to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things
and then they go and actually live in that country for the young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months then that's kind of a private organization
I'm familiar with my instructor pilot was a mormon he was a good instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible
he had a direct connection somewhere he felt that he really had an in so things he would do with an airplane
but any rate that's off the subject but I
they don't get paid for it but there is funding that comes they're supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some
but you know that it is incredible I see how they were organized in central and south america and it's
cynthia what did you wear to work today?
let's see what did I wear to work today? actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse and flat shoes so can you dress pretty casually?
on occasion on occasion
I do vary I wear suits I wear skirts and sweaters on occasion I can wear jeans how about you? I run a business out of my home
so I tend to get up in the morning put on sweats do whatever I want to do with the kids then whenever I have a meeting with a client I'll put a suit on and then come home and get back into regular clothes again
there's no real dress code where I work you see people wearing all different attire I don't like to wear heels that really tires me out I work in a big building
so I predominantly wear flat shoes in the winter I wear sweaters in summer I like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that I've recently tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that I can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot
that's helped me a lot with having I can only have a limited wardrobe since I'm only working part time right now
but still it gives it some variety add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that
accessories what about your casual wear? do you like to wear jeans most of the time?
mostly at home I predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also it's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so hot
they're like dress shorts
they're black corduroy bermuda shorts
and sometimes I wear a blazer with them and I get really a lot of compliments on them where I work is predominantly male
so they their attire is always the same suits or slacks jeans whatever but
but I'm really the only woman at work that does that but seems to work for me but
in fact I just got a new outfit as a gift that it's one of those skorts it's shorts but it looks like a skirt
so I think that'll be good for work too it'll be comfortable
so I guess down here we just recently moved to texas so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit
we moved from colorado where and I have a closet full of sweaters that
I live in virginia you live in virginia now? that's interesting
so I'm right now today was in about the fifties
but I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses I'd like to be able to wear those here today it's eighty eight degrees
needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now
today was definitely a shorts day around here
we're still pretty much in winter as far as that goes here this is pretty unseasonal but at least we it feels good it gets everybody doesn't have cabin fever today it's nice to get out and about
I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing sounds good
it was nice talking to you
it was nice talking to you also
what basketball teams are you interested in?
I guess I'm a big l a laker fan when it comes to pros
the college ranks I really of course I try to follow my alma mater that's b y u in utah
but they don't have much of a team usually they're more of a football team than they are basketball team
you see them in football on t v once in awhile
you never see them on nationally basketball that's true I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball
last year they had a really good team the year that danny aines was there
that was about five six years ago by now
so they made it to the sweet sixteen once or twice in their history that's not too bad
and that's and they usually lose in the first round
how about you? I'm originally from the saint louis area so the only basketball team in that part of the country is chicago so I do pull for chicago
of course this year is a good year to be a chicago fan because they're doing pretty good
is it the bulls you're talking about?
the pro as far as college teams I know it's really easy to say but I've been pulling for duke for about four years now so I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams although I've really is that right? again being from saint louis I pull for missouri
but they're on probation this year so you can't do much about that but
did you watch the final four this year? I watched all three games of that
every game? and I was very pleased with all three games because kansas I was pulling for kansas on the other side so it was real nice to have the teams that were there
of course I wasn't really I u n l v kind of gave me the impression of being a macho team they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and maybe they were but I was real happy to see them get knocked off so I watched that game
and it was a good game
it was a very close game and hard fought game and it just I don't know it looked like u n l v may have had more talent
but as far as playing together as a team that day duke seemed to have them off balance
and that they couldn't aren't they more of a running gun team? u n l v they play the pro style is what I've always called it and
fast breaks and things and the fast breaks and
they shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed and and u n l v wasn't used to that of course I knew whenever u n l v went in at half time I don't know if they were necessarily behind but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are
and that meant that they had to play a second half and they've not had to do that all year and
they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that when it counts so much that's right duke's schedule was so much harder than u n l v's that it just made them a much tougher team overall
and that had to help them a lot
I think that probably was the difference in that game
because it really could have gone either way down to the end do I take it that you think though that the lakers will win or
I don't know probably not portland's pretty good
since kareem's retired they haven't had a center
and they've got perkins
but I don't think he's really been a super star for them he's I don't I he to me is not a center he's more of a real tall forward
I think magic does a
they'll make it it's going to be a war between chicago and boston celtics that's going to be a war that sure is it
it's going to be a great series I think that's going to be one of those that's won by the home team
whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think
one of those two will probably be in there let me see where does detroit fit in? detroit's in that same division
so I don't know those three detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year but as I heard isaiah came back this week
so that might help them
they have the play off experience but
all three of them do with larry bird back you can never count the celtics out when larry bird's starting to click on all cylinders that's true
they say he's starting to play but he's been kind of up and down all year
one game he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time he can't seem to hit the side of a barn so I don't know
I'm not sure about him this year
last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now that's when you do it
he's starting to be more consistent at the right time of the year
any dark horses I the dark horses
san antonio is the dark horse that could really flip in there I think that's
anybody who has david robinson has got to have a chance anyway
he's got to be pretty much I use to say akimo lija was the dominant player when he against any team he would dominate but robinson's getting up there where every game he's just that's right
it looks like he's going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back
nobody's got enough beef to challenge him when he's driving hard to the hoop
he's too bad the mavericks couldn't get him that's true
with roy tarpley they're in big trouble then he's gone now so they don't have to worry about that
for awhile anyway I thought he was gone period I didn't read the story but I read that
I heard he was suspended because of his that might have been what it was
but I guess the headlines said something about him that the mavericks released him or something maybe I misunderstood what they meant
if they did they'd still have to pay his contract they may have done it you never know
it was a lot of money he was making but
I heard on the radio it was sixty three thousand and change a month that's what he was being paid he wasn't even playing
what a good job he had that's what I think
he ruined his sweet position
I'm looking forward to the pro play off it's coming up isn't it
l a san antonio who's the other one that's doing so well this year is that portland? portland portland
portland I haven't seen them on much t v that much at all but all I can do is hear about they have the seeing eye
what do they have walter davis and they've got the two johnson brothers or they're not brothers but I mean there's two guys named johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something I forget how that works but like I said they're doing extremely good right now
phoenix isn't doing too bad so it ought to be a real interesting play off
I don't think there's any clear pick
I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the celtics because of bird and the lakers because of magic johnson they are two guys that seem to find a way when they when it's on the line
when it's on the line they seem to find a way
so those are what makes a champion I guess that's true
it's been nice talking to you
nice talking to you take care take care
do you go camping very much?
I haven't gone camping in years but it's is something that I've done in the past how about you? we try to go once maybe twice a summer just for a short weekend or something
that's pretty average to me we don't go for the week long thing
but we usually go to a lake area where the campsites are and do that
do you tent camp or do you have a camper? a tent
that's what I that's how I camp too that's how I define camping me too you're really roughing it
the rest of that is really not the same
as a matter of fact the majority of the amount of camping I've done has been really roughing it as a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother and we went to the boundary waters area in minnesota so that's really wild
are you here in local texas I mean?
I'm in austin where are you? I'm in garland
right outside of dallas
so we have a five year old and she was pretty young when we started camping with her
the kids love it I know
they just love it it's wonderful for them to be outside I know and they there's no t v and they don't have all these modern toys and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with
and I like that it's pretty fun
how it it's really is a good family thing to do
and we try to go with another couple that have children also
and that makes it a lot more enjoyable plus we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff we kind of split it up
good planning because it really does get expensive if you don't want to rough it all the way
even the sleeping bags those are running a good thirty dollars a pop and so we've built that up you're right but do you have a boat?
want one bad do you?
actually you know what I would love? I would absolutely love a sail boat
that doesn't go along with camping but that's what I would like to have I would too
would too we usually let's see we try to go to a lake my husband and this other couple that we go with her husband kind of likes scuba dive? and so we'll go to a lake where they can go do that
we're close enough so they can do that and the girls can play on the beach area
and I would play on the beach area too
that's what I would do that's fun
I'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that am I pretty texan? you're pretty texan
but you know what's really funny? I've had people tell me that I have a texas accent and there is just no way I've not picked one up you don't sound like it to me
I've only lived here about six years have you?
so if I have one it must be very very slight
the yankees can hear it that's true that's true I don't think I do but a lot of people do say I sound like I have more of a twang to my voice
are you a native texan? I sure am
I've lived here all my life good for you but
have you ever been to austin? we went last summer actually
this how was I'm wondering I'm really not familiar I know there are some good places to go camping along the lakes is there? we didn't go camping we drove down to houston to visit friends and we went to galveston and to san antonio and then up to austin and kind of doing the sight seeing type stuff
so we didn't go camping that would be fun though to go that's one thing my husband wanted to do on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went and I said I'd love that but
it takes a lot more planning it does and ever once on my week long vacation I want to be a little bit pampered by a hotel and a waiter
so we're hoping to do a three day weekend there's a thing called pfeiffer rim I don't know if you have ever heard of it?
I haven't there's a town called glenrose I think it's around two hours from here and it has dinosaur tracks and stuff like that
that sounds great and it's got one of those wildlife parks
I think that'll be fun so we're going to try to do that on a three day weekend go there and
have you ever camped out of state? I haven't
where you should try sometime is colorado where at? it is beautiful is it?
absolutely beautiful I've just been up there skiing and we've driven through but not camping or anything
but I would love to camp in the mountains
estes state park is fantastic that's what my girlfriend says she loves that place
you need to go there she loves that she says that where we need to go sometime
it is it's high canyon and there's this little mountain lakes and it's very peaceful
and in the early fall time
I can't remember what type of trees they are but all the leaves turn yellow and it's just brilliant and I love that
you would you'd like it very much that's neat that's neat
I know you would I used to go camping all the time as a girl scout I was too all the time I got real used to it then
I felt like we roughed it then
we did we really did I just don't understand these people that think taking an r v and parking it and sitting inside and watching t v and having your microwave
it's not camping we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything
that is it you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping
you say you haven't been in years?
I haven't I'm a struggling single mom bless your heart and thank you
it's time is precious money's precious
and it I think I haven't been able to do it and that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my children again and I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women I don't blame you you know? I don't blame you at all I hope years ago it would have been fine but
I really now I have gone on one little vacation just the girls and I we drove down to port aransas and rented a little efficiency and had a marvelous two nights
and that was great and even at that it was the first time that I ventured out of the city by myself
and I stayed in a nice place but it's real different not to have another adult with you I you know I can imagine I'm just a chicken
I know lots of women would do it all the time I don't blame you not nowadays
I haven't quite adjusted? are you with t I down there?
I was with t I until january I left t I in january hoping to strike out and find a job where I could make some money
so it was a good plan but I haven't yet have you?
I got into sales and I'm selling telephone systems that's neat
and it's fun and it's interesting but it's also pretty challenging and I haven't started making money yet it's hard isn't it?
so it's hard how old are your girls? eleven and fourteen
so I'm old you're not old you're not old at all
excuse me just second
honey I'll be go ahead there's someone at the door do you need to go?
I'm going to listen we always check and see if we should answer the door at night that's very smart
so I've enjoyed this me too
and and good luck how many have you made so far calls?
I haven't made any I've been just a recipient have you? they're all this is only about my second one I've ever made I've been a recipient on the others how many have you had so far do you know? I think I've had about four four that's good very good
that's four each when I had to this is my gemini nature it's like what are you interested in
and it's virtually anything I'll talk about anything to anybody I don't you bet you bet
and it's been real interesting the different personalities that I run across I know
I always try to find out where they're from because it is neat it really is
then I guess I'll let you go so you can go get the door and
thank you and I enjoyed talking with you me too
you have a good time camping when you go next time think of me thank you
do you exercise regularly I sure do
what do you do? I ride a bicycle quite a bit and work out with free weights
I love to ride a bicycle I live right near white rock lake so I try to ride about ten to twenty miles a day but I haven't been doing so well this year that's good but
last year I went an was exercising on a bike for a while and when I'd gotten back I had gotten some sun that day the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel it was the sweating not the burn that's weird
that was wild but I don't exercise now I just had a baby three months ago I haven't really gotten back into exercising
but I exercised real good for a couple of years it was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week and it was running three nights a week what's your motivation?
what's my motivation?
a friend of mine always pushing me this was in louisiana and she would push she was let's go do it and she wouldn't take for an answer was it for health or to look good?
I just wanted to look good I was think it wasn't really health related it was just a side benefit
because I'm not big or anything but I'm not in great shape but when I worked out I got in pretty good shape I didn't build up muscle though I just got real good and toned I don't think women look good with muscles up to a point up to a point
it's just some of those women that come up there looking like arnold schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it what was the other question let's see do you do it as a task or do you enjoy working out
I guess it's a task'cause I can't make myself do it lately I think I enjoy it sometimes and there's other times when I just get tired of it and I feel like I'm obligated to do it because I've been doing it so I should keep up
you don't want to lose yourself and there's some days it's the hardest thing in the world to get started
how old are you? I'm twenty seven
so you're still young still young getting older we all are but
it's not hard to stay if you keep working out when you're young though when you get older your body's not going to look as bad I seen an old woman today she was about eighty and she looked so good
she was standing just as straight and tall and she had a small waist and she didn't have you know how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle
she didn't have that at all her lips were a little bit wide but a lot of back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway
so she may be keeping that on purpose so I notice if you stay in shape you don't age as bad
I think too I go to school too at night and last semester I had stopped working out'cause I hurt myself and started smoking a lot and you just those kind of things age you more
smoking ages you quick an
it puts those little wrinkles around your lips an you can't and then it just kind of feeds itself you smoke and then you don't work out because you
you get winded and so
I smoke a pack a day an I finally quit because all I was doing was going down hill fast
I can't quit smoking I've tried I was telling a friend of mine that I'd be almost as bad as being an alcoholic
I can't quit smoking I've tried I just can't do it I quit when I was pregnant with my kids but as soon as I had them right back to it right back to them
it was that was the only reason I quit I didn't want to that's
and I don't want to quit smoking I enjoy that I said I have very few vices I'll keep this one thank you
but did you ever go to one of those health clubs or anything? I went to health club a few years ago and now I work out at home because my schedule with school and work I don't have time to get down to one
there used to be one that was a twenty four hour that I used to go to but I actually prefer to work out alone
I like to work out with people
I need like you I need competition is what I need
I've got to have somebody to compete with or I don't want to do anything I wouldn't mind working out with a friend and stuff but when you get into some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait
are you I like to start get it done and get out of there
are you married or anything? I'm not
get your girlfriend to work out with you a lot of women like that I'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him he doesn't work out very often course he don't need to he's small and he works as a laborer on the railroad
so he's building his muscles up all day he doesn't have to do anything
he can eat like a horse too and he don't gain it like I do but especially having a kid tends to just gain weight because you have to you have to
you can gain too much weight I gained a little bit too much but I looked with my first little boy I did gain a lot of weight I got about fifty pounds overweight with him and I didn't loose it until two years ago and then I got pregnant and ruined that so just have to start all over
actually like I say it ain't as bad this time because I was in shape when I got pregnant
I wasn't overweight when I got pregnant with him I just wasn't in shape I don't know the difference but some people are a little bit fanatical about it I
about weight? and about working out and fitness
exercise I like to work out to look good and stay in shape and I know it's good for me but people that live for it and eat a bunch of different pills and all that kind of stuff it gets a little bit obsessive
that's what my friend did
she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else and really we was even with her taking all those expensive vitamins and stuff we stayed right on the same track with each other developing and everything
there you can take those what is it? steroids
steroids I couldn't think there's really bad for you
I was trying to say hemorrhoids I was trying to say hormones hormones
hormones but steroids but I stay from that crap it's too dangerous
I could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something
I had a friend whose brother did steroids and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out it all turned to fat and he just really looked bad but
I didn't know it did that I don't know if it does to everybody he was just that's how it affected him and he just
but I've been wanting to get me a bike I've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around I'm scared to run for dogs course I know dogs can get you on a bike too but seems like it at least you got a chance to out run them that way
I don't like to run myself I've thought about it several times and I like to move a little faster and cover more ground
they they've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was I would think it would be hard on your legs and your joints and stuff
it's real hard on your legs and it's hard on women and it just makes stuff move down
but I like jogging I don't mind that I can get out and do that as long as it's not hot I can't
if it's hot you can't do that but I love to run in the rain just be careful not to slide
but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain can you you can't it's dangerous you slide at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires you slide all over the place
when I did ride my friend's bike that one time I don't know what I was trying to do I was trying to make a u turn and I never could make a u turn in a bike I can do it in my car but I tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked and I told her a dog was chasing me but I wrecked it into the curb I didn't hurt it too bad I scratched it on the she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire I think
but anyway it's been nice talking to you
and good luck with the new kid
thank you she's good anyway have fun exercising do you have kids?
I got three how about yourself? we have two and another one on the way
you have got young children then we do we have a six year old he is oldest and then our baby will be a year on monday that is great what kind of mix do you have? a boy and a girl? two boys two boys two boys
do you know what is on the way yet? are you I am just about three months and I don't think we really even want to find out I do not blame you we like surprises so we will take either
we have got two boys and a girl also we have got two boys and a girl and does it are the two boys first?
maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time maybe
we kind of like our boys though too so
our boys one he is in graduate school at a and m he is in the navy he is a lieutenant in the navy and the navy is sending him for his masters in ocean engineering
and we have got another boy that is out in maryland he is a wildlife biologist and our girl is thirteen she is in the seventh grade so we have got still all sorts of good activities since you kind of got a span there
what do you do with your seventh grader?
she is into a little bit of everything she loves riding horses so she goes out riding as much as she can do you have horses?
just she knows people that does
that but maybe that riding place that is north of town that she goes to she rides english and does jumping takes lesson and all that kind of stuff does she? she must really like them
she is into she plays the flute in the band and the piccolo and she is into this odyssey of the mind thing which takes a lot of time for it a what they call peace group I don't know if you have gotten into that with your kids but that is where the kind of it is a program for advanced kids advanced
I have heard about it our little boy is in the first grade and I taught school for six years
so I do know about that program and
my wife is involved and she kind of heads that up for these kids and last year they got the state level they did not win that but they got one local and one region and they got a new mix of kids this time so it keeps them busy
it keeps them busy I bet so does she go actually out into a different classroom with other kids that are involved in this?
but they have you probably know a peace group that they are advanced type that they are special classes for peace classes I think that this happens to be
history is what their peace class is this year so
she enjoys that kind of stuff and does well with it how neat so challenging
always something to do as far as our activities we are kind of on a different level here but my
you will get to different levels I guarantee it my husband is going to take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight they like to that will be fun both boy things
but we do not have any real we don't really ski we have not taken our kids skiing or anything of course the baby is young but
got to wait a couple years sledding that is what you have got to do tobogganing the what?
you have got to go tobogganing and sledding with them we have done that in fact he just goes right out here we have got quite a bit of snow last week we got a lot
you are welcome to keep that you would like that
I grew up in wisconsin I had plenty of snow and when I was a kid
and we have lived here about seventeen years but we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all of that kind of stuff it is fun really it is fun
as long as you do not have to drive in it I I do not like that
I really it makes me nervous
I had plenty of snow to last me forever I don't care if I ever see any I don't care if I ever see it but keep it off of here I don't mind it but the winter gets long
I get ready that come about this time of year I am kind of ready for it to start getting spring and it is too early yet
you have got five months before you will see that
we do we do we have had a few early springs though in the last few years they have not been too bad come about march it gets a lot nicer out oldest son when do you live in plano or work in plano or both? both both are you a t I er?
are you at work right now?
so am I in which building?
are you summit or are you spring creek? I'm spring creek
this is fun what building are you in? I'm building one
I'm building two at least we found something different that's I've never had a call not like that neither have I
isn't that funny? I usually get some place I got a woman in new jersey the last time I called I think that's funny
that is funny so so how's the weather in building two?
the weather in building two is cold it's been cold it's been cold in the building outside the building it's not bad typical t I listen I got me doing it typical texas spring are you a native to texas? I'm a transplant from? from california so what do you think of the texas weather? not as nice as california
how long have you been here? five years now
I've been here pretty long so
you know about august then I've been through five of those
there's no surprises left a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in august for if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go good idea
real good idea we went up to wyoming this last summer during that time and it was eighty degrees up there it was beautiful nice to get out of texas for a while
we went to alaska that's even farther away
that is really nice it is so cool you wear a jacket even in the summer time
or keep one handy because it rains a lot in alaska is that right?
it they call it their liquid gold
but it you get sunshine and it's lovely and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green and blooming green it's pretty texas isn't bad
not in the spring I have to think every year to try to remember what's it supposed to like this time of year
spring is nice because march we usually get a lot of rain in march it'll seem the news the harold taft on the local news
march we typically get a lot of rain and we've had this many inches and we're right on target and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in march but I
we always do though it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like
it I just wish it wouldn't come all at once
that's right and then we get all that heat and
it's just that when it rains it rains in california you get these nice lovely rains nothing really like downpours like you have here the other day we had some hail the biggest hail I've ever seen in texas I live in garland
you got into that bad stuff we got hail the size of marbles just so noisy hitting the house and the glass on the windows it didn't break anything but we went out there afterwards and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn
isn't that strange I know I you pick them up and they're perfectly round and I go how did they form so perfect like that
I think that's one of the strange strange things and you very seldom see it though I've seen hail but usually the size of tiny tiny pebbles really small but this was really large
so it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently is that correct? I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth I think that's
you don't think it's cold enough to
it's not on the ground but in the clouds it is must be
I guess and then I think all that falling would warm it up and melt it but maybe that's what rounds it but tumbling
I was dumb I was in florida for a week on business
and I had called back to the house I stayed the weekend and I called back to the house my housekeeper was baby sitting my cats and dogs said something to the effect of now we've made the national news don't get upset and don't worry it's in garland where all the bad weather is I said okay
and I watched the news and I thought that's garland that's not plano I don't have anything to worry about I was on the plane heading back to dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in garland felt so dumb
finally I got home and found out my property was okay
there was no problem with it but I guess you just tend to think of where your house is and nothing else
and close to that what's called duck creek that runs through part of garland that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's the hard rain
I see the creek overflows and a lot of houses around that creek seem to get flooded
the streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding
that house that I bought is close to a firewheel golf course
just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through that's where I live close to that
not quite I don't live in that firewheel division but I live close by there in far north garland
is that a nice area? they're supposed to it's getting built up with more new shopping centers and things it's a fairly new area and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by by ninety three or ninety four or something a brand new mall not too far away from that area so
the house that I bought was really really nice it'd be nice
in the firewheel estates there whatever
really really nice home very pretty but you're not living there right now
I'm going to lease it I see
it's investment property I see
but it's a very nice place I would cheerfully live there of course it's not my home and I've lived in my home almost ten years and I've got everything just exactly like I want it
but if I were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards it's a nice house that's a nice area is it on the golf course?
it's not it's off the golf course and I'll be honest with you I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is is that right
but it's in the estates that adjoin it that's a nice area
it is that really is a nice area when they get that highway finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick
that one ninety is just going to be the outermost loop around
another belt line just farther out
just continue to do that where are you from in california? southern california
san diego? I've lived in san diego for six years when I was younger and l a area and my parents live in anaheim right now lived up north of los angeles in thousand oaks area where the cowboys have their training camp or used to anyway
I've been through all of that
there is an area beyond thousand oaks north of los angeles that is really an eerie strange looking area with boulders
I they're not really hills they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation I'm not familiar with what is it along the coast or inland
it may be a little bit more inland
that is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen
I had to go up to t I on business a couple years ago out there
and we went up that coastline and I was just amazed how unusual that looks
hang on just a second I've got a los angeles map let me just quick they have some pretty nice weather out there in los angeles valley valley
I know where that is
beyond thousand oaks I know where valley is I've been out there before
you don't think that's strange looking I didn't notice anything strange about it
maybe I'm used to texas maybe texas the way
the elevation is extremely high
it's got curving roads on it but the it's just a strange landscape there's very little vegetation I don't remember seeing that part of it I know valley it's just a suburb of l a
it's a and they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately people can get in and out of l a easier
maybe it's a place I went to it was far extreme thought we'd never find the place
it was interesting because we went out the ventura highway to thousand oaks and on up through that way sounds interesting
I know exactly that area it's a nice area out there I love thousand oaks texas I don't know things you just have less a variety I guess I don't think it's quite as green it's green with all the trees and things out here but it's just
it's green sometime but it's just I don't know
it doesn't stay green
the really and in all honesty I know this sounds like a texas story all honesty you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years we haven't had a really bad one I missed that one of eighty or eighty two or eighty one that had the heat wave it may be eighty two because we bought our house in eighty one and we built a pool in eighty two I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling lots?
what do you do now? we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the boy scouts our boys have been involved in have had a huge recycling bin over at resurrection lutheran church
so we've done that for quite some time but since the price of paper has gone down it's about a fifth of what it used to be
so the boy scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over
now we just put ours out for the city of plano do you live in plano? I do
and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins
have you had yours now?
although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs
that's why I asked you I guess it does go in cycles
and not everyone got theirs right away
and I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because wal mart collected it
we used to take ours there and my garage was just getting overwhelmed I know
and of course I didn't go weekly so it became quite a big thing
and I'm really glad they do it I do mostly newspapers and plastic two liter diet coke bottles and aluminum cans some
but I don't use as many of those
I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that are really dirty that you have to wash out
I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two
so it was wasting a lot of time wasting all your time and effort and putting it in there
thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned
but it's not that hard now that I've got this system under control got your routine down
I guess there are some places in the north in particular that have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle because they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
so if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there
I do find that I don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are being tossed in with the recycling that's right
and I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than what are some of the things they don't recycle one thing I thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries supposedly leak and contaminate the landfills
and yet what am I going to do when I have a couple double a batteries to toss out and they don't take probably going to throw them in your trash
that's what happens because there are places that take car batteries but I wonder if they would take
not that it would kind of a pain to drive over somewhere special for two little tiny batteries but
but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something that's true
if they've got these bins for all the other little items I'm sure if people will have batteries quite often to toss out that's true
when I was home those few days around thanksgiving and the truck came by we all ran out to watch it because we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff
and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff
is that right? and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just scanned it I don't know what that was reading it for but
registering our garbage they must be trying to keep track of who is doing it or what I guess
I don't know another
wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year for those who are really cooperating
that would encourage it
except I know it would just not be cost effective they've already got all this money out on getting the trucks and hiring people to work them I'm sure they couldn't afford that but
but the garbage now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two
that's interesting also slightly off the subject but our big green garbage thing got stolen it did?
and we called the city and they brought us a new one and they did not charge us and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen isn't that sad it is sad and just
you know they paid for those things anyway and they must be really expensive
or our taxes do of course we were hoping we weren't going to have to pay for it
but what would somebody do with them
I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows
and they kind of are in different spectrums I think one of them is quantum leap
and the other one is night court and I think they're real different I don't think they have anything in common
quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way I guess but mostly it's kind of science fiction and it's adventure and things like that
and then night court is just pure weird fun it's nothing serious about it at all so I don't know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows
but that's the way it is so
it's funny that those are my husband's two favorite shows too
and I enjoy watching both of them but I used to didn't like night court
and I and the only reason I think I like it now is because I've seen it so much and I'm involved with the characters but I used to think dan fielding was just too vulgar and too crude for me he is
and I told my husband that's the whole point but that's right
I just it's I find him degrading at times I guess that is the point but sometimes it just they really have changed him though if you've watched it this season he still is in his own way degrading and everything but he's involved in that charity and it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some beautiful woman just because his mind was on the ozone layer and global warming and all this other kind of stuff
and he was too depressed to so that was part of his character building or whatever but
I think it probably adds a little bit of depth to his character I haven't watched which of course he needed
I think so which in quantum leap you get even though the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a real person in those situations he's doing amazing things
but he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do that's a good point
and I think that's I like that what do you consider your favorite shows?
I think my favorite show is hunter
and I like the old series better when dede was in there dede I agree
and then the blond that they took out the one that got killed I can't remember what her name is but is
I didn't enjoy her I she was too much of a opposite of dede and I think that's what they try to do but I think we wanted to see dede there or somebody like her
but I read an article in t v guide about hunter and about his three girls whatever you want to call them
and they say that there was a conflict between her and him that they never really could get her into any character that they could use
the second lady? the second one the blond
if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all
they didn't they were never partners
she would go her way and he would do his
and I think that's what I didn't like and even at the beginning dede and hunter would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would go this but it seemed like it was almost two different organizations
hunter was the boss and this other girl was not and you're wondering when did this happen?
so I kind of agree with that
and I like the new lady better but I'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there I'd just as soon have the police story without all the romance I'm afraid that's what they really wanted to do
I think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it
and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants I don't know but I like the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what I always enjoyed about it there was that spark between dede and hunter for a while
but they started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting show to where you never really knew which one was going to show up whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners
and that I kind of thought was good but it's you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't get together or whatever
and so I guess that's what they decide to do
just go ahead and quit the wondering
and but it's always been a formula for t v that the minute that the two main stars get married that the show ends up dying
a good example of this and this is maybe it's not a good example I've been watching nickelodeon all last week because they had what they called maximum smart they had get smart for ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night until five o'clock the next morning all the get smart episodes you could ever see
the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married
and that was the killer the series died right after that because
I was going to say I didn't ever watch moonlighting go ahead
but I heard that's what killed it same thing
that interplay died when they got married and so the show died the it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they get married
the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and of course another one of their mistakes is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the characters personalities especially after they get married halfway through
couple of examples would be like I said this one about get well smart the female character barbara feldon
she had been at the beginning the intelligent one the one who always solved the things and figured out and kept max from getting real messed up in short whenever they got married she got dingy
why would they do that? it made no sense
I'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows unfortunately that's probably true
which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which I don't enjoy because of that but do you watch who's the boss? that's on tuesday nights I think
I've seen it before but I don't watch it regularly I hardly ever watch it
usually tuesday nights I'm out so but as I've seen it they've done sort of the same thing to where they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart
and I think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them get together then you lose part of what the show's all about
so I always thought that was kind of weird
it's funny how we romanticize people
for instance where as the teenager you romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care any more or something like that and I think it's the same with your characters on t v do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret or at least they keep it quiet probably
I know it affected me when I was younger I'm not into rock stars too much lately
but like madonna and sean penn I don't particularly like either one of them
but their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together
or at least that's the way I look at it so I don't know
it would have been hard wouldn't it I would think so
I just the publicity in and of itself much less the when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place so having twenty million people watch you do that it's they wouldn't be easy
that's kind of interesting
I guess that's about all we need to do isn't it
I think we've covered our time
it's been good talking to you it has been becky I really appreciate it
you're the first man I've talked to everyone else has been a female so this is a change I think I've you're the second female I've talked to
you've had a little bit of variety it's kind of nice thanks so much
how do you feel about the immigration laws?
at currently I think they are a little restrictive particularly for certain ethnic groups or from certain countries I think we should permit more immigration from eastern europe for example particularly the jewish people from russia I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last several years and I think we have too much restriction on the orientals also but of course that's just my opinion I'm not real sure why I got this topic because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws
we seem to favor certain countries particularly south american countries and there is no I have nothing of course against the south americans or hispanics in that sense but I think we are more restrictive of the so called eastern european countries than we should be of course that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern europe so
so I think the embargo we placed on the russian jews although we spent years and years lobbying for their release and their ability to immigrate from russia as soon as that occurred we simply said that instead of the hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by two thirds so
I do not quite go along with that but that doesn't make a whole of lot sense
and I still think again kind of having within this century come from an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides
both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so I'm a little touchy every now and then about that my family is from europe from england and ireland and have been in this country for more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years
so I don't have any relatives several generations back that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all born here
so I don't have any real strong ties with the immigration laws I don't have any personal feelings about them and I haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are
I think in a way though I also have an opposite point of view which is although I believe we should permit constant immigration into this country primarily for economic reasons I think we should have some quotas
of course my family and I again that was my grandparents came over during the time when there were quotas so they had to wait in certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over
so but I think unrestricted immigration is not best I agree with that
I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted not only would the united states become more over populated awfully quickly it would bring in a lot of people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in other countries I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime
there's another aspect of this too they're also diminishing the health restrictions which I was not aware of that
there were some regulations over just recently where people with certain diseases can not be excluded from immigration age is one for example and recently tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country they dropped that also
so I think in some ways we are becoming a little too egalitarian in that sense but I think we should be a little more circumspect about it again my opinion think we've talked long enough? I think so
I've enjoyed talking to you
I have talked long enough thank you
the thing is that I since I'm in school I don't basically have a monthly budget because I'm living off my dad but the thing is that I have to keep it under control because for example it's like the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything everything is pretty rough but he controls that part but then whenever it's like once the semester starts I'm the one who has to control how much spending there is and the only thing that I basically spend my money on is just food so
what about tuition and rent? who takes care of that? the thing is that I live in a dorm
so what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts
and then the tuition is also the same thing so the thing is basically that I spend maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on groceries and that's about it but the thing also is that if you want to go out if you want to go to a restaurant or something then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars three times a week
you can't do that very often so it's for us it's I can spend that money but it's not what I want to spend it on
are you working anywhere while you are going to school?
because they don't allow me to work since I'm a foreign student
and so the government doesn't allow me to work
so all the money comes from home
so you got to make so how do you keep track of where you are in your monthly spending? the thing is that I basically know how much I have?
and so the thing is that I can tell I get all my money out of the teller
and besides one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call international where do you call to? argentina argentina?
and so the one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills
talk too long that's they want me to call down there every so often
I told my dad dad listen if you want to save money I won't call so often he goes we want to keep in touch so I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you
so you call him collect? because it is more expensive that way
what makes you think so? any basically the united states is the cheapest country to call out of
and because it's considered a luxury in other countries
you just call him direct and then since it's his money anyway
and you get the bill and send it to him? I got money to pay that too
so it's basically it's not too much money and it's not too little money so I won't have to rush a letter to him or something
because he really wants me to concentrate on my studies
what are you studying? I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering and what do you think you'll do with that? with those degrees?
I can work here up to a year and? and hopefully get a job after that
you want to get into some kind of manufacturing or what's the specialty that you're looking for? computer communications and data transmissions
so you want to find a data transmissions you're looking for long distance type stuff
anywhere from local area networks metropolitan area networks all that and so you have a family?
I have a wife and two children and and does your wife work?
she doesn't work she does it's kind of hard to say now days other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself
and she gets paid for that so she brings some money in
she is trying to start her own business where she does that full time alterations and sewing stuff for the public
and do that on a full time basis here in town and you have a monthly budget?
sort of we're probably like most american families I guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month
and we know what bills have to be paid and we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with the monthly budget so you don't have any problem in overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that
we're like everybody else we've got several credit cards that sometimes instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time
that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff then that's one of the points which I don't see I don't give a lot of gifts during christmas and I don't like to give any at all
because the thing is that it's like if I want something I'll ask somebody
for christmas my roommate goes what do you want and I said I want a backpack
I told him if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a backpack
that's something that you can use because I needed a backpack so he gave me a backpack and I knew he needed an alarm clock
so I bought him an alarm clock so the thing was that that's great utilitarian but
necessary things no frivolous gifts but the thing is especially remember when I was down in argentina to me it was ridiculous because you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you don't care about it's like
that's true why bother
but the thing is that
especially being a college student your I don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving
that effects the budget especially around christmas time at the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect
what about when you have breaks christmas or between sessions? for example we had spring break now and I went skiing and I spent around maybe two hundred dollars
I expect so but it's
you've got to budget that though you've got to save up in able to do that?
because it's like we were saying let's go eat out before spring break I go let's not go eat out before spring break let's see how much money we have afterwards
and if I felt like I spent way to much then I won't go out
and so my roommate went home I went skiing over the carolina mountains which aren't anything
but I guess it was worth it
sure it is any time you can get away and get away from the daily grind it was a nice place
especially if you live on campus and you don't have a car you just go crazy
I know the feeling so let's see how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half is that okay? nice talking to you
nice talking to you have a good time what do you think about it?
I feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that I think there are some occupations such as the health field the transportation field they're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth they do it to prisoners
so I feel like it should be mandatory in some professions and I think if an employer feels that he wants to drug test employees and they don't like it then they should not be employed there that was I would not mind it I especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else harm or injury absolutely
and I don't have a problem at all with employers testing in the hiring process but I don't have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact but I do a little bit where it wouldn't hurt anybody I don't know sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far but
unless an employer has a reason to believe that the work competency of the employee is hurting the business
maybe it's and then it's not a problem
number one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft
and as an employer I would think that would be and the first it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost
there's no way but my concern is school bus drivers the train drivers
I'm not even I'm in education I'm not even opposed to it for that I'm concerned in the medical field
I think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because I consider that a drug I wish they would
I wish they would and that is even probably more widely abused by the masses than drugs so to speak
but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or a train I know and
and it doesn't take that long they don't have to be totally roaring drunk
just a little off on their timing could mean life just and
t I has the random testing policy
and our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a pool
so I've already been tested once when I was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program
but I work with one girl who was tested her name got randomly selected three times in six months
and I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it when there's no reason to suspect someone
control that's getting a little bit that's enough to make anybody paranoid
as long as you accept that it is a random testing to alleviate
that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me
if it's almost like being selected for jury duty
so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel that's just the way it is either just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it
I would rather have it that way than to think that somebody turned me in because I think when you let other employees turn in people
there are so many people with their petty axes to grind
it could really get out of hand
so I would really rather know however there's got to be some backup to say that if somebody does observe you at a party using drugs I would think that it would be their obligation to report that
to report it and I guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something because I would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol personnel or something
I'd feel really uncomfortable
I don't know what kind of work you do but there would even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way we have a lot of people who work on the line I'm in accounting so it wouldn't they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something
but out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment
it's especially given today the drug abuse that goes on I just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at risk because they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits the insurance claims et cetera put at risk I agree totally
and I'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse and in the long run we're all paying for that
so it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that
I was trying to remember there was a court case here where I live just a few months ago the city workers they wanted to the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing
and the city workers took them to court to protest saying that it invaded the search and seizure amendment
and it's still tied up in the legal channels they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not
so I'm curious especially since a local employer is also already doing it seeing what they'll say about it especially since to see how that's
is it just a small group of the employees that are concerned? it's the whole city seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it
they just don't want to be drug tested so
my husband and I have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested
my husband's retired from I r s agents
however this isn't a problem that we have either alcohol or drug
and so in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal that's the way I looked at it if I had something to hide it's one thing but I'm you know you don't so it's not as big a deal and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned about their rights or whether they're really concerned about something else
and then they say if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right away from you but I I don't believe that
I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything and of course one of the big deals now too is that when you come into a company you sign a paper saying that I will go take a
I do not know how big a city is rome? you have heard about dallas and the crime here is pretty bad rome is pretty small but
I was going to say we hear a lot about new york city
there is a lot of crime down there and I am afraid to go down there because you hear about people getting mugged you leave your car for ten minutes and it is stripped when you come back
have you ever been there? I have not only to the airport
that is probably enough to see
are you in college right now? I work for the air force
so there is a base up here and
are base that's interesting concept are bases safe? bases are pretty safe because they check your I d on your way in and
they minimize the access but even so we had a at new years we had some people come in and attack one of the planes because they were protesting the presence over in the persian gulf that is wonderful
dallas we lived in minneapolis we moved here about ten months ago and dallas is pretty we live in north dallas which is near a suburb called plano so we are out of the city but it is bad everywhere in terms of the handgun situation the number of rapes the number of muggings just I would not say it is not as bad as new york but it is pretty scary
people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods and
they call them ornamental grates but they are still bars that makes it bad for getting out during a fire
it really does and if you are a little bit claustrophobic but I do not know the jails are crowded I am not a criminal justice specialist so I do not know what can be done I am I do not know
it seems to I think it is getting worse because I keep hearing things when I went home my parents live in boston
but I went home and we were watching t v
and this thing came on where a group of five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and robbing them
and it was really disgusting and my mom was they should just be all shot right now and you
were they teenagers or?
like that girl in new york that got beat up when she was jogging in central park a couple of years ago?
I think they were early twenties they were young men
so they weren't and were they obviously poor or depri ? that is really like I say I know it how deprived could they be if they had a camcorder? those are a thousand bucks
unless they stole it and that is one big thing down here they have and they are not all young they are eighteen to twenty four some of the young men and women but you can see the crime stoppers ads on television and they are sometimes it is the same people that have been observed and they still can't catch them
and you are wondering how we lived in minneapolis and wisconsin there was all kind of I know it is getting worse I do not know what the world is or is not the in a small town in wisconsin near madison a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun and killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters
and the child had and they said that he was twelve years old and he had not displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever
and you are thinking to yourself I wonder where
I know I do not know I wonder where he gets it? you must I think t v is bad because they show all sorts of violence on
that and I do not think a lot of parents I do not know how it is in the air force base but I just do not think a lot of people both need to work I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more they do not talk to their kids and take them out and are not there all the time
so the kids are off to their own devices a lot
and discipline I do not know how your folks were but I sure knew as heck when I was growing up that my parents were the superior and I was the subordinate and it was sort of like there were boundaries
and I do not know I think today a lot of parents are ruled by their kids I I think so definitely when you go to a restaurant and kids are running all over the place they
they are not learning boundaries I see it in work place too sometimes I do not know how old you are but you sound a little bit younger than me but I am in my thirties and I see even people that work with me that are ten years younger that they kind of have an attitude that I hate to say it but that's just what it is it is an attitude like the world owes them something but they
I see that too in the air force
do you? a lot of especially since a lot of us are engineers where I work
are you in the air force? I am in the air force
and so people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do
and so all the young engineers are I am just going
get it for all it is worth and that
and I am you are the one who signed up if you did not want to do it and
and the air force is one of the better military experiences it is I like it a lot pardon me? I like it so far
that is are you going to be a career person? I'm digressing but I do not talk to many people in the military
so I am probably not but they pay for my college so
that is the way to do it and that's at least the air force is I do not know I am nervous in dallas I go to an aerobics class or something and seventy women in a jazzercise class in a public parks and rec building and you are supposed to feel safe but then there are all these it does not matter race but it is an inter racial mix and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards
and I do not even think that way but you just nobody can think that it can't happen to them it
no matter who they are or where they are at and you never know who is watching either
did you I do not know I was in the grocery store this morning we went to new orleans for four days and came back late last night driving and it is about seven hours
and that is a very we had never been there that is a very very neat town to visit in terms of the french quarter and all of the things you hear about
but the crime is so bad there in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do how to carry your wallet this is new orleans?
new orleans I would hate to be there during mardi gras let me tell
I would never you just do not do not even bother it is not worth it when we came back I do not know if you have seen I was in the super market this morning and on the cover of time magazine there is a girl she is in boston? she is on the east coast somewhere real attractive young girl college freshman college coed I think she is a freshman she had been dating a fellow for several weeks
they went back to her dorm room
and date rape and it just she looked anguished it was really just sad did not pick it up and read it but I should have but I just looked at the picture and thought what a world I know
I do not you can't trust anybody
I do not have any cure it is really scary
you really can't we lease out a really nice two story town home in north dallas and they have a real big thing here even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting everybody wants your business kind of thing
and my husband is the kind of guy he's sometime he was raised on a farm in southern ohio near dayton and I think sometimes it is just he and I are very different in terms of that I basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts we
and he opened the door I came downstairs and I was real upset and I probably got more nasty than I should have but I just said howard
I would not you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away or people
and it is not a reason I have been to new york you should not deny yourself going to visit and all that
but it is not any worse I used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by are you from boston?
home owners savings and loan in boston
and I know I never felt I have been to downtown new york city and I have been to downtown boston and I never felt any safer on milk street in boston staying at the meridian
I did not pay for but I never felt any safer there than I did in any other city I have been in
so I would say one thing do not deny yourself the new york experience but go with people that you know I would not want to go by myself
but I do not know I guess I could go on and on about what to do about criminals I think the handgun I am not real big on guns myself
so I think our justice system needs to be stricter because they do it
and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like they are booked up
are the new york I do not know how the new york state prison system is
but are they booked up?
that is a way to put it they are booked up are they paroling murderers and here it is just a real big deal they parole people that have killed police officers and then they are out doing it again I do not know because I am not real up on a lot of news things
but you just hear about that
it is a lot of repeat crime and you are why are they repeating? they should have been in there longer or
I know and then you think I can remember I have not been out of school that long but it has been at least ten years and you think to yourself was it that bad back then? or is it just I think that like you said television? is it just that more people think there is excitement in it? people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something it seems that it is more in boston there was a case of a couple of kids fifteen year olds they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone
so they picked on this kid who was new in town
and they were no one was going to miss him anyway and it
that is horrible how can you even think like that?
isn't it something? I am originally from pittsburgh pennsylvania and I have a niece and nephew and I just my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that I am just going michael how did you hear about that?
it is just I think kids get too much too fast and all those sort of things
in atlanta where my inlaws live they had that thing the high top sneakers the air jordans et cetera
kids killing each other and beating their brains out for the sneakers
or the jackets the team the raiders and the caps
stealing the hundred dollar jackets it goes from the most petty like that to what you were saying that they in boston that is crime where they videoed that is probably one of the most bizarre I have heard of
where they videotape themselves it seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of be
we've talked a little bit about the plano school system I really have been pleased with plano I have a child who my son is learning disabled
and I thank god every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into
is he the elementary school? he's in elementary school
and he's not severely learning disabled he's being helped
but he is being helped he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math
and they recently released him from resource which I was thrilled
I really was I just thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump and he's in the herman method of reading I don't know if you're familiar with that
that's something new to me I'm it is something new and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters I think I read about that in the paper it's wonderful
doctor haggard is heading that up and it's wonderful he didn't have a problem with reading as a matter of fact he's reading on level the problem was his spelling and in watching the way he has struggled
it's interesting because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability that was ignored and
so you learned how to solve your problems on your own that's right and so it's not an intelligence problem it's just a problem with learning
has he had this since kindergarten or is this something that maybe learning phonetics and then he just didn't learn the right way? it's funny when he was in first grade he had trouble with spelling
and I would say to the teacher it's amazing he will be able to you'll say to him spell cat and he'll say c a t and then he would go to write it and he would write c o t
and I kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here something is wrong here
you're right and the teacher kept saying he has a may birthday he's just immature
second grade it was I will these teachers as far as I'm concerned are absolute saints because in second grade I went up there and I requested a conference because all year long they kept telling me I was crazy
that's great for parents to be involved I was and I went up there the second week of school and I said something is wrong and the head teacher the team leader was a special education major
how great it was and she had picked it up
so she was able to zero in
she had already picked it up and she said we were going to call you if you hadn't called us we think there's a learning disability and we think he needs to be tested immediately because once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested
and she said I think we can get him real fast
and sure enough they tested him and he qualified for the help and it's been great and I thank god I'm here because I know I have a sister who has the other extreme she has a child in connecticut who is extremely gifted and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her
and to me that's the same thing it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored this poor gifted child is being ignored
but that's something that parents are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child that's true
because that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home that's true
but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult
and this to me is the benefit I see in public schools is that you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs that these students need and I'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them
and they don't take them and if they're a behavior problem they're out that's right
that and this is kind of a rejection type of thing
and we get it even at our level in I work a nine ten school and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the parochial and private schools
and they come in and their attitude is I'm a bad boy' and proceed to prove it
so I really hate that for them I would rather they not have that attitude
but that's when comparing test scores recently I was in a discussion and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools
and that was one of the points that I made is that you're not comparing apples to apples
that's right you can't say I know steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability into a private school which is too bad
but on the other hand I can't necessarily blame them they are a private school
and they can do whatever they want that's right
they can be selective and they that's right they have the ability to be selective but you can't say then public schools are not as good
perhaps they are because they're
if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the private school group then I think you would have a more equitable way you're right
and I have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here in honesty the kids in japan they have to try out to even get to which kindergarten they're going to get into
and then after and if you only in fact they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and high school
and if they don't when they reach a certain age that's the end of their schooling
and they don't ever really go on it's only their top ones that go on like ours do
so that creates a problem and you can't compare because they go so many more hours
the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education and is that child
you see that with the foreigners that come here
that's right I was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they said that these children they had to be the best and they put off all social life all everything
that's right that's right is that good? the child is very bright but on the other hand I feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road are more rounded better coping skills
I think it's real important to have friends I think it's real important to play sports I think it's real important to be part of a team
and so that's why I said their childhood is extremely different from mine we didn't do all that
we certainly didn't carpool and run the way I do
and you don't see the parents encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band
it's strictly stick to the educational and it's interesting to see them as they get older then that is the type of adult they are do you see anything wrong with public school systems?
I do I think I'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to deal with in some quality way I think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job I agree
do you? do you have children in the public school system? and I taught for fourteen years before we moved to texas
is that right and the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms for all the children you were a bookkeeper
everything had to be documented and I had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation
I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back and I'm just really in a dilemma if that's what I love to work with children and to teach them me too
but I'm really having questions if I can deal with that system and have a good conscience about what I do I don't think it's the teachers I think it's the system I think so too
but they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency
and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried who's looking over her shoulder and what child's going to say something some parent's going to overreact to that's right I know
that's true it's hard on the children too because the teachers are overworked and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best that's right do you have children in the system?
I have two I have in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade and them I'm home schooling my kindergartner this year
we live in a district that has open classrooms and I wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her are you in plano? I am too
you too and I have one in ninth grade at clark and one at hendrick this year and my sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews and the very first year I taught back in seventy three we had open classroom and it didn't work then
and when we moved down here I was just appalled that they were still doing it here still at it
the explanation I was given about they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with some kind of partitions partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something
just I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school
so he spent all day in this one large open area
so I didn't really care for that it seems like the schools in michigan were much better than they are down here were they? that was our last tour in michigan
we were from north carolina and of course north carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education I think they rank about forty ninth
but our children got a very good education there
they were in the magnet school program from the time they were about third grade they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes
and it was wonderful
so I'm coming to plano thinking it's going to be really great it's ranked so much better that's right we heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system
isn't that interesting I don't understand how they get this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money I don't know probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are I guess so
my son is at clark this year too so we're as a freshman?
and he's pleased with his classes I don't guess I've been in the high school long enough to know what to expect really how to judge it
my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and I ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect for a freshman to have that's good
she's not bogged down but yet she has some every night
eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any so that's interesting but his grades I haven't seen them yet but supposedly they're good you always hear how good my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home that's right
my name's gail I'm calling from texas
I'm sandy I'm in texas too what a deal took long enough to find you
seems like they take forever any more did you hear what the topic was did she tell you
if you're ready then I'll just go ahead and start
hold on I guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women
seems like to me everything is just changing so much that it's almost like you can't keep up with things any more and everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women personally I'm a stay home mom and I like it the way it used to be so am I are you
I think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you I mean that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before but I guess more than anything I think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do
I don't know I think sometimes some of the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all and you can't have everything
there's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be and to me that's more important how many kids do you have? two two? are they young or
five and two five and two I have two and mine are two and nine months so being home is real I just am fortunate because I don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home and it's just weird that I was just talking to somebody this morning who's a working mom and these people have secretaries and these high power jobs and it just seems like she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care and I just don't agree with that I think it should be that people should get back to staying home and being more family oriented than not it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other and I hope it just doesn't get to where there's more and more women going into the work force
I agree but I hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you should stay home otherwise your children aren't going to turn out or whatever because that's not fair to the single moms that have to work
or if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever
I think it's got to be a personal choice and it's nice that we could have the choice to stay home I find that whenever I'm in a group of people and we're discussing things just over the weekend I visited my family and some cousins I hadn't seen in a long time and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing and I had my baby with me and I found that all I talked about was my baby which was fine with me
but it's like here these people are they're going to school getting degrees making all this money and they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages because I didn't have really all that much to talk about where career and things like that were concerned and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes
which is too bad because obviously I don't get paid for my job but I should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home
that's what I figure I'm worth a lot just for what I do every day but I don't know this is kind of a at least here I've noticed I'm not from here I'm from colorado but I've really noticed that there are a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home at least in the circles I've travelled and in the church that I go to that men don't treat you like you don't know anything generally speaking
and I think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as job sharing or even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff and I think that's really important that they do that
and they realize there's a need for that and I don't know I found when I did do some work when my son was young it was contract work and it wasn't where I had to be there every day but we were going to the doctor once a week so I don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem real excited when I heard this so far I've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so football I love this
this is great we're from colorado so we're bronco fans and we just moved here two years ago and they went to the superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again that was pretty pitiful but they seem to be doing pretty good this year
I was from illinois originally and I grew up a bear fan and then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became cowboy fans and we had some wonderful wonderful years there under roger staubach
and we kind of got spoiled
we expected it to continue forever I think they're doing pretty well this year though have they just lost one game this year? I think two two
I know they lost to washington and philadelphia but they're not doing bad people are pretty surprised that they beat the giants
and wasn't that fun I went to the balloon festival in plano and carried my little portable radio with me and I must say I attracted a lot of attention I bet
people running up saying what's the score what's the score? I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
that's right and that's exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television
but I wasn't I had forgotten or I probably wouldn't have been there I'm a big football fan I never my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just hated it and I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on sundays
so when I met my husband he was watching football and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend I couldn't see him until tuesday because monday night football if I didn't like football so
that's exactly where both of the wives came from I think
it was it's easier to join them than fight them
and if you want to see them you might just as well enjoy football
and I used to tease my husband sometimes and say did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games
I do I love it I just think it's such a fun sport and I'm just hoping that the broncos can get back on their feet we're not convinced that we're going to be cowboy fans yet but
it takes a little brainwashing first I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here
that's even harder but
are you transit usually? do you stay not in one place too long? we're just this is only the second place we've lived we've only been married for five and a half years and we have two small children and he just got transferred here to e systems so
it will take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for denver
I tell you this the weather here and there's no mountains or anything and when you go to a football game in colorado there's snow and it's an adventure and here you've just got to drive down to the stadium I know and
if they close it in we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing
but dan reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway he's from here that's right so
he was one of our boys that's what I hear
so we never cheer against denver unless they're playing the cowboys which is rare
which is good but I it's funny in colorado when the broncos went to the superbowl three times in the last five or six years they have these songs on the radio they take popular songs and change them to fit the broncos and stuff
and they had I was just thinking about one the other day if I saw a picture of john elway in the cafeteria at school but they did the johnny angel they did johnny elway to that
johnny elway and I was trying to get my son to sing that my husband was just having a fit don't have him sing that song but they do a lot of fun things I think football is kind of a sport that I think it's hard not to like it because there's just
there is so much about it to like it's exciting it's so exciting
and when the cowboys won the superbowl here of course they put together some real cute songs and we all ran out and bought the records and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item they I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in colorado because I think about that a lot but when I first moved here they did this this interstate seventy five song or whatever it was about central expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety five and everything
that was kind of a funny song but they sure do it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here even when they were losing pitifully people still support them we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs we love the diana
have you all been able to do much as a family these days?
pardon me have you all been able to do much as a full family these days all of you
we've gone all kinds of places we go out to dinner
we take the kids to the park and whenever my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we do everything we can possibly as a family do you work outside the home?
I don't I don't either it makes it a little bit easier that way
it does an then my husband enjoys spending time with the kids he'll take them out just to be with them
so they can have time with him so you have a break too
and we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home we try to spend monday nights and have little lessons with them and just see how things are going in our family and teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them
and we just do all kinds of fun things like that an we have family that's far away it sounds like you might too
we do so the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures
and and phone calls that's about it
and we go to the park or we go in the backyard and sit down an that's what we mostly do pretty simple things
especially since my youngest one is only fourteen months
she's really getting to the age where she's playing and likes to go places
and with me being at home and just having the one income you don't have this lot of extra money to do a lot of extra things that's right
so you make more fun than the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or or go get a bag of m and m's or something like that that's a big thrill for them
they think that's a lot of fun so we try to spend as much time as we can we our whole weekends are devoted to our children except for we might go out one evening or something
but during the day it's all devoted to our kids and they go to church with us and so that's true
so have you ever been to the science place?
that's what we haven't lived here too long and we went there a couple of weeks ago and
the kids thought that was wonderful we I guess there's science place one and science place two we've only been in science place two
I'm not sure which one we went into it was about a year or so ago when we went the one we went in had the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a kid's place area
they really seemed to go wild in there
they had a lot of fun in there and there's some petting I think it's owens country farms has a free petting a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet animals and stuff where's that
that's on plano road it's in richardson you go up plano road it's a little bit past campbell and plano road
and that's a lot of fun
they have tours going through there and the kids think that was a lot of fun too that does sound like fun it's a little bit of a ways
whenever we take them to showbiz or they think it's wonderful just to go to mcdonald's they don't go for the food they go to play around and there's another place in mesquite called monkey business that's right and it's a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for kids that's sounds fun too
and parents get in free and during the week it's five dollars admission per child all day and you said about plano and campbell is the petting
the petting farm that sounds fun I think maybe we'll try to do that
and the one in mesquite is scyene exit
and it's the kids just had a wonderful time there you just pay that admission and then all the rides are free of course they have all the little video games and those little quarter rides to and stuff like that but they thought that was lot of fun
you can have birthday parties there an I think that was better than showbiz pizza cause there's more for them to do because they can just do you don't have to have tokens for everything
so they had a lot of fun that does sound like fun I've gotten some good ideas from you
we try to do a lot of things as a family and inexpensively as possible so I think I don't know if we've done five minutes but I'm sure that will be good
that will be good it was good talking to you
it was good talking to you I really appreciate your suggestions
no problem take care
where do you enjoy dining out?
I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap do you have children?
we have four but most of them are gone now
so there might be but we were taking four five and six people out that makes a difference doesn't it
what area of the country do you live in?
I'm in texas I am too but
and we lived in ohio prior to this I did too I'm from the dayton area
we were up near cleveland
but I look for service even at the quickie places type things
I don't like to go to the drive thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong that's right
and then you're stuck and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave
so I really don't like the drive thrus that much I like to go and eat there but I would say service atmosphere and whether the food is good and on going out I like steaks so we try to hit those places when we can when we travel we look for wendy's because we have kids and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals
and then that way they can get their burgers and fries and we can have a salad bar
so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a wendy's because it's all either mcdonald's or dairy queens
and in the countries unless it's a large city I guess dairy queen and wal mart are their main that's right
that's what you find I know
my husband likes dairy queens he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs I guess
so he's a fan of dairy queen and we'll go even in town here at times just as a change although I'm not that excited about it
but we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place but yet I hate to cook food at home
so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe
or we eat junk food at home
my what are some of your favorite inexpensive places?
we'll go to them all we sort of take turns and we I sort of favor the ones if I have a coupon we can go there and if not we can't because it's cheaper
so mine is strongly monetarily based we'll go get pizza at little caesar's although the kids prefer domino's we are little caesar fans here
that's where we always go
but it's just a lot cheaper than domino's so that's we go to grandy's quite a bit I would say we like grandy's too
mcdonald's we've sort of been off of that for a while and no particular reason and I maybe we avoided wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there and she never wanted us to show up there
so we don't go there that much where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out or a big meal?
a nice meal where do you go for steaks?
it's usually when we're out of town
and I'll order steak or steak and lobster combined
so it's really not in town you ever been to houston's on belt line?
that's where we go to get steaks
they have a teriyaki steak there and when we have something to celebrate we head to houston's they don't take reservations and you wind up waiting about an hour
but the food is good and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five o'clock then you can go right through
but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks so that's our nice place to go we don't usually take the kids when we go there
but we don't go out that much I guess we do go out without kids we're usually picking things up quickly though we just don't dwell on food too much
and with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places that's right
so it doesn't really matter to him he'd probably just like to stay home that's the way with my husband he's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends and I've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend
I think I never have liked to cook food but I think it all began eating out when we had the boys on baseball
it was mainly baseball teams
and my husband would coach so we were never home at the same time
I'm not one that's going to fix the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there
if they're not there in between five and six then I guess we don't eat today or you fend for yourself
you go somewhere else so that really snowballed when we got down here when I started to sub make money I went I'll just sub to back by that
the there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of how women have changed
look at them in england margaret thatcher was prime minister indira ghandi in india
so many women are heads of state and we keep saying we feel some day a woman will be president but I have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that I think we'll have a black president before we have a women president
and I don't know whether that's bad or good it's just a point that I have observed that we I I truly believe that before that we have to address the racial issues in the united states before we can go anywhere
because it's a friend of mine traveled to balise and into honduras
I think we're supposed to hang up it wasn't the matter of wealth it was the matter that they were not wealthy that made them equal
I'll talk to you later thank you
what do you know about latin american policies?
I think they're kind of ambivalent really I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations
are you relating this to the affair we've got going on in haiti right now?
half the time we don't know who to support
that and maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with countries like that that depend on us so much without running their country for them but that's just it
it's got to be tough but you still have to let them know how you feel I guess my concern no matter which side we take we're going to have supporters and we're going to have antisupporters I guess for lack of better term and like you said they're such small countries that we're bound to upset somebody but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance
it worries me that the economy of so many countries in south america and central america depend on something that damages people like cocaine from columbia
and of course I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us
but that's a tough deal that's true
and it I don't think that maybe it's I'm reflecting how I feel about it but I have a feeling that we really don't understand basically the competing factions in lot of those countries and they've been hammering for the last ten centuries
and it's still going on and we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how some times
that's about the lump sum of it I was speaking with a woman from the honduras or guatemala or somewhere in there she was from el salvador
and she was from a relatively wealthy family and when the contras came into power of course with what's his face he's in florida jail now marcos
marcos is philippines
I'm blank on it you know who I'm talking about
I can see his face forget his name I know it when he came into power he basically just took everybody's property just assigned it to himself
kind of nationalized it for himself
so she's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the u s government in that respect and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance because they were a democracy turned dictator
basically a dictator fascist
and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing it just unstable
what do you think of this u s free trade agreement we're working on with mexico?
I think it's long overdue
I just there's so much difference in the economies of the two countries I have a problem with whether it's going to work or not it seems like there's and I this may be unfair to mexico but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in foreign policy a lot of the times mexico the mexican government is trying and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to make themselves americanized which is great because that's what they basically need to do
the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule
and we don't have the siesta
and the cultural differences it's what's really hurting the mexican people because they've had their way of life and we've had our way of life and
I think their version of the good old boy network going that has a lot
how is the weather out there?
it's really cold and supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had
you have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff how about you guys? it's about same the usual I think
nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff it's good
the weather let's see the snow here is different from utah's because I have lived in utah for like ten years what part?
and provo I was going to b y u
and the snow is really cold it's really humid so it seems wetter or something like that it's it's more humid in utah than there? or there?
it's more humid in iowa than utah
and it seems like when the winds blow it goes right through you it's really different from utah's weather I thought utah was cold but I think iowa is a lot colder that's how it is in texas too because when it's cold it's really cold so
I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind what's that?
I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind so the humidity is what does it
I think that's true because I noticed when I got here too because I'd when it would snow in texas we'd be really cold
and we'd have to get really warm and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing and you don't feel super cold
that's true it was weird
so how long ago did you graduate? or did you or
I graduated in nineteen eighty seven
my husband got his doctorate at b y u so that's and so he just graduated this past year so you just barely moved away?
we really miss utah do you like it out there? we miss the mountains you do?
because it's really flat here not flat but hilly but no big mountains or anything so you just moved away a year ago?
in august really recent
but what else can I say about the weather today was warmer it was forty five warm
so what's the temperature today over there? it's probably fifty fifty five maybe
maybe not that warm probably about it's not that cold really
and whenever I remembered the weather reports in utah I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill
but they talk about wind chill here all the time that's a big deal in texas too
they said it could be like six degrees out and negative forty one wind chill
so that's what we're not used to that's true that makes a big difference
so I so did you used to ski when you were out here? what's that? did you used to ski when you were in utah?
I've only skied in utah once I only skied once my whole life
but do you do a lot of skiing there? not tons but I like to when I get a chance
I've only been once so far but had the opportunity a couple times since then just saving my money for christmas things and that
so is this your first year in utah? this is actually my third year
and you're going to school there?
at u of u or at b y u
but I'll be here a long time at this rate
what's your major? it was nursing but I'm in the process of changing it right now
because it's really really competitive at b y u
you have to have a three seven to get in so it's really that's true I'm going to look into some other fields I'd like all the science classes and that I'm just not really enjoying too much so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school so
that's a good idea did you graduate in a certain field or
education I got a double major in
elementary and special ed
that what my sister did
you might know her here name is lori bird maybe not I think she graduated around then too though eighty seven probably but she got her
I can't there are so many girls in all my classes I can't remember how many people
because they since stopped that program where you can get it double pretty easily have they? it's really where are you from tina?
I'm from maryland and I have one son who's almost sixteen months old are you married or
you are I have two children I have a seven year old and a three year old
so I try to spend as much time as possible with them
that's good what kind of things do you do? we do a lot of things with them taylor my youngest is or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that
was it a big change in your life to have a child
it's really nice my husband is working most of the time he's working long hours but I'm staying home
I'm just working a couple days a month and what do you do during those days?
we spend a lot of time at the playground and we go to the zoo and we go and we you said you worked a couple days a month though what do you do?
I'm a nurse are you?
it's real easy to work out my schedule to still stay in with that and to have enough time to spend with matthew
he's just now really starting to get interested in a lot of things I understand that they really grow up quick especially at that early age
but my wife was she worked part time when my oldest was little and now she's staying home all the time but that worked out really well because it's a big transition to have children
to go from nothing if you want to do something every night that's fine but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore
that's right and I think a lot of people are realizing that but still there are so many people that have their careers first and I think it's really hurting the kids
but I agree with you I think that my wife leaned that way and I'm really glad she did and I'm glad she's staying home but I know there are some days when she wishes she was back at work I know
that's why I like to work a couple days I think it gives me a break
that's why I'm glad my wife did too cause she worked either two to three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she'd get to spend three or four days with
most of the time at home and
we had started out like that and I think that was really ideal I do to I agree but then when you start having two of them it's a little bit tougher because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff it's
it's difficult but are you from the maryland area?
I've lived here forever
I live in germantown and where are you from? I'm in dallas texas
in dallas I've lived here eight years or so my wife's from fort worth
but I work for texas instruments
so that explains that explains it doesn't it
I don't know we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family
but as far as during the week it's usually just my son and I and we're what's your husband do?
he works for coca cola
he manages a plant out here
and it takes a lot of time I'm sure it does
but it we take walks and go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that
but what my wife did some teaching at a private tutoring place a sylvan learning center this year
and so that got me to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff'cause normally if they need something they just go to mom no matter what it is
I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them but it's so much easier to go to mom
I guess they get used to it
but we'd go to the library and do things like that but
that's good that's good I know my husband was real in the beginning when he was transferred to a larger plant and he works about an hour and a half away from our home
so it takes him a little bit of time
and I'm not able to work during the week because of that I was working in the evening
and he was coming home and I could go to work but their relationship when I was able to work in the evenings really grew
he just the time that they were spending together
I think it really helped to have that time together it really does because I think you grow closer was your husband naturally a child had he been around children or
he has seven other brothers and sisters
and we have thirteen grand his parents have thirteen grandchildren
so there's a lot of kids in the family and he really enjoys it
but right now it's kind of a difficult time but
and the cost of living here is just so tremendously outrageous
it's difficult to do it any other way I understand
I it's hard because then you're not getting to spend as much time at home your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to
that's right that's a tough situation but then again some you got to do what you got to do to get along too
at least I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home it like I said my wife normally feels that way there are days when I come home and she says take these kids I'm getting out
I know so she's had about enough during those days but for the most part I've really feel like that's led
I know the way that like what you said with the cost of living and everything I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary and won't
and so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially
it has and I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that we need to do something about but I don't know what
I believe that too and I think the kids are where they need to
they need to really focus on the children in this country would you have said that a couple of years ago?
I didn't even really think about it that much
I was vaguely aware of it but it wasn't really that important to me and it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child
it really does I just the whole seeing how you really are forming the mind
in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where he'll mimic something that you've done and everything I'm doing he's learning from
that's right and you think if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby sitter or from a day care
that's how they're developing their patterns and I think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it that's
or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide
I've seen a lot of people just say he'll learn everything when he gets into eventually it's true
but it I know even just this first year that I've been with my son here he's I can just see how much of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of
plus I think it becomes part of you too you get to stay home it's not just for him but it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too I think
that's true it's been nice talking to you
it's nice talking to you too good luck
how do you feel about capital punishment?
it's I am pretty much against it
how about you? I'm pretty much for it
we can have a debate we'll have some interesting discussion I guess
I don't know I think that I one of the reasons that I'm against it is that I'm afraid of someone losing their life wrongly wrongfully
and another reason one of the arguments that I really actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really made me feel kind of strongly against it is that someone said to me once imagine if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldn't you want to see them killed for the punishment?
but then I thought about it and I thought the loss that I would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them it would never be equal
how about you? I guess I can see it from several different perspectives but when I hear about things like what they've been reporting about in milwaukee to me I don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy maybe there is I don't know
that's true and he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society he's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation
I don't know I really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko and for the things he's done I don't know I guess it's either put him in jail for the rest of his life or capital punishment
that's true because a lot of these conversations I've had on this program these telephone conversations have revolved around criminal justice
or whatever and most of the time I hear myself saying we don't have enough room left in the jails and people crime is still climbing
and we need to have different punishments
but I just am scared of capital punishment I guess I can
you know there is always that chance but I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever I don't know but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gon na be you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that for any situation really but when you find somebody just like that situation it was disgusting when I read about it today and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty I guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him and especially when it's so far removed if it's no one that I know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life
and trying to rehabilitate him too and
letting him out again and nobody wants that
everybody would be just as scared to death we've had a real problem here in texas with prison overcrowding and they've been releasing people left and right and they've committed murders and rapes and everything else and you just think where's the justice here
they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving
that's true I just recently moved to massachusetts I'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but I do know that they are notorious for paroling people
when and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes
and I guess they said do you think it should be restricted? I guess if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment
I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense
violent crimes with just malicious intent that's exactly I'm not saying I think capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case especially because there are some cases when you just don't know and I think there's a shadow of a doubt like with this guy in milwaukee it he pretty much confessed to it they just everything cannibalism and everything else
I really would have a hard time especially if I was on a jury not wanting him to be executed
hang? because that's just awful
and what is he going to do prison to the other people? I have a hunch that the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either they I don't know from what I hear about jail life is not any way to live
but I don't know it's just
I saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back she was off drugs and everything
but she said in prison you can get anything you can any drugs you want there's it's just like being outside people find ways around
and there's a power structure that you have bow to and for some people who have been there for over and over and over it really isn't as bad there's it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation and maybe that's one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it's not so scary anymore that
especially like repeat offenders it just appalls me that they even get a ten year sentence and be out in two or three or four years that's scary because I think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're going to be committing any more violent acts or not
and what they're going to be doing when they get out
and it's really scary I I don't know what the perfect solution to that is but I know that especially with violent crimes where you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else then I guess I just really don't see much use for this guy in milwaukee for instance that's just I could see capital punishment in a case like that and for other people too that do things like that but when my wife and I are both participating in this survey and she picked up the phone and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment so she was
handed it to you? luckily it was for me because they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other
I see so she tried to enter her number and it wouldn't work so she said it's for you
but I don't know I struggle with it but I really think that in terms of like this I think that it might not be such a bad thing because I don't know that anybody would feel good if you let someone like that loose in your community I'm you'd have to be scared to death
maybe if they had more money or more resources to work more on rehabilitation deep down I think every human
I understand that it's being proposed as a requirement for young people to go into public service I think
all young americans they did not specify exactly what young means I think that it probably would be a good program I think probably two years is too long
I think maybe a year would be the longest
you're probably right two years might be a little too long and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody
that's right that would be the problem sure would
so I think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing to get out there and do so
or maybe offer them some sort of an incentive to do it college credit something
I'm not sure what but college credit is a good idea because
I'm not sure they need to be paid a super do salary of any kind
but that kind of takes away from public service that's right they probably couldn't do anything monetary but I think giving some kind of college credit
but just to receive a letter in the mail that says you need to report somewhere by next monday
I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea I don't think so either because a lot of people depending on how the public service programs are set up and I'm not that familiar with them to know
I'm not either really but if a lot of people flat can't afford to that's right you know
that's right and most kids these days have gotten themselves into financial situations where they have to be working all the time
that's right they need young families whatever so it's a really tough question that's right
they just couldn't take off to do that
and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that postpones their college for a year
that's right and that would upset a lot of people too because they just want to get on it sure would
it would have to be a lot of thought given to something like that I would think I think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program
but I think it can't be something that's mandatory
it has to be something that's voluntary which is pretty much the way it is now they might
that's right I'm not even really sure at this point in time what programs are out there and that's the other thing is that instead of making it mandatory they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and go to the schools and do programs and tell them that we need your help and volunteer for such and such a time
and you've a choice of where you want to go
and handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
maybe if there was something they could do in their own town or city and not have to pull up roots and go somewhere half way around the world or something in their own community
that's true most of them probably wouldn't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents that's right
that's true too that's true too but they would have to be supported in some way and I'm not sure that those programs are available to do that
me neither and you wonder what kind of quality job would they do just sit around for their year
or would they really make a contribution of some kind
it's tough it's tough it is tough it's and I don't know who's even proposing it or how they plan on implementing it if they do
I'm not sure either but I think there would have to be a lot more information disseminated before you say let's do this
I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them
it be it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money
they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that
that's right you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience get them all in the auditorium
and you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something
and I think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded
but they don't know where to go to do anything that's right
that's a real waste too it really is it is it really is
I don't really see the emphasis on things like peace corps like we saw back in the carter administration
that was a big thing with him
and as a matter of fact I guess kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was really interested in things like that
I just don't hear much about it anymore like I say I don't even know what programs are even ongoing now I don't either that's one
anyway it's a tough question it is a tough question
thanks for your time I enjoyed talking to you same here take care you too you ready?
what have you seen lately?
it's funny when I tried to make the call the other days I thought
I hadn't seen anything since dances with wolves but today I went to see regarding with henry I'm dying to see that
it was really good we
jeff wariner just got out of the hospital
and jeff and deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood and we all liked it we had both moms and fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and everyone enjoyed it
and I am just dying to see it I went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a baby sitter and we'll all go see regarding henry
and I said I want to see it so bad
my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones I had wanted to see
and so since he had this friend up from houston and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this I thought I want to see this one too I
finally it's my first summer movie let me see was it we went to see one hundred and one dalmatians last weekend and that may be right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on we're going to the movies and we won't she goes all the time but I go maybe once every couple of months
and when I go I go see two at a time so we went to see soapdish and
was that good? cause hysterical we laughed so hard it was just you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard
I want to see that and city slickers both I love comedies but that's what I was that's the other one that we went to that night
was it? and my face hurt so bad from laughing because I love billy crystal
and course growing up on the back of a horse and being on ranches and stuff so much of that was so true and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles it was so funny both of them were great
good I'm glad to hear that because they they are we just laughed so hard and like I said with soapdish it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical
they just carried it off to the tee
I don't know if you got to see weekend at bernie's that was out a couple of years ago
they had a free showing at the berkeley united artist how neat
and I don't know who was here or whether jay called a friend and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we'd try it free movie
it was so funny and it sounds like what you were just describing soapdish too we hurt by the time we came out
and the whole theater was hysterical and it's just goofy it's if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on t v I would think I think it is I think it is
cause it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious
I imagine the way soapdish was but with everyone laughing
I never laughed and people were just screaming and applauding and it was just hysterical
I'm glad you did that before your surgery me too because I don't even know if I could live through it now
I'm getting around real good and I'm just still real sore
and today course I went back to work two weeks after
but I don't have permanent work right now I'm working with a temporary agency and so the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free
so I went up to do wordperfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed
and then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day and I said yeah and I went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that and I worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week and so I went to my doctors last thursday
and this was my fourth week checkup and he said you're just healing really well I just can't get over this he says in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things if you want to play ball you can go play ball he says I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to
and he was teasing me and he says you'll be out there waterskiing I can just see it now
and he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks I said I will I will whatever you call easy I'll do it and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it
and so I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I'm still sort of on the sore side
but what's your next have you seen robin hood yet?
that was one jay got to see with a friend and so I
and to try and find time it's hard with jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go
and I'm holding out for city slickers for the two of us because we had friends that went to see that and said it's just perfect for our age group
because I think he needs a comedy too and that's what he would have liked to have seen regarding henry too but knew that we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful we're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing there's just not enough time to do it all
and realistically he knew he couldn't get them all in
but jay really liked robin hood when the choir group went to see backdraft they thought that was it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said the plot line and the characters aren't real big but the fire scenes and that action part is fantastic
but he thought robin hood was great it was real different then you'd expect but he enjoyed it
and so I went course I am a kevin costner fan me too and supreme
I really like him a lot which is why dances with wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months
but was that wonderful
it was I in fact a friend from germany was visiting in march and we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it too
I just thought that was terrific and I really enjoy harrison ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see I do too I think he's really good
and he's very good in regarding henry that's not an easy part to play I don't think I wouldn't think my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night so I sort of think I may go do that
that one won't your sides
it was this the first time you got to see one hundred and one dalmatians? or I my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between ashley and jamie's age and we went to the
the first thing what do you think you would offer as far as information about selecting a school?
first I think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do
once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer do you feel that the depending upon the field I know there are some fields which a person should go to that school all four years but I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary
a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's your core education your general education requirements
if they want to get a liberal arts degree I don't know what advice I'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to that's what I did
I didn't care about the program or anything else I went where I wanted to go what was your degree in?
political science political science I know I'm going to school right now and I have a friend
where are you at? u t d university of texas dallas
I guess everybody's in dallas that I talk to I'm in north carolina I know that's where texas instruments is
something that I think that I've noticed that I have a friend I think if you're going into law or medicine a very particular very specific field even engineering you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public institution
and it's a lot cheaper
my parents made a mistake in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years
and she found out after that she said my parents they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago
but right now I just as far as selecting a school I feel that a lot of it depends upon the major
it does I didn't know what I wanted to do after I got my degree
originally I had planned undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration and I went ahead and pursued that I got as far as the thesis and decided to hell with it I didn't want it and from that point I went to law school
and after a year and a half of that I decided I didn't want that either
haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up
but I really did enjoy the law that's where I wanted to be but I didn't want to go through the hassle that the law schools put you through because I never did want to be a practicing attorney I just wanted a law degree
and I've since discovered that I would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what I like
and you don't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to
so that's what I'm pursuing right now
and I'm pretty happy with it so far I'm pursuing what's called an interdisciplinary field I'm a speech therapy major
and fortunately I have a good medical background and
that's probably very useful it's actually turning out to be more useful than what I thought
and I also have a good languages background linguistics and some psychology
it's all working together
the only field I'm not familiar with really is education which requires about four or five different fields really so it's a
I thought at one time I wanted to be a teacher but I quickly dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet
I said I couldn't do this everyday
maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing you are a disgruntled graduate student
I am just a disgruntled person all around
I'm the original mister scrooge I guess
I just I think there is I think law would be a fine profession fine field to go into I know one time I was in a political science class and talking about fields people going into different fields I made an off the cuff remark about lawyers about their integrity being questionable
and that was like a can of worms
you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school there was a woman she said my best friends are lawyers and all this and it was just
that remark in itself is a slam my best friends are lawyers I know
my best friends are blacks or jewish it used to be jewish jewish now blacks
and I guess iraqi now is the I know it's but
law was a lot of fun until you get to law school
and it doesn't become fun anymore I have a friend she's going into law another friend going into law and she's I'm really concerned about she's just going to be what's going to happen when she gets there
you going all of her dreams will be dispelled
if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse
I think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful
it is I see that happening very much so it's a lot of that
it was enjoyable for a while but it's such a grind
and you begin to wonder if I'm not you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it
if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it
I wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and I aged ten years
but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law I went to a language school and it was an united states institution I was military at the time and I think probably the biggest
what branch were you in? what branch were you in? I was in the air force?
I was too for myself I think that military experience was fine I just wish that there was something else that I could have done with
I got tired of the service after a while it I had a terrific job really enjoyed it what was your job?
command post I was a linguist
I was just wondering were you in sac by any chance? were you in sac? in tak? sac I wasn't
I thought maybe you might have had some experience with the r c one thirty fives I didn't go flight crew matter of fact I didn't make it completely through that field I was in intelligence school and about three weeks short
I didn't make it I sort of washed out
after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training it's something
I think that's why children really need to think about the field they're going into and spend a lot of serious reading not just thinking about
they actually should do some reading
that's right and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it and they should study it
I think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school
they find out just how much of a people person they are
that's true I found that out when I was in high school I worked at mcdonald's and I tell you what I worked at mcdonald's as well and I can tell you one thing there are just some people that I you just came to the point where and I eventually worked as a lab technician and I worked front desk and somebody could walk in the door and I knew exactly what they were going to do and say
I was the same way too I'm not a people person I hate having to play such a nice guy especially when it's all phony especially when you got some jerk coming in
I it's just not for me I deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why I'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot
that's good I was just wondering getting back to the school thing so I almost wish that there was something there you go first question do you own your house?
we try it's a big mortgage in the sky and someday maybe we might even own it but for all practical purposes I guess we hold the mortgage our name is on the till
so that implies ownership no one else has offered to pay for it that's right I would not object if anybody did
really they could move right into the spare room we have had this one for five years now before that we lived in garland probably about four blocks away
liked the area chose to stay inside of spring park it's a I don't know if you have been up here but it is a residential homeowners association
so there's a lot of activities a lot of pluses and common land but we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market it could not possibly have gone any lower and so we were wrong five years ago
I think what it bottom out about a year later
it just recently I would say I would give it two years back when it was bottomed out oddly enough two years I think that
but maybe not in your area it was just different areas not in this area cause this is about the
that's a really nice area
besides it's not richardson is it? it's still considered garland it's richardson
it's richardson and hold on a second paul I can hear you perfectly perfectly well I don't want to hear you you are being rude whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the phone the answer is no do you understand? how does that sound?
there you go write that one down there I go
it sounded good to me I hate to say how long that will last too this area up here is all custom homes and it's
I don't think that many by the builder that built this house and we were not the first owners I think we are the third owners
it was built by the architect for himself who never moved into it who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep
caulking windows was a great mystery to them
so they just watched the water pour in on the carpet but it's a sharif myneer homes if that means anything it did not really mean anything to me except I liked it
I kept thinking of omar sharif every time I saw that name somewhere so he builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now I think he got out of the lower end market and decided
but the houses here in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred
but still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine which is nowhere near what we paid for it
and I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot heavily wooded off the golf course
and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars let's see what I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek or if it was eighty and a hundred probably eighty I think it was sixty eighty sixty eighty I think
because I know our little house over here stuck in the middle of the subdivision is fifty five so I think the high end is definitely somewhere there try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot it could not be because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars just never
maybe that's pretty close to what it would have sold for brand new or that's pretty much what it was built for it's got an awful lot of nice things in it but I think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really desirable it's seems like people go for square footage only now
and have you been back to the perry homes back here?
the ones that look like brick houses? the one that looks like monopoly apartments
I think those are awful I'm sorry I just don't see the designer's I just see him as trying to squish as much house into the space as possible they are huge when you are inside them
they are very spacious they are I was in one today it was forty two hundred square feet
that's the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I because there's just the two of us and the two cats can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them
that's true but I have been watching these houses go up and I don't somebody was telling me I know somebody who lives back there I have always questioned the quality of construction and I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
when you watch them go up you are just amazed that they do not fall over
and it takes them something like thirty days to complete a house
that's amazing right now in fact even as we speak we are having a deck put on in back and these guys are phenomenal they are doing such a terrific job back there you pay for it too but it's really worth it they are putting in a deck a redwood deck and it's just they are doing such a fine fine job we have got three different levels of decking because this lot slopes way back down I'm really excited about it
and the house is built around the trees
and with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up so it's real real shady but that's one of the few things that really immediately pays back on return but what I was going to tell you these perry homes back there
when the people from m c I come down and they are used to the virginia area metropolitan d c
they come down here and those houses that look the colonial look what the
looks like the george town brownstone
and the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house must be a dream
because those things are selling like hot cakes but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month and I thought
I can't and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here and I was thinking I know why your god damn bill is so high
he has no insulation probably it's because there's no insulation in those things
what a trap any yet they show very well unless you have lived in a lot of houses around the area or looked at a lot of houses around here
and you ask the right questions and can research
and I think that makes a big difference but I like this area and everything that I have been saying says that it's
I do too I think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even
but still it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that you're in the how would you go about organizing a family reunion?
for I grew up in the deep south south alabama so whenever I think of family reunions my family got together almost every week
and there would be thirty people so people talk about big family reunions and I think I have a friend who just went to wyoming to some big ranch where there were four hundred people for their family reunion
and I so how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives
since I came from my father has five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters so I both of my parents had big families and we always got together just always now it's different because I live here and I when I go home I try to see as much of the family as I can but it's real different
and I grew up in a real not normal setting with all of you living so close together
sunday dinner was at my grandmother's and like I said there would be thirty people and everyone would just bring things and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook
and I come from a very small family and we planned a family reunion this spring where we are from texas and my family is from ohio and we met in florida
so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to disney together so that's all the family so planning our family reunion was very easy
I guess so it really sounds like it was fun we had a wonderful not be a very good conversationalist on fishing I don't do a lot of it
I do love to fish good maybe I can learn something
I don't know how much you can learn I'm not so sure I'm good at it but I do enjoy doing it do you?
it is fun what little I do of course I don't I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing I told my husband last night when I had called and they had told me that this was a topic I said I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm he said I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about I hope it is there's not a whole lot of different kinds that's about the only kind I know how to do
I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing because I get seasick but we have a lot of lakes here in this area
and I do a lot of fishing for bass we have a couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass
and then when I get tired of them outwitting me I fish for catfish
and we use worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows
and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms
it all depends on what I'm fishing for and the time of day it sounds like you do quite a bit of it
I do there's a lake maybe two or three miles from here and it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think fishing's a good way to do that and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing do you have a boat?
I don't I have a friend who has a little inflatable raft and we use that sometimes I wish I had a boat but I don't I think the lakes are probably different in michigan than they are in texas the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock
but unless you have a boat you can't really get into where they call the good fishing holes
that's the same way here isn't it? is it?
you have to get back in the sticks in the my in laws live on a lake a little bit east of dallas kind of in the piney woods and the lake is beautiful and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish but actually catching fish to eat per se you don't really do much of that right there I catch a lot of little old perch
and then the turtles try to eat up all my bait
so it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit
we don't have a big problem with turtles but it's kind of fun
but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes I would be afraid of that
and I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them do they ever get on your hook?
we occasionally I'll catch an eel on a hook but never the snakes they just kind of are they poisonous snakes?
we have a lot of cotton mouth so they are definitely
and they live in little coves that I like to fish in so I seem them swimming by every once in a while I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those
they're certainly ugly we saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in laws place last year it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that great big snake and of course it scared the women to death but the men come out and said that's only a king snake it won't really hurt you but it looked so bad
and it was so big that it might not would have hurt us but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there definitely but they're scary looking
do you have bass? I think that probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else
that's pretty much the same way here
I they have a lot of bass tournaments
we have those I don't
inevitably if I enter one of those I never catch a thing
I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it that's kind of we've never entered a tournament or anything we're not that big into fishing but I see a lot of people early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out and they'll say there's a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament
so I think there's a lot of people that have really I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing they're really into it to try to win definitely my
certainly here they are but it's a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around the peace and calmness is really relaxing
it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish that's what I do a lot I've never tried taking a book with me I'll have to try that one of these days
up there maybe you guys don't have as big a problem with air pollution as many do you?
we have a terrible air pollution problem do you really?
our summers are extremely hazardous
and during certain wind directions because we get the gary indiana chicago pollution
and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze coming up along the lake that's horrible
and they do post warnings for people who have heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season
in the winter it's not as severe
but if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
the state of wisconsin as a matter of fact started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
I don't think it's going to go very far but it was a way of triggering awareness
so what's the conditions like in dallas? in dallas I haven't seen air pollution quite on a level that we had in denver I grew up in denver and I've lived there most of my life and we used to have the posted warning days however in colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now as far as health concerns
due to the emissions control on the vehicles seems that all of our smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry
wisconsin has a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for their pollution control equipment
and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it is drivable
so they've tried to do a lot of that
and I there seem to be at least in certain little pockets and we were talking earlier about madison
madison has one of the nicest bike road sharing programs of any city in wisconsin
and all wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
and there is a real promotion of biking
but there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere
I find that a little irritating because I don't think it's always so necessary
it becomes maybe to you and I who have grown up in some more beautiful parts of the country I think that we become a little more aware rather quickly of what's happening with air pollution and how horrible it really is I notice people in dallas seem to say there's air pollution but how bad could this problem really be
send them to wisconsin
and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from the acid rain
and they may wake up
how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain
it's really a serious issue for those of us up in this sector up here or do you hypothesize that most of the smog or air pollution comes from vehicles or does it come mostly from industry up there?
I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of the gary area
and I don't know exactly where it emerges from when it's up in the northern sectors of wisconsin
that causes the acid rain that I'm a little uncertain of but I do know that it is a problem
I had talked with my parents I was born in muncie indiana and grew up a little bit in terre haute and I had asked them before I went back to visit recently about a year ago and I asked them I said did you ever realize the air pollution that was
I don't guess we got our first credit card back in the early seventies when I first got married
was a visa card issued out of a liberty bank in oklahoma city
because my sister worked at some bank americard center there
so we were still in college and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified they've come in handy over the years
and they have become also a real bother sometimes
tell me about it especially if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation it's just easier to put everything on a card
and I find if you're not careful you wind up a month or so staring those bills in the face and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff and it adds up
they add up quick so sometimes especially traveling with t I everything goes on american express
and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
but as far as personal life goes I guess I really try to use them as little as possible
I kind of like having them for gasoline purchases
we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies but but other than that I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day
and then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it
how do you look at counting credit cards?
we just quit using them that's
and they got us in trouble we took a loan and paid them all off we keep one gas card and visa just in case there's an emergency or something
but other than that we don't use them anymore that's kind of the way we were doing it's
I guess for that very reason that if you're not real conscious of what you're doing it's just too much by the time you get
if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month
and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
I know isn't that funny?
and I give them maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid because they're know if you don't then they're adding on eighteen nineteen twenty percent sometimes it's twenty two percent interest
and then some of them add late fees on it if they don't get paid
and I guess that's one of the motivations behind the american express card with t I there's no
with the american express card from t I there's no late fee
there's no interest rate
you either pay the thing off or they come get it and it's turned into personnel and they come get you
so they've got quite a bit more motivation to get paid then some of the others do
but that's the one that your call center manager sees every month
so you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
can you use that one for personal use?
you can? you can use it like any other card
but you know that somebody every month
I see and who knows how many people are looking at those bills that come in and those statements
you're not the only one
so you want to make sure that is that okay that those people see what it is that you are buying
and most of the time it is
but most of the others I've sent back all you get is card offers I've got three card offers now from gas companies and visa gold and some other bank
citibank is always sending the visa stuff out and I usually just throw them away because I don't want another one
I do too I don't even open them much I throw them out I don't want to have to mess with it you carry around a wallet full of credit cards
and one of these days it's going to all be full
a girlfriend of mine found a it was a visa or mastercard she found an ad for one in a good housekeeping magazine for eleven percent that's not bad
I need one of those if they don't say no annual membership on them I'll throw them away years ago I had my visa card through this bank in oklahoma city for probably fifteen years
and then they started charging annual membership fees and I said I'm not paying you why do they do that? it's just another way to make money as far as I can tell
they get enough on the interest they've been
and I guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards they're going to get cards at twenty bucks a pop
there's going to be that much more
so then a couple years ago I found a bank here in plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a visa card through them and no annual membership
so I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and got my visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee it would be okay
but I can't see paying someone to use their card
I can't either be charged their eighteen percent interest so
I think you're right the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere
gets a lot of people in trouble it sure does maybe they're counting on that I don't know I guess that's it thanks for talking nice talking to you
I'll let you start first?
I'm presently living in a house first time we had the house built and so this is our fifth year in it I guess and it was a real excitement to go out and select the house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses and as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in dallas fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart so I would not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in because they're overpriced but they're a cheap house if you can't afford something good they're good for that and you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what you're getting the longevity of the house is not worth it how about in your case? in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he's in electronics but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it so it took him about two and a half years but he built us a house it's we have thirty two hundred square feet and it's a brick house and price wise it was great because he did it all himself so that way we could kind of control it
and we live in kind of a small town
and it's nothing fancy it's a house it's nice and it's real pretty and we're all comfortable in it
that's great that's great that's I've heard I have another gentleman friend of mine who had a house built as a matter of fact another guy is building one now he's been doing it for three years and the city's a little upset with him but I understand you save a lot of money off by doing that and you can because that way you're not having to pay the middle men and everybody else nothing wrong with that you know
I'll vouch for that but of course my husband did everything except my brother's a trim carpenter and he came in and did the inside for us and that helped
that was a big savings and and we had to hire the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing he did everything else we've been in it six years
that's great have you been in it long?
have you any plans to maybe expand or move onward? we're our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it but he will not build a second one himself because he says age wise he'll never be able to handle that again I see
first one is always a bear
we're having an architect friend of mine design a house for us and that can basically be put in any state so that's kind of we just got with him and told him what all we wanted
and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it and he's certified and registered at least we know it's not going to fall in or something if it's built
but I have heard that your approach is right you can actually go out and sub it even if you don't want to get hands on
you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things and that's kind of the plan I have so I'm
everyone I talk to I file in my little book and do other things with it that's great that's great but like I said otherwise the expense but we could not have one as large as we have if we hadn't did it ourselves
I can imagine it's not an eldorado house or anything like that but it's ours if you're happy with it that's all that counts that's right that's right
that's all you only have to satisfy yourself and no one else apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high
that's an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell I guess isn't it? it really is because I'm always shocked at what they have it appraised at I think my goodness
that's great I guess that about does it and it was nice talking to you
nice talking with you too let's see
so what gets you? as far as I'm
the thing I think that annoys me the most is I have young children a baby in the house and inevitably as soon as they're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something
and I think that that is probably the most aggravating
it invades my time I'm the one that pays for the phone if I want to buy something I'll take the initiative and go find it and that just really does aggravate me what do you think?
I that's exactly the kind of thing I would have said although in my case it's my wife and I both work we come home and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings
and it's one solicitation call after another and your time is valuable
it's like you say very annoying and
and why do we let this happen I that's interesting I the market seems to just be growing too I guess enough people are not speaking out I'm not speaking out that's for sure I just get aggravated about it and
would you if you could legislate something what would you legislate? I really don't know I'm not into heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas but I don't know I do particularly find it annoying I'm really not sure I haven't given that a lot of thought if it should go to be
it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that that might
and the people making these calls would be obliged to compare their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called identify themselves
that would be an interesting way
and that way those who want it can have it and those who don't want it don't have to have it
sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself you're
except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers automatically is that right? that's interesting and and they just get everybody
I do wish that it would stop on my end because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments
and I guess the next one is door to door solicitors
I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school I have kids and that's just kind of part of it
but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning it makes you not feel particularly safe
and it's annoying as well
and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob you really don't know so I find myself being a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than I might normally be
but I do feel like it's an invasion of my space and
what about these telephone callers who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire I've never quite understood the purpose of that I
I think these people were hired from different sources just
with and so therefore there's no one answer but basically it's a market survey just a survey
but they never say who they're really working for or what questions are
there have been a couple of times when whatever the subject was caught my interest and I went along with it and then there have been several times when I just said I just really don't have the time to deal with it at that moment
but I don't get too many of those I've had just a few
generally someone's trying to sell me something or
and sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
other times it's wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose
for which if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider that's right
but a dollar isn't it it's
and I also sort of worry that sometimes people giveaway personal information when the call comes and they sort of seductive to somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things and so I start answering and then you go down a path
and you don't know where it's going to end
in fact you don't even know the totality of what you've revealed we
and this is most likely not going to be used against you that's true
but it could and that seems to be something that should really be outlawed because it's subject to abuse you just never know I guess that I
and it asking for information is I can't really see that I think if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp and when it arrives at your house I
I think I get most of my news in headlines from the radio and then I follow up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention
I do about the same but in a different fashion I'm from new york originally and now that I live in florida I live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the summertime
and I feel that the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the new york times
I've always read the new york times when I was younger and I try now that it has a national edition I read that I guess I do watch mcneil lehrer on p b s because I lean to that coverage
and I guess I'm I like them but they take so long I don't always have time
there it's a whole hour show actually it's an hour show each evening and we turn it on when we start dinner we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up
I find that I'm leaning on I travel a great deal even overseas and I find that I lean on c n n quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out I don't believe everything they say but it's coverage I think c n n does a pretty good job I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad until the gulf war
and they seemed to have the best coverage they had more information sooner than most of the other networks
I peter arnet was reporting direct from iraq I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him
I think he reported what he saw
and if you didn't like it that was just too bad I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted but I think they said that frequently enough that you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective
that's right I think so and I guess when it comes to magazines I don't read I used to when I was younger I subscribed to time and u s news and world report I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or I also subscribe to something called world press which is a magazine that only talks about other excerpts from the world press
which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not as slanted as the new york times or as biased perhaps as the local paper
but that and the radio I listen to p b s radio a lot and I also listen to these twenty four hour news stations when I'm driving I we have a c b s twenty four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work and
do you read are you from southern or northern california? northern I'm from the peninsula
what is that palo alto
the san francisco paper out there is the major paper? it's horrible
and that's a terrible paper the san francisco paper is just wretched so I subscribe to the san jose mercury news
is that pretty good? palo alto is about midway between it's a whole lot better than that san francisco paper and
what is that the chronicle isn't it? there's the chronicle and the examiner
but they're both run by the same
they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read I they're just horrid so we read
can you get the l a paper up there? that's a pretty decent paper isn't it or we can but I don't like it
so we subscribe to the new york times and the wall street journal and mercury news
that's another one I read I forgot that I read the wall street journal not as in depth as I used to because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer but again I read that two columns on the front
I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff I feel pretty well versed in what I'm doing because I do spend more time on that than I do on sports
I spend a lot of time reading about these things I'm quite interested I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now today and I think we do get pretty good coverage I don't feel that the american people is being shortchanged by the news coverage
if anything I think they we almost have too much
I don't know I hear a lot of criticism about listening to the dan rathers of the world and taking their word for it or their comment actually I think they slant things but I can not stand dan rather I remember him when he was a local newscaster in houston
no kidding and I hated him then
I didn't know that and I would not watch that man for money
and he and barbara walters just really turn my stomach
was he so I watch peter jennings and tom brokaw sort of alternately
how do you feel about it? I guess I got to say if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to I don't know if it said that I feel I'm well enough equipped do we get enough news or something like that?
to do we get the news that we want?
and I do I really think
I think I do too I think you got to segregate some of it
that's about all I have to say nice to talk to you nice talking to you
I have I used to have the opinion that there really was not any more crime in america in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries before simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced reporting methods with computers and other devices compile more statistics that's right and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets
however I have been persuaded lately simply by the overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime
more especially where you are are you in washington d c or washington state?
I am in washington d c
I was going to say it I do a lot of business here and I come here quite often and that again is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington regardless of the racial makeup
but it's real there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they
it just really grabs your attention
it just makes the whole place seem like that just to focus on that a minute when bennett became the drug czar for president bush he was going to focus on this area and do something about it
and I see that even he was met with little success even though quite a bit of money and other planning efforts went into that
what do you think is causing all this
because it seems that there even though crime though I think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too
I have three theories about it three things I have one theory and it's brought to us by two things one I believe that this is a function of the violence that young people see on television and the movies
and I am not just talking about role models of tough guys and gangsters and things like that I am not even convinced that maybe things like football hockey and even baseball games where everything is settled with a fight the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the argument
and then I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree so I think that particularly I was reading the other day about corpus christi texas which has the highest I think it's corpus christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in america per capita
I have not seen that but the saturday night special stuff so
that's what I think about it that's some of the things I think about it plus I do not know what are your views?
I tend to agree with you with it seems anymore a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some sort of violence or something in it
and along with that and then you start making a movie and there's no call for something violent so they just throw something in there just to say they have it that's the impression I get
and I imagine that it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society people want to it conditions people to it and you have to it has to be even magnified to attract people's attention to have them spend money on something like that you become callous
and I am sure that it does form role models for young men and young women and
I read now where we are young women are arrested fighting with knives over whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when I was young
I do not want to sound like an old fart but that's what
seems that those things did not happen in that manner before television
and I have to think that it has some influence on it but
I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time rush lynn bottom
I do not know if you listen to him or not
he's on a m but there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles the guy under gates
and they were just really coming down on him because of just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals for instance they asked him if he spanked his kids and he said you bet I believe in discipline' and people I guess they confused discipline with punishment
and just it seems anymore that if you have this type of a moral stance that people come down on you it's everybody has to be free to do their own thing and I disagree and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped was that there's so much of a return to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure and that is not emphasized I recognize there's over crowding problems and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that's complicated the entire process
what I also think that I guess it's the reflection of the society where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you live or I do not mean attachment and responsibility I guess I mean any sort of
nobody feels responsibility to do something it's I wish they would stop doing that that's right
I do not know how that's I do not think it's done by the changes come simply by statutory nature I do not know what it really will take
and I do not know if I have solutions except to I am sort of an advocate of having free speech and I guess to curb the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that
however there does seem to be a right now in verbalizing it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort
and then how many and the sacrifice is not that great
how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between what you see and how
what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do I think that's correct
and but as soon as you start texas has always struck me I have lived in and out of texas both in the service and short business stints and it seems to me they are a pretty tough law and order state but that's a but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state just citing that
unfortunately you have got a lot of the a lot of it can be contributed to the racial differences just that we are so close to the border with mexico
we have got a lot of that influence
this is really ironic that I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away
and it's just been tearing me up all day
I bet because we have just been looking all over for him we've been to the pound we've been to the humane society we've been to the adoption center we've just been all over the neighborhood we've been calling neighbors so this is just really strange
I guess so have you lost him before? this is the first time he's gotten out before but he's always stayed right here
he's never gone away and so this is just really strange because
what kind of a dog is he? he's part golden lab and part alaskan not alaskan I always forget australian shepherd and
he's a big one he's pretty big that's why it really surprises me that he hasn't come back because like I said he's never gone away like this before and I would think he could get hurt by a car or something I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big but I don't know
I hope he comes back that's too bad I do too
how long have you had him? about two years so he's
that's tough it's really
you get very attached to animals don't you? isn't that funny how we do? we just really
they're always there for you and they don't talk back to you
and it's kind of pleasant they're companions do you have any?
we have a dog a little white lhasa and her name is angel and we have a cat a white cat he's just a tabby just a and his name is dominique we call him neek but how do they get along together?
pretty good we had the dog first and she's kind of a wimp and the cat kind of rules
but she likes him all right we had another cat about two years ago it got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep
and then we got this new cat so I have two children and they really enjoy the animals and then my mother who's very elderly lives with us and she's really good friends with the dog they're very good buddies
that's what are so neat about animals like I said they're really companions and they're friends
that's right you can love them all you want and they love you right back and they don't
that's right they don't care what you look like or what you act like they just love you unconditionally I know
it's wonderful it's just so neat it's that's I don't know this is just so hard
I know it has to be it's like I said we've had him for two years and he's never he's gotten out but he's always been right there he's never been gone at all
he's just always been right there when he gets out
it's the first time he's ever been gone like this
that's really too bad that's awful I just knew today that we looked at the pound and that we just went all over the place and I knew we were going to find him and when we didn't it was so I don't know
I hope you'll find him you most likely will we keep they told us at the humane society and the adoption center don't give up hope and then not yet
have you put any posters up or anything like that? we were talking about that tonight since he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we were trying to find some pictures of him recently we've got so many when he was a puppy
but we just don't have a whole lot we have him on film on the video camera
but you can't put that on the
you sure can't so I don't know
we will put some posters and stuff up
that's good and hopefully that will help maybe around the neighborhood but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood so that helps too if they can keep
they can keep their eyes open so
that will help I think that if somebody else picks him up I think that if he gets out he'll come back
I really do because he knows exactly where he lives so
he will I bet he does
I know that it's hard on you I know that I'd be worried too I know it's just so ironic that this would happen and I would get this kind of a call
isn't it though? I know that's it's very strange but
I know sometimes our cat will stay out all night and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him that he's got in a fight or somebody's hit him and if he doesn't come by mid morning then I really get scared but he's always come back eventually so that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small
and they can get hurt a lot easier
they can get hurt a lot easier
they can so that would make you really tend to worry about them if they're not right there
but he's a real feisty guy he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property is that right?
he's cats are really almost more territorial than dogs are they just really do not want other animals on their property they're very very he just any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't jump at them or anything but he'll sit and he'll watch and I think maybe he would if it came real close but he's very protective of our property that's really I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them
so I never had them growing up
so I never really had them around me so I've never owned one since I
they're really a lot different than dogs because they're very independent and he's very affectionate when he wants to be but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll either scratch you or run away
but when he wants to be he's really affectionate he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and snuggle up to you but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him
but dogs seem to be always in the mood they're always right there and like you to pet them and loving that's true I like the way they come up and they'll put their head underneath your hand
that and most dogs do that
they do I don't know any that really don't they know exactly how to get that attention
they sure do they just come up and they put your
or they'll rub their head against you
do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go he's outside during the day and then we get home at night we do bring him in
you have a fenced yard or
the backyard it's really big too for him to run in and stuff that's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out because he's had all this room to run in but
how did he get out? he dug a hole under the fence
he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and we filled it back up put him back in there he did it again
so we chained him up
but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because we feel like that's just too restricting for him
so we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it so that he couldn't get out
he kind of ripped through the chicken wire
so I can't I just have not I don't understand because it's like he's got a good home he's got we have two kids that just love him a lot
it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out we just couldn't
you know that animals are like that they like to roam and investigate and see what's going on I guess that's
I guess that's probably true I don't think it's anything we did least I hope not
I'm sure that I know he really does have a good home I think that's what really bothers me the most about it it's like
how are your kids handling it? I don't know if it's quite hit them I have two girls
and they just been real I don't know at first they seemed to be upset but now it's if he doesn't come home can we get another dog
that sounds like kids it's wait a minute
poor buddy I said he's only been gone a day and you already want to replace him what's his name did you call? buddy buddy?
that's was our cat's name that died is that right?
we named him buddy after buddy bell the ranger baseball player that used to be here and we used to we were really into that when we got him going to the ranger games and we named him buddy beaner for some reason but buddy after buddy bell so that's funny
but he was a good cat too we miss him a lot
and I feel real guilty because we had him for six years and one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster and he got it
and I just felt so bad it's real contagious and it's and the vet said it runs rampant in this area I didn't know that
and if they don't have their booster any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically they get it if the other cat has it so I had no idea I did not know that
it was I just felt terrible I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was he was just getting real skinny
I don't know I grew up in the sixties and at that time it was a changing time for the whole music scene I guess and I grew up with the beatles and the rolling stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it for several years after I graduated from college and thereafter but have since I grew up in a small town in southern oklahoma I have kind of gone back to more of a county flavor in music I'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a opposite but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot sounding music it didn't have what I was looking for at the time country tells more of a story it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and I've become more of a country fan over the years
when you say that you grew up in the sixties I take it that was the teenage type years or that was my teenage years I was born in fifty and
we're very similarly aged so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times so I'm just a couple years older than you
essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me my early popular music interests were in simon and garfunkel whom I saw perform when I was in college and I became attached to that style of urban country if there is such a thing
I think in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend to have a dramatic or story approach to their music usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it over time I became very interested in baroque classical and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it very relaxing for me my tastes now run to a upbeat simon
it's something that interests me combined with the classical tastes I had mentioned and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred music I'm not a music I'm not particularly schooled in it I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music and I spent a good deal of time listening also to people from the late seventies really neil diamond for instance people of that particular time that's kind of the way I am
I listen to some country and western but I'm not schooled in it and I've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it I played a little bit of piano I continue to do that I want to do it and I never have the discipline to stay with it but when I do play and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a new piano player it's got basically an easy rhythm and tone
and it's easily something to fall into I'm kind of the say way I've gone through different periods of life in music from pop to classical I guess one of the things that influenced me was that I've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years trying to support my way through there and was support I was influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where I worked and I've developed a real love for classical music in probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was heavy into classical type music he said he used to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music that they were using behind them because they used a lot of classical music behind the cartoons and so consequently we wound up playing a lot of classical music there and I think that got deep seated into me one of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is are those that call on those classical roots I guess barry manilow comes to mind for some reason there's not a whole lot of his stuff that I'm real crazy about but he does have some things chicago had some things
and I think even electric light orchestra had some real influences by classical music and I'm still my favorite in fact most of my c d s are classical music
I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music I don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation a good example would be I have connections but not particularly deep ones to the vietnamese war type situations
and I found that I really like china beach and I particularly like tour of duty and both of them I had as much fascination of the background music going on as I did to the theme of the shows
and thirty something I'm particularly interested but it's the music almost that I find myself listening to
I'm kind of thinking that's maybe our generation was so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness now with the music that's behinds them
that could well be I spent my sophomore and junior year in college when I a song by the I think the title of it was just downtown
and if you recall how it goes downtown
all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of difficult times in school being behind on work
and my family now knows if they come into my study and I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done at school and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know to just stay away that's their signal
they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it
that's right when did you first take your first piano lesson?
probably about first grade
and I have returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes and then inevitably I am swept away by the pressure of other types of things
it is a time consumer
it is in order to continue to grow and I always think that I'll be able to do it and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted in composition themes
and I keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved
but in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude and I keep thinking I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but it doesn't for me
it's making that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it I was never able to master all that in fact my brother and sister both they were thirteen sixteen years older than I they went through the parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing
and when it came to my turn the folks said we're not going through that again they sold the piano and turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to so I
that's one of things I felt like I missed in life and I really in fact one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to chopin that is played on piano I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that
maybe one of these days I'll I'm kind of like you maybe one of these days I'll get around to it I'll do something with the piano but probably not
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance just never got a chance to come out
that's the most fascinating thing it's a pleasure talking with you and you sir best of luck in your graduate school take care tell me what you like to do
I collect antique tools for one thing I'm sort of in an antique business but it's a little sideline part time thing
and I'm building a log house at a farm that I have in east texas which is a hundred miles from here
it's really neat and course I've been working on it for five years but but how wonderful are you close to getting it done?
it's getting real close to
of course there's still a lot of work to be done and then when you get the shell finished you still have a lot of stuff to do inside but are you going to move your whole family over there then?
actually I'm not even sure I may I'll probably always have a place here in richardson or dallas kind of your getaway place
escape but it's beautiful it's eastern hardwood forest there are a lot of pine trees but it's mostly oaks and how beautiful and it's pretty flat there?
it's kind of hilly but it's low hills it's not I've only been to texas once I have two sisters in texas now one in austin one in dallas and the one in dallas is the one that got me to doing this
and I thought austin was beautiful you I liked the hills and the trees in
it's really different because that's the chalk hills down there limestone hills and you've always lived in texas have you?
except for time in service born and raised texan
I had never been there that's pretty neat my sisters both seem to like it pretty well my brother in law works for the university in dallas
at which one? he's admissions director
university of texas in dallas
it's just north of me here he's got a job there and this is his first year so it's been a real interesting thing for them that's great but they seem to like it okay I think they're too far away from me but maybe some day they can get closer we'll see
pretty good trip so what kind of hobbies are you in? I'm mother of four so basically I'm just real busy with my kids right now in sports and we have a little halloween talent show tonight and I substitute at the schools part time
that's great I am a travel agent at heart and my hobby is just I love traveling and being involved of that and finding out more but it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
so I've been librarian all this week which has been real interesting and I'm enjoying it I'm around my kids and
that's pretty easy substituting isn't it? it's great it's great and what else do I do I do lots of cross stitching when I have time
and I enter things in our little state fair and that's pretty fun
that's great but actually my hobbies mostly is my sports tennis I play tennis
I love tennis too do you?
and I ski do you ski? we snow ski we snow ski at mount bachelor mostly in oregon
that's great have you ever been there? wonderful place
I've skied in colorado and we usually go to new mexico because it's a little cheaper where in colorado?
I've been to telluride which is on the west side and copper
copper is kind of my favorite up there breckenridge and keystone I guess those are the only places I've skied up there I would love I can hardly wait to get up there me too
are you guys getting snow? we it is snowing right now we're to get one to three inches tonight
I heard aspen got three feet we are on the dry side of the mountains seattle is only about two and a half hours so of course I'm a real seahawks fan
and going over that pass is just a real nightmare
I can imagine and we're on the colder side they're on the rainy side we're on the snowy side and we ski my children all ski
and we have been to whistler in canada which is just a marvelous place whistler and black home is in canada and then we've gone to sun valley several times that's just a great place but not in colorado since I went to school what about utah? haven't been there I keep hearing these marvelous things about deer valley and haven't either city
always want to go to canada to banff or somewhere like that
and your kids all ski? not all of them
my kids are all grown
but my youngest son is a skier that's great my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death
when they're skiing they're fearless and they go off
I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music and none of them are recent
I like gordon lightfoot do you know who he is?
and the moody blues and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot and willie nelson you like a variety sort of easy listening because you like country but then but not all country I don't like that when they start
I don't know I just like willie nelson because he's such a character
I like some of his songs though they're not so sad country all the time they're just kind of sweet sometimes
they're not the typical country where they're just my wife left me my dog left me my truck is broken down
my truck's broken down and my house just burned down
but there's a guy have you ever heard of george winston he plays piano
I think he's dead now but he plays wonderfully I like that
do you play the piano is or you just like it? very badly I've got a piano
my mother got a piano and vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons and I was the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me and it's sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it it is real relaxing
it must be fun to be able to play it and if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be kind of fun I think
because I play the flute and not many things you can play people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either but I like a lot I like classical music just because of the when I don't play I like jazz music but so do I what's that? forgot about that what's that? I said so do I I forgot about jazz
I like a lot I like is it the new age music with the I don't know if you've heard neurotic collection we've got about five of those I love them
I love those too they're just so relaxing I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it
and I heard a piece and it was just so wonderful
and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it
isn't that nice it's nice when you have a piece that is so peaceful that everybody likes
and it has pieces that are uplifting but it's mostly relaxing and because it doesn't have words you don't feel like there's anything you have to remember as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean but you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it
and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music
my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the people that have written certain songs then he buys the pieces that have that person on it
I see what you're saying
I don't even know who did which ones but he does
I can't identify them either I just like them I know which ones come next but I don't even know their names most of them I don't know their names of the song but I can identify them but I like that and course I like classical music
and were you in the band?
I was in the band so was I
and I was in chamber music groups and stuff so I'm used to pieces and I played classical flute I didn't play jazz flute or anything like that so I can relate to it I suppose and I'm like you I like the older stuff too because I like chicago
and I like I like hebert you don't know hebert laws but hebert laws a flute player he's a jazz flute player and I like chuck mangione do you know who chuck mangione is?
I like chuck mangione trying to think of all what's his name plays the trumpet I like the moody blues did you like them?
I like moody blues I like mostly the older groups I think but we do have I like simply red we got simply red I figure all our c ds that we have what I really like and I like breeze I like the group I think just because they sound a lot like simply red if I'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays it's easy listening what type simply red I've never heard of that is it just instrumental?
it's got people singing but it is instrumental but it's got people singing but it's got a whole bunch of people singing
you know how many people are in simply red stuart he can't hear me I don't remember how many people but it's got men and women and it's nice I mean it's pleasant music it's not where it hurts your ears to hear it but it's not like chicago where it's got that much instrument to it it doesn't have all the brass and everything
my husband is telling me we have to hit the road we're going to go to commerce and see a friend and then I'm going to go to sulphur springs
you must live in this area where are you?
we're in sherman we're in garland
you're going to commerce?
for east texas or something?
just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else
they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas that's why I was just for colleges?
east texas is recruiting for their fall semester they're not
and they've been doing a lot of that in the area they're not going to recruit me anymore I'm through no more for me
no more what do you do?
right now I'm just a homemaker but I'm going to school for legal assistant and that's what I know and just nothing basically are you going to go to east texas for that?
it I don't go to east texas I got a degree from t w u but I'm really interested in the legal environment but I don't want to be a lawyer so I said I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant that'd probably be pretty interesting I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week they had summonsed eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial
this guy had supposedly strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire we stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until june
that's how it works and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said I can't believe I was summonsed I was an investigator and I was tailing the woman that was killed then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this socialite in plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced
and this is the man that was in front of you?
they'll weed him out the investigator
he got off right away
and I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that
so I figure that that will make me biased and I won't be chosen
not necessarily hopefully
but there's probably something else that might make you because you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury not be accepted for the jury
pretty much a lot of people would know about it and know some of the different things about it but they might weed you out some other way if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all the death penalty
but I said that I could believe in it in certain instances but I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody
there they would have a doubt about you that
because if that's what the punishment is in that instance then you're always going to say not you're not going to want to have him have that punishment so but then when you're picked I was picked for another murder trial before
and it's so hard because everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done and if you're trying to hold out there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision
especially with something where you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt you have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like do you really feel that sure about
how about you do you use p c s?
constantly you and me both
it seems everything I do is computer related
and if it goes down then we're stuck all day and so I like the I b m p c personally
but that's pretty much everything I've worked with and I've become so accustomed to it that it's second nature what do you use?
I have an I b m p s two model thirty
it's kind of getting too slow for me but my job I'm an e d p auditor so I audit computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level
and I use my personal computer constantly not only do I do p c type things like using lotus or word processors
I also use my p c to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I b m mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
so all I have on my desk is my p c but I'm getting not only our local area network but I'm getting two separate mainframe machines also so we use an I b m p s two also
and every now and then the file gets so big that it moves slower than I'd like
but I do mainly graphic work on it and a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it
and I don't know I enjoy working with them
there's so many capabilities out there the things you can do are endless
I've become kind of the p c guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground
and there's three of us e d p auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in p c's and the other just has not used p c's that much
so I ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and I'm the administrator for our local area network and I need to keep that going and so I couldn't live my life without a p c I don't have one at home we have one at home but I just don't find the time that I can use it
right now I would rather not have one at home because I would work at home
we've got a couple of portable lap top p c's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot to do work
if I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night one of the reasons why I got mine was before I went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because I am pretty much the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is
so they didn't know how it was going to work they knew they were going to have to get a modem in the decks machine in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so
but it's almost like we could become too dependent on them
and we use a lot of free lance
and that's pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things
and it compared to the way the things have really
what's the word I'm looking for I'm just totally drawing a blank
but the way things have changed over the years with the p c and the different programs is just great it's remarkable the things we can do now and compared to a few years just the power
I'm trying to get an updated machine mine is just putting along
and it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip but I don't know if my boss will spring for it but I'm determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one
we think about that a lot
that's what I do we had a printer a hewlett packard ready writer
and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to a central p c and you had to take your diskette to the p c to print something that's awful
so the first thing when I started working at this bank is I said first of all we need to all be able to share this p c without getting up so I talked my boss into investing in a it's not a real elaborate local area network
but we can share the printer and we can send files to each other
and we can send mail messages to each other which is good enough it's what we need
and then I talked them into buying a h p laser jet
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased it's fast it's quite it has good copy the copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers
I've got a little I b m pro printer on my desk
and I can use either the pro printer or I've got my p c configured to where I can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own
so if I just need something real quick and I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed I can just print it in my office we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
and it's just so the budget restraints and things like that makes it difficult and
they have gotten really cheap hewlett packard makes it's actually a dot matrix printer
but the quality is almost laser quality
and I think it's called the desk jet and I think they're about five hundred dollars now and we got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars
I don't remember what kind they were but we do a lot of transparencies
sometimes the color would take too long to plot out
so they just want black and white which we can just run them through the laser printer real quick because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it but it
so that's all you need for charts and stuff you don't need them in four colors if it was a customer presentation then that would be different
we would want to razzle dazzle a bit but it's we have one in the office and in our area if we want to use it like you said you had to change it put it on a disc and carry it over to there and see if they're not using the printer you use the system
and wait for an opportunity to use it
you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer until they got off the machine I know I know I understand
that was I was amazed when I came to work I worked at the it used to be the largest bank in san antonio until n c n b came up and bought the rival and now n c n b's got a little larger market share
but it's the only it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in texas it's the only one that's still alive
any way I work in a big prestigious place
and I couldn't believe when I walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this huge holding company sharing a h p rugged writer
I was going wait a minute come on guys this is crummy so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology
we're pushing real hard though we're trying the entire bank is not like that we the bank philosophy is one of innovation and lead the market
it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the senior vice president over audits is cheap
and it's real hard to pry money out of him to do these things but I was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and
we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when we work for a computer company and how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated that's obsolete
and some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's why do we need this can't you do that with what we have and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
unfortunately the computer equipment and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly for instance we bought a
have you ever had to put your children in child care mary dell?
I'm an old experienced hand I started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all
my daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby and I had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then I was really lucky to have put them in a methodist day school at preston hollow methodist right off of walnut hill and preston and it was a wonderful environment
I just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place I see so it worked well
how about you? I have a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in day care for the reason of me working
but they both went through preschool
and we've just been real lucky anyway to not
it's not hard to find anything that's part time so many of the churches have really strong preschool and children's day out half day programs
but it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown dallas but they seemed cold and impersonal
I just couldn't hack it
and what I liked about preston hollow is that the people that were there when cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity
she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
so it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts
and I'm really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff
that is a big drawback in the public schools out here to
you're lucky to have an art teacher and if you do you get them once a week or something
or pay for it after school our emily's in the third grade over at huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art and I willingly did it is that right? I had no idea but I thought this makes me angry
this is something that ought to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do
and with our budget cuts I'm sure that's not going to change anytime soon
that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that
so in some ways the day schools do serve those purposes that's true even the preschools they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten it's culture shock it's just
put the colors away get the computers out
which is too bad and that's hard
it's so difficult for them did you have your children in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home?
until they were two both times they were at our house so you were able to have somebody come there
and that was hard too I lucked out with really good people both times but I know so many people that are never able to find that and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you?
she didn't live with us the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a daughter through nursing school just purely on baby sitting money
and she kept cheryl during the day and then did more baby sitting at night
and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead
so that was a plus from that respect as well
and then with emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her I have
I just can not fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center I was just listening to a program this morning I guess it was on the home show but they were talking about a new I can't even think of the name of it I was halfway listening while I was painting
it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children
and they've now moved it to washington d c and the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said I can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there that would be hard
they give a lot more leave I work at n c n b now and our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people are really expanding
we have more options now then we did when my kids were born with being able to take off full time longer you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full time for up to six months that's great
it's really neat I've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint
we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals I've of course it's too late for me so I've not tried them to see how effective they are
but I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast it's amazing
and for our age group it's too late too little too late
but I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work
two income families are here to stay and I would think since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do the people that work in big business have families they have children
so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and
you retain employees and keep them longer that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our employee assistance programs that they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
so I hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full time that's good
because that's hard that's good to know I have a couple of friends that have found a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age
and they usually you'll find a woman that's keeping six children or four to six children in the home
and my future sister in law's mother does that too full time
in plano though the problem is you find and this is what I found with emily from the time she started first grade I wanted her out in plano area
and I kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move
she ended up being in a different home every year too transit and I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move and her surroundings
so this year I tried kinder care and then she's old enough to
have you done any painting projects lately?
this is a great topic for me because I just did my first two painting projects ever
was not a big deal what kind of painting was it? two little deals
the first one I helped someone repaint an apartment and it was very easy was it?
and I've never painted I always thought it would be so you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something
but I know I can do it
and the second one was I bought some toys at a craft fair
they're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for christmas and so I decided to paint them and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment what kind of paint did you use for the bookends?
that's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base so I had to get and when I painted them I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so I had it all over my hands at first I didn't realize I had never painted anything so I didn't realize that I needed that
I kind of knew in the back of my mind you can't use oil on wood?
you can use it on wood but I just had it all over my hands and I went to wash the brushes out and wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water you have to get a solution and you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway
I had to drive to the store
I had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and everything like that
and then downstairs in the apartment we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean is that what you usually use in the house is latex? and it just
the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it it says safe for children and all that I heard about that I guess a friend of mine had a she just started up a day care center and one of the real strict restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
so she had that done but
have you painted anything recently I had to paint the inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some farm equipment in was it huge?
and what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer and I had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner
but you just took a roller and put it on there and if you saw that the wood was getting wet that was all you needed so
it was it used all of it I guess it was about three hundred yards worth so I guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually
I think though we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because I don't know if I could I don't know
I don't know must be difficult what about the trim in your house? did you have to do that?
it was really easy I just we had a couple of different size brushes real easy
I went around the trim and if it and there was wall paper I was just doing just the trim around the doors and windows and there was wall paper and if we got it on the wall paper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off
so there was no major mistakes there was did you have one coat or two? two actually
and it there was around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that that would be really a time saver
if you just we didn't tape anything
we weren't that careful but it wasn't I don't know it's funny it's like if you just go slow at least I didn't get that many mistakes
I didn't make that many mistakes me I would have had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and then I'd have probably rolled it on it would have taken me forever
why? just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it before the first time it probably would have taken me forever so
it wasn't if it was my own I would have but my friend said just go ahead you just go ahead it's easy
I said it's your place how long did it take you all?
a couple of week ends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and so there was two of you all?
they were doing all sorts of repairs and I was just painting because I don't know how to do anything else that's easy enough
so there's a whole bunch of people
so now I feel like if I ever buy a house I can probably paint if nothing else I think I could probably do it as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then I could do it
but I went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true
but I didn't realize what pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex I don't if it's worth the shine
steve did you go to college?
in fact I'm still going that's good so you probably could give some great advice
I don't know about that but in fact I'm in the process of trying to choose a p h d school
what's your interest your
computer science and cognitive science
so that's similar to what I'm in a p h d program right now
I see and my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical than computer science but my area of expertise is human computer interaction
and I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study because I'm working with voice systems
so good luck I guess we should talk about giving advice though what type of advice do you think you'd give to a parent? to a parent?
the thing is when you're a kid and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want
and choosing from my experience I thought I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want
but I don't know at the same time you have to decide what is important about the school the size of it or I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change
I know very few people that started in one field and stayed with it they I think that's what you just said having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school I think that's much more important I'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs that some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer but some of the larger small schools I guess around three or four thousand students can offer a broader range of curriculums and things
so if the kid does change they don't have to transfer or they don't have to I don't know they don't have to give up years of credit transfer and things that's disruptive
I normally and parents hate to hear this because I actually teach college I hate to talk to the parents one of the reasons is because the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and I always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation because you'll get better grades
I think most employers would probably rather hire a three six in history to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration
does that make sense?
I see what you're saying I always tell them that you should major in something you're going to get good grades in because that's always more important overall I don't know
give me five minutes you're at the office now? at work?
I'm just getting ready to go to lunch that's like what we were saying though would you advise a private school or a public school it would
what's the trade off there what I tell you I live in maryland and the public schools here are pretty good
I teach at a public school actually and I know that the s a t scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the private schools and I would full time at a public school and then right now I'm teaching part time at a catholic institution
I see and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school because I think their parents pay more and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated where at the public school I don't think as many parents are college educated and I think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious it's the minimal cost but I think you can get a good education at public or private but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private I
you have to look around at the school I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for
I think I would agree with that in fact I'm going through the same thing where in graduate school I was trying to choose
a particular institution might be better for my area
the university of small town in arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area
yet if I go to u of I or c m u or any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better but it's the same thing there's what will the name recognition get me kind of thing does it have a big ten football team or
that's usually the basic criteria is it a pac ten school
but I think I'm at the university of maryland so in this region though I go to a smaller branch of the university of maryland my diploma will still say university of maryland
it doesn't differentiate on my diploma though I would put it on my resume what program I went to but I think I'm actually at a smaller program I'm not at the big college park campus that's the big one with the football team
so I think you're right that there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition when I first was applying for graduate schools I applied to some big programs in this area like stevens institute of technology which is recognized in the northeast as one step below m I t in a sense
so it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school
and technical people know that but I I think you're right you really have to think about that for the job I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor's and when I I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs I was going to be a teacher I was just a high school teacher so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of
but then when I went for graduate work or for a new job people said to me shippensburg state where is that
and when I went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it
so I think yeah that's important I think it depends on if you want a regional job or a national job you need that first job or so out of school too
I guess another thing that concerns me is it seems like everybody today is still in that job market and where was I at? in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school but there is also a whole other dimension the growing up while you're going to school part
and actually in the midwest especially a lot of the schools like university of missouri will have a main campus like columbia which is big multi disciplinary
and they'll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field so you've really sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything
depending on your technical areas
I could see that but I know that at university of maryland where I am in a p h d program I haven't even met someone outside of my area of information systems except for
so do you have a personal computer?
we do have one in our home it's on the fritz right now because the monitor isn't working properly but it has been used tremendously mostly by my children for playing games
however the bane of our existence these days but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for reports and papers and that sort of thing that's what when this subject was mentioned to us I went that's all I use mine for is a word processor and I haven't used it since I got out of college and that was six years ago
but it was my sister's who my sister bought it
and my father had a small business and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business and he never did
he always did everything out by hand he only had three employees
so it wasn't really worth it to him to do it
it would be worth it if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand like pay the payroll and
and there are lots of them on the market basically payroll
but you do have to research that find out what works for your system what kind do you have? it's an I b m I think it's a professional three hundred that's the digital one it's an I b m p c junior I think
that's a nice computer she uses it now my sister to she moved and my father wasn't using it she took it with her because she needed it to do
so she took it with her
don't blame her she just finished up her bachelor's degree
so I don't know if she's going to even use it anymore it's
encourage her to try other things because I am I work in a school system and I teach writing and we use the computers a great deal for word processing because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer as you probably found out yourself
but I also am sponsoring a literary magazine and we're doing our entire layout on the computer because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have a publishing program
that's neat that's a very good use so it is wonderful
once you get into some of the programs that are out now you can do so much with them that you don't do until you really make yourself use them
I know there's got to be a lot of uses but it's just you have to have a need
you have to make yourself do it but you have to have a need I really have no need for it at all
I work for digital equipment
and we have a powerful computer down at work
so you don't need a personal one? and I still really don't do that much as you say play games on it
they're great for playing games my brother
my son is studying electronic technology and he's been able to do things on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his reports and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way
and I guess it if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful but unless it is I guess it's kind of a waste I know some people who just they just went through a course and took the electronic grafting course drafting not grafting but drafting course that's fascinating the c a d
I knew what you meant and that's really neat you can do graphs on it too
but this is one step above it but it's actual drafting and I always
you can do wonderful design it's really especially when anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering drawing you have to be so precise and the computer does it all for you
so it was really neat I wanted to go to that course but my boss wouldn't pay for it
I'm I'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it I'll be needed
because I didn't want to go do it myself because I didn't think I was really going to use it
I got this cough I've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and I went outside with no coat on it was bad
what a change? it was a big change
you couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot and then again I picked up a cold
but I'm doing all right getting over it
that's good so I don't even know how much personal computers cost nowadays
they vary tremendously because you can get because they're the ones that were made a few years ago have come down in price significantly I've seen them for five and six hundred dollars but they have much less memory and capable of much less they can't do your drafting and your graphs and all of that
you can't do very much on them
it's just that you have to be able to get your program in and many of the programs are so big
they take up so much space that you don't have any place then to work you don't have any bytes left
but if you want to go into one that's really useful you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much and we've ours is not quite that powerful and so we are limited which may be one reason why you do run into limitations on yours?
some things we can't do but then we haven't needed to either
but we've been able to do what we can that's neat that you even reach the limits of yours I haven't even begun to reach the limits
but I mine is not as good as a p c junior junior
ours is a commodore one twenty eight
and it's not quite as useful not quite as powerful they say that commodore has made a good p c for the price though so
they did that's very true that's very true they did very competitive I don't even know much money my sister spent on hers but I just thought it's going to be a waste she's not going to use it
sounds that you were right she likes it she gets to write her reports but like I say she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted
and she could have bought a typewriter also a typewriter with memory would have been fine
it's all she uses it for
I think it might have a spelling editor on it I'm not sure
it it if it doesn't she could easily put it on
that's the one great thing about it
which program did you use? did you use word perfect? I really don't it was six years ago
she pretty much set it up she goes you make your file and then you can edit it
I used the one at work a lot matter of fact anything I've had to write from now on I had to god forbid write a couple of resumes and I was just great and all you have to do is just put it in the spelling check mode
and I don't even have to look my words up anymore
they're great you're right I guess we've spent our time
I need to go help my daughter do something so this has been fun talking to you good good luck
I really haven't seen any movies lately so when the computer picked this one I was a little bit surprised but I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about six months but the last movies that I've seen were probably on video
that's we rent a lot of videos too
we saw I have two little babies and we saw one movie recently and that was the terminator movie which I didn't like after all
I haven't seen the terminator movie and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff
I don't either it on all the advertisements arnold schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie he doesn't he maims them
he maims them pretty good doesn't he?
I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part in the movie
I saw sleeping with the enemy I saw it
I haven't seen that one yet couple weeks ago I rented it and watched it and I was pretty disappointed in it because I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense
and I was pretty disappointed in it
it's a good movie but I guess that they built me up too much for my expectations in it there
with all the commercials and everything
I haven't that's one we want to see I want to see dances with wolves
but we haven't seen that one yet either I haven't seen it either but I've heard that it's real long that it's a good movie but it's long three hours
that's what I heard too we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it that's right
so we saw the movie with sylvester stallone oscar that's right oscar
supposed to be his debut in comedy
which was an interesting movie but not very funny I know my daughter saw that and she liked it so did she?
it was an amusing movie
it I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to just at the house watching it with no one else around
so and of course I get to watch all these movies like look who's talking and look who's talking too and because I have a ten year old so we watch a lot of movies around that category that she can watch
my son just turned two and so the little mermaid is now our favorite movie we seen the little mermaid too
little mermaid and peter pan are his two favorites that we've got
and I think there's some good disney movies fixing to come out on video shipwrecked
I didn't hear that was coming out it's fixing to come out on video and I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out
they just had the rescuers movie but
that was a disney movie wasn't it I think I heard that was just out he doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet but he likes to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the movie
I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater
I tell you ever my kids are just small babies and I tell you we really want to go a lot
and there's so much out on video now that it's almost the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it sometimes that's right and then they go to the dollar movies
that seems to happen I noticed that dances with wolves was playing at the granada theater
and someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie I thought that might be kind of fun to do that does sound fun
and of course you need a baby sitter for that definitely but I'd really like to get out to the movies more often course it's so expensive now too that you can't hardly afford it
I know we get discount tickets where my husband works but other than that it just seems like it's so expensive and then the popcorn and everything else you almost can't afford to do it no matter what that's right
although we did actually get we went on vacation couple months ago and we got to go see what about bob?
that was kind of a funny movie with richard dreyfuss and bill murray
that was fun I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie
richard dreyfuss is a psychiatrist and bob is his patient and bob follows him on vacation it's that's the one where they burn down the house or something the house explodes?
that's the one another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is I just forgot the title of it it's supposed to be a real scary one here's another one that I've seen I saw I can't remember the title of it either must have left an impression
got any problems on mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there?
I don't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer I'm afraid you're right
one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought something's happens on mockingbird and then heard yells and screams and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house
and they had stopped a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back by your house? on my house
so I'm very much aware of crime in the cities and the concern about it that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening it was
I kept hearing noises and so I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage so I got my gun and walked through the house into the garage there was no one there but I wanted to be sure
is plano beginning to experience the kinds of things that are more common in the urban area? unfortunately that's too bad
I think as any city grows up you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there
and I think fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on spring creek but we've lived here sixteen years and now you can tell the change for sure
I was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen plano grow from what was really a small town to a city
central expressway with all the stores and the restaurants and the convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by and
I was appalled to read the other day about the shooting on the tollway that couldn't be too far from you neither
it's farther west of me
I live over near white rock lake but
it was really frightening to think that it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth
I never thought about someone robbing those but apparently they do I don't know how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but
it just doesn't seem possible does it it's kind of stupid isn't it
but I guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go
and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in the theft and the violence that we see I think you're right although I think that may be an excuse for people too
it is convenient isn't it?
I didn't know what I was doing
that kind just like the old alcohol idea and I think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money
and I work in south dallas for the dallas school system
and where do you work?
do you know where oakland and hatcher are? I think I do is that amelia earhart school there?
this is over near lincoln high school just not far off south central expressway that's a pretty rough area there isn't it?
it is a pretty rough area we're over by fair park
and you watch the people there are marvelous b m w s and mercedes and cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns
and the kids see that and they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day running for drug dealers if definitely that area that's big time
big time there sure is it surely is I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself
I'm careful that's the worst neighborhood in the whole area
it's a little scary sometimes and I manage the do you do exercise?
I do I guess it actually changes I do a number of different things simply walking with my wife and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle
and then moving up I run in the mornings
not every morning it probably averages about two days a week
and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn't quite exercising but it's along the lines
how about yourself that's a hard question to answer because I do physical things but I don't always set out for them to be exercise
I walk with my parents occasionally nothing's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule and I play racquetball but I haven't since I've been out of school I don't have anywhere to do that but that's going to start soon again
and I play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise
because I really don't like to exercise I think that's the basic point of it is I don't enjoy it if I know that it's exercise
but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity I don't mind
so I have to disguise it it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it that's right that's kind of the same thing for me I have to not know that it's exercise so I can do it
so you look at it more as a task if it's exercise it's a task
I don't want to do anything I have to do
I see I'll voluntarily clean the bathroom but I won't do it if I have to do it
I'm thirty two years old which is probably different than yourself I'm twenty two
and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise
my job at texas instruments I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that I don't get any exercise doing that
and plus there's a build up of stress
so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner and I need to go out in the morning and run or I'll just get nuts
so that's kind of a motivator so even though I can look at it as a task I get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying I'm lowering my chance of heart attack and that type stuff eating right and no cholesterol and all that
that all I do all that we I'm sure I will do I'm doing that more and more than I used to
I'm getting better about this knowing that I need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage
is it a pleasure for you or are you
it's a something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable
I do that at the end of the day and it takes during that time the stress from the day goes away I get to share whatever I did with my wife and vice versa
going to the gym is actually something different than and the running and I enjoy that too
year I've been running since high school on track teams and the like
so running I'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more
and you don't think about the pain of it you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that
and that's no fun and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people that's I never got past that stage
the weight lifting on the other hand is actually I think I look better
I'm not a huge person I'm just a regular looking guy but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is attractive so that pays also that's good
so I guess that aspect of that takes away the work with my wife which is nice
I love her I enjoy being with her
I guess that's one thing but also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles that's it I do the occasional push up and sit up I haven't really brought myself to go to the gym because that's very stressful to me
because I felt real competitive there and I need to find some place I could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
I don't let that bother me but that's something that comes with time too
I'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent
it's your own you're struggling against your own body weight
you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow
and you can actually get a good I know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups that's a good idea but I do have my ride we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house
is that right I'll do those once in a while just at eleven thirty when love connection's on and I can't sleep
I'll get up and stair step for half an hour that's funny
it's pretty healthy but I don't have a regular plan that's
I need to get started on that
maybe not I'd say at twenty two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting the exercise otherwise
when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan
and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle when you add a plan to your life something else has to go away
and that's the hard decision is if I'm going to run in the mornings what do I trade it off for the answer's sleep sleep
if I'm going to walk at night what do I trade it off for star trek
or it's always trade offs and as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to replace this thing
it's not just exercise but anything it's very hard
and I don't think you should worry about not having a program yet that'll come some day when I
I guess if you care or if your future wife gives you a reason to care which helps I hope so
I think we covered it sounds good
nice talking with you craig you too have a nice day you too
it's hard topic because is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like I do
and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or state school kindergarten all the way up to high school
but you're excluding high level education I am
actually I think that higher level education I don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that I'm sure are struggling but it's the job that the high school and the grade schools are doing that I see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if I lived in new york city or washington d c I would seriously consider moving if I had a child I wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that
I know down here the schools are I don't know they rate I moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio and the schools down here rate bottom ten percent across the country and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on that's really too bad because it's giving some people unfair advantage our high school up here is like a junior college in florida what we learned
that was my experience going through junior high up there when I came down south for high school I was just repeating what I'd already done because we were so far advanced
and I'd been in a parochial school before junior high and even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
so I like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier and then you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over they have that down there that
they talk about it and there are a few in I live in a big metroplex and some of the better parts of the metroplex the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools but it's like if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art there's no point in I'm an engineering student and if I have to go take art classes I'm not going to use them and through high school I could have gone so much further if I'd gone to a school that was directed that's true I was fortunate I'm a technician and we had a vocational electronics in our high school
in high school so when I went to my first year of tech school I had a very easy time because our high school had a good program
I think the schools today they're just overrun they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many of the kids don't care I find that in the cities it's more like the kids go there so socialize not really to learn and
and the parents send them there because they're supposed to plus it gets them out of their hair and I also find that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent I think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage
and there's some kids that want to go learn but most of them just want to go play I could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world I can see where that wouldn't be very good for a kid he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're get away from me I've had a terrible day so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
that's true I'm wondering with the boom down here it's not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward are they going to move to mexico?
I don't know about that but a lot of the industry up in the northern states is moving south
and I'm wondering if that's going to have any effect on what you see now we're behind down here on the
I say we because I live here if that might not turn around in the next fifteen twenty years maybe they'll bring their good schools with them if the industry comes hopefully they'll promote good schools
because I know the town that I come from the large I b m plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one plus for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists
you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you
you hope you hope I think I don't know I just think it's a duty of the parent to do that my parents always helped me and I don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in I can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader I don't see where she's going to have much time for them so I don't know it's just
I guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it who's supposed to make the change the state the federal government where's the money supposed to come from is it I don't know actually I think it should be the city level and a system level really to find out and to see what they need and not overinflate it
what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got? if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go wait a minute
we're in a recession here our town didn't pass the school budget this year for the first time in many many years just because people are in the recession and they're even though we've enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa
starts hitting closer to home but I always it's all money this a couple other topics we had talked about was crime it's all money based what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school who knows maybe we need some more catholic schools support the church instead they seem to have done a good job in the past in some places you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school so
they're a lot more strict I don't
you have to learn you aren't given the chance to screw off all the time I don't know if I would do that to my child though so pretty much though I don't have any good ideas or anything that would contribute this isn't a subject that I think a lot about because I'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
I know I'm in the the only reason I asked about secondary schools or advanced education is because down here going to the university of texas the education I'm getting is kind of shoddy for a public school is it?
I don't think I'm getting what I should but in texas it's next to free because they pay so much of it it's state supported that
but at the same time it's not like going to m I t my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of m I t and it's really too bad
but that's I don't know I think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and junior colleges that don't have the background for an m I t kind of curriculum so so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's university of vermont we also have some two year college there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you
there did I reach the dallas area? I beg your pardon? did I reach the dallas area?
you've reached dayton ohio dayton ohio I'm from north carolina
you're from north carolina where in north carolina? in raleigh
raleigh so my name is fernando my name's mary
fernando glad to know you so do you how'd you find out about this?
I was visiting my son down in dallas and he works for t I
but his wife has a contract with t I and that's how we learned about it because I'm down at n c state
and so I took a class and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes so are you ready?
I'm ready let's get started
so what do you think that what do you think we can do to solve the crime in america?
if I knew that I'd be a very wealthy person but what are the steps?
you have to see the way I look at it you have to think first of all why or has crime increased and if so why has crime increased? the problem is that what happens is that as you go from the country to a city crime always increases?
because in the country people still respect the property of other people
and so as and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city
what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they rush to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other people have and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go get some stuff steal it and then just resell it it's easy you said the magic word there which one? drugs
and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased that's the main reason I think everywhere because you have deaths you have murders and you have people stealing other people's stuff and that's a lot of it has to do with drugs
it doesn't have to do the thing is that it's like you might be standing somewhere and let's say you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these twenty four hour gas stations joints
and somebody walks in there with a gun they're going to want the money and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs they don't want the money so they can do something else with it
they don't want the money for food that's for sure and so
but something that many people don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids because I'm a retired educator
and in fifty one and fifty two the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on
so it's a problem that's been around for over forty years and we're just really now trying to figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge there's a song that I know which says it's like in nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america and their figures are so it's like compared to weapons or stuff like that you're spending nothing on crime in the country itself what you're doing is you it's like you have other things you have the aids we're going to try to solve the aids problem while some people are getting killed here and there and then
and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction
but those people never get caught the people that I
that's right they'll never get caught their theory is that if I'm surrounded and I'm going to be caught I'm going to try to find my way through and they're not going to take me alive
but I have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me
that's right but they'll it's like of course I might be the leading drug dealer here but you won't find me dealing in drugs there's no connection between me and the people that were caught that's right
that's right and they one person doesn't know the other person down the line
but the guy at the very top the one who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure and had the political pull to keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing
because it sure is monstrous in this country I was at a party on saturday and this guy comes over he goes how you doing he started talking to me and this guy was from jamaica
and he's got his little brother selling drugs
and he goes I just came up here to work and I go you did you make very good money up here he goes I make a lot of money he goes and in the movie good fellows
might did you see it?
I only heard about it in one part the guy goes out of jail and within two months he has all his house payments gone everything paid
and he had enough money to it's like those guys at one point they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it
really even in our prison systems they're finding that they're having drugs smuggled into them that was also in the movie mary been nice talking with you we've been talking for five minutes?
I beg your we've been talking for a little bit I appreciate the call I enjoyed talking with you same here
tell me about your home
it's an older home it was made back in the early sixties it's a pier beam house got three bedrooms one bath and that just makes me scream that's pretty tough what area do you live in?
I live in houston I see is that pretty typical for your area?
for the neighborhood I'm in
this is one of the more established neighborhoods that sounds real interesting I live in a suburb of dallas and I live in the basic three bedroom two bath home so at least I have two bathrooms that's not so bad but it's pretty typical for the area as well I've always been interested in older homes personally I think you can end up doing more with them what about yard space? do you have a big lot or anything like that?
the whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre I see
about half of that about a quarter acre of that I've got a garden that's nice because I have just a very small you know those basic tract houses like that we have a very small yard and I do have garden but it's extremely small but it seems like though for your area that is sort of different in a big city like that most houses would be sort of like what we live in just a basic tract house
in the newer neighborhoods and development communities the houses are so close together
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow that's exactly right that's the way we are one thing we have that we really enjoy here is we have a hot tub in the back so we have quite a few parties and seems like everyone that lives around us ends up hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone so that's true that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it is the houses are too close together but it's fine for now hopefully eventually we'll move in a larger home the only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that so are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home? because it seems like then that they built the homes much larger is that true?
and they've got better closet space
new houses that I've seen that's really it that's a plus at least we do have three walk in closets here so that's maybe not so typical but
it helps a bunch it really does except when you have to fill them up and then you get those visa bills in and
anyway anything else about the area about can you compare yourself to any thing around there
most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical this whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty five so it's
everybody has got a pretty good size yard
I got probably the biggest if not the biggest yard I've got pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood
that's nice that is nice but too the only bad thing too is that then you have to keep up you have the yard to deal with
I enjoy that though and
do you you must have more time than I have I'm sitting out here right now we had this terrible rain and I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten and it seems like that's I almost wish I was in an apartment or something
it's rained I don't know do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time? do you know?
we can after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes they'll get a little master recording on this
can you tell me anything else about the house are you working on it? do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation?
this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice that's nice the town that I came from is a older town it the typical homes there are early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds
and I renovated a house there and that was so much fun there if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy five to hundred years old you're just nobody practically and that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline and was considered typical for that area so it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just a very square little box and there's not a whole lot you can do with it but anyway
living in the city has some advantages that's true
if given the choice I'm getting out I have lived in a small town for this town was less than ten thousand people and it was about sixty miles south of dallas and I didn't move out of there until I was twenty seven and that was just so I love the big city I had lived in a rural area for so long so I've enjoyed it but it can get kind of tough it's like a rat race sometimes
that's just something I'll never adapt to I don't want to be a part of the rat race I want to be basically just kind of left alone
if I want to sit around and mess with my garden I'll mess with my garden
if I want to work in the flower beds it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well I
very much I really do enjoy that but I haven't planted anything yet or I usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo but I haven't done that yet I've had finals this week so I'm just kind of trying to stick in with that
but since that's over with now maybe I can get this yard in shape do you do a lot of gardening?
landscaping is more than the gardening
in the garden I've got my beans peas
I've got some onions out tomatoes
I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year I never have much luck with tomatoes I do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the bugs get on them so easily and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that so the only thing that I use is soap I spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them but I don't have luck with that tomato plant so I hate to spray them with anything what do you do? do you have any tips you could give me?
my favorite one is to put dust
and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time that's true that's true my dad is a farmer I've heard him talk about that forever I guess it works but you have to really wash your vegetables after that so it won't make you sick let's see what else do you do to your house?
I've done some rewiring on it
eventually if we stay here I'm going to have to rewire the entire house do you plan on adding any rooms or you have enough space you could probably do that or is it
I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms that's tough do you not have a half bath
not even a half bath that's rough the house that I used to live in had one bath and a half and that was even just with two people that was a pain the only thing that saves it with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times so that it's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning that's good
that could account for a lot of marital problems I think you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
it doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on and you're both fighting over the mirror
that's right it does not make for a happy situation that's true do you have any children? I've got one one child and they enjoy where they're living?
we'll he's nine months old so he doesn't know I guess he's a big help out in your garden he likes to dig around a little bit his mother comes in and says why did you let him play in the dirt
I guess he's enjoying himself that's right it's healthy why not
he was eating the dirt I wouldn't worry about it it won't hurt them I was a big dirt eater supposedly when I was a child and I turned out okay
so don't worry about it just let him enjoy himself you think that you want to move away from the big city?
that's what I've always I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people so you're just the opposite from me you want to go back to that
after we got married we ended up moving to the houston area are you from texas?
you are so it's not that's true houston in itself is a pretty tough place
how did you like that topic?
I don't know I've got mixed feelings about the topic do you? I don't
I'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know I agree with it I think a company should be able to test any employee any time they see fit
I just don't think there's a place in our environment in the work force for drugs or alcohol either
I don't believe in drugs or alcohol but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the t cat they were talking about drug testing us
and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine and we found it belittling you did?
I can sort of understand that but not being a teacher as you are I was not quite as sympathetic as I probably would have been if kay were a teacher or something that's true but
but then at the same token I'm not against because I look at airline pilots bus drivers people that really have other peoples lives in their hands truck drivers that's right that's right
it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol that's right
and I think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read and but
in those areas I really do believe that maybe we should clean up our house I think so too
I agree with it I know kay's company they started it couple of years ago and so many of the people even the professional people they were so against them doing that and I thought to me it's quite simple you either need a job or you don't the job is what provides all of your needs and if they say you can't do this work I'd say I agree I won't do that and I think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first
I think it's just like anything else a new concept as I said if I have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted it is I can see where you would think that is belittling I'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that
but at the same token in education we can't do random drug testing on kids that's true
their rights are protected you bet they would really raise a stink if that was to happen what
but if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids when we see them and they're under the influence
I agree with that I wouldn't be opposed to it at all it's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it tooth and nail
that's true but lynn I've enjoyed talking with you I don't know how long we're supposed to carry on a conversation do you?
it's three minutes and the clicker comes in when it's time to we'd better keep talking because I've not heard it have we have you heard it?
anyway we both sort of agree on it don't we about random testing
do we agree or unless it's not me listen here we go again if you agree that
I believe that truck drivers and people that have even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands if they come in stoned or they come in drunk and there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk is that right?
you just don't think of that happening with teachers
and he I really don't when I think of drug testing I'm thinking of the outside of education
we are as susceptible a society as anybody else
I know that but you don't think of that first hand normally and
did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation isn't that mind boggling
it was on the news tonight it's mind I agree with you I know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same good qualities as anybody else
then I think if push came to shove I'd probably be drug tested
because it does you think the benefit would be greater than the
because as I say I'm sitting there fussing and fussing and yet I know of one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as out and that was in your children's high school isn't that amazing
and my children brought it to my attention I never was there to see it if it was true there I'm sure it's true with just about every school there is
because they represent a pretty good
and that's not giving a good example to students they don't need that example but
do you have any children? I don't you don't
do you? I have one a five year old daughter
did you ever have her in child care? I do she was at a private I stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born
and then I had her at a private sitter for two two and a half years after that
and how did you choose that sitter? she was referred to me by a couple of people and she turned out to be wonderful I couldn't have asked for anything better I don't think
I didn't want to send her straight to a day care
and even though she was that old I still didn't want her to go to a day care
and this lady you would think it was her own she's real good
it's hard to find people like that it is and now I have got her in a montessori school
and she's really really doing good and learning a lot and actually I've started working up there in the afternoons too
that's neat I guess I'm going to quit as soon as the school season's over but I really enjoyed being with her up there I hate it for her she has to stay that much longer but
do they have classes for them during the summer too? they go year round teach them
now in the summer they have a lot of field trips
there's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one and stuff like that it's a lot more lax but they still go through all their curriculum as usual
what kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there? I my husband and I both went we kind of give her the third degree
I'm glad to hear that we went over to her house so we told her we just told here we'd be over that day we didn't tell her when so that way I didn't think the house would be cleaned or anything for me specifically
and she had a daughter and I want to say her daughter was six or seven right around first second grade and at the time she kept one other child about a four year old but it was only a part time basis so we went over there and we questioned her about what she fed them and what she did with them during the day and just how she treated them how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that
and we really seem to be pleased with her and
did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision?
and she still loves her to death when they see each other they just love each other to death and she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter either making her clothes or buying her things
so we're real real lucky but so she stayed with her about roughly two years and she had to go back to work they had some other expenses that came up so she had to go get a real job
get a real job full time so
so what made you decide to put her in a montessori school? I checked a lot of places out the kinder cares and the stuff like that
and I live in garland
and there's this montessori school that's nearby and it had been recommended by some friends of ours but it's an older place and so I checked out all the new places that were near us and then I checked that place out and even though it was older it was real comfortable and kind of homey
and they didn't just play all day long I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went and or interviewed at they did a lot of play work and stuff and then they almost all of them had a montessori section
and I thought that must be pretty good if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into their school
and they made sure they pointed it out but after I looked at this place and I took randi with me just about to every place one place I think I didn't take her
and I just kind of let her go see what she felt like doing
and that place if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them so I felt more comfortable at that place that's the true test
and she was real comfortable and she has really really done good I it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her
but she seems to me to be pretty quick and smart and she's already reading and writing and stuff like that that's good and she just turned five last month that is good then
I think so I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time but
especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years in school I wanted to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months because I know she's going to have to face that and here we go
that's right I just hate that but so you don't have any children do you have any nieces or nephews then?
I have a nephew he's a little brat
he goes to a really crummy day school my sister's not real bright but he's always sick he has always got some kind of cold or something and I don't know I don't think this place is a very good place for him
it's just kind of convenient and she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else just easy to get them there and that's a shame
I don't think she checks things out very well which really surprises me that's scary
it is scary I was petrified I know
I would be too that's I don't know that's just it and that's why I don't mind paying more
I don't know I just feel
too many horror stories out there that and that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is because I know what's really going on
that's right I think that's an ideal situation because you don't know because at her school as soon as you drive up it's got a circular type drive they sit and they have car callers and some kid goes out and gets the kid and it's time to go
at first that always kind of bothered me not bothered me but I thought I'd like to see what she's doing
but now that I'm there it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle when their parents come
and it's hard to get them out and a lot of parents have places to go and things like that
that's right and it's late at night so now it doesn't bother me at all but
is that where the over there off of I'm not sure what the street is is it near country club and all sixty six that one that's set back in the woods?
I've seen the signs that's it
but I've never actually seen the place itself
it's pretty set far back off the road
it and that's something I like too
because a lot of those places are like the one over here on seventy eight skaggs
that little kinder care whatever it is?
it's right there on which this is on a highway too but it's set back enough to
there's a difference I would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could go in and get one
that's right or a car accident and that was one of the places I had checked out
and it was brand new when I checked it out and of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there but I that I didn't base everything on that
because that all wears off that's right that's exactly right you get some kids in there and it's over quick
but I've been real pleased knock on wood I'm scared to death her going to public school
I don't know I I do know why because drugs and everything else I would be too
and they talk about how soon they start that and that scares me
I know it is scary you're just with them
do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs? they've had police officers come in and talk to them about it
but of course they still have no concept of what in the world drugs are but
and what to do when they're faced with it but I just think of her next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with ten year olds isn't that sixth grade
and that's a big gap
it is and I can honestly see the peer pressure there
and that just terrifies me to death and stuff I can see it too
those kids getting snatched and I'm probably a little too over protective
but nowadays you have to be nothing wrong with that you do if
I don't think there's anything wrong with that I at first thought when I didn't have kids I was going how can you be so protective? but it's easy now now you understand that's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own you'll understand that's exactly right and I do
but are you married?
are y'all planning on having kids? or
we'd like to that's good
because they're really neat it's just
what is your practice as far as budgeting? do you manage the money?
we talk about it but I'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and tries to somehow make the ends meet which I see that's how kind of I am too are you married? you are
I think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and I have to spend only what he earns it
I don't mind the spending it's just that trying to get what you need out of what you have that seems to be our challenge I don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when I spend more than what's coming in I have to go back to work
I see so I manage it
I'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary do you actually follow a budget?
we pretty well do several years we didn't and we found that we just weren't making the most of what we had and so we set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for just our bills and then what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs that's pretty much the way we did in the past I would say at this point our children are grown and so I really don't have the obligations there any more that we have to balance to get things together for them
and I really just keep very good records and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and I try to keep my mastercards and things paid currently
I don't always succeed at that I usually keep one with a low interest rate and I put things on there that I think I'm not going to get to
and then I have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
so I'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead
and we do not buy us new cars do you get into car
we had new cars always until about four years ago my husband owned his own company and it went under and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that we do have a used car he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car do you think that it's wiser to buy used? we do for us very much so in fact we are in a position that most of our friends wonder why we just don't go to a new car whatever and I said look you guys are all into car payments
we haven't had car payments for so many years I love it this way and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked and it has eighty two thousand miles on it
and we kept saying wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it believe it or not we did we found one one newer
the worst part is it's the same color
and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the same and I said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again
that's right I said we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it
and it's an eighty five and so I said this was a cinch we paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on
this is for all the long running back and forth on interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably
do you buy from dealers or from individuals? generally from dealers and it depends because I don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual unless we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell
we were going up to a larger one but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer we always make a deal we have walked out of more dealerships saying don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you want to bring him right away you're going to get one shot at us
we will and they say you're kidding I this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't want to hear about taxes
so I own a p c a t at my home
I could never justify owning a personal computer at home that's quite an expense to look for who is this what do you use yours at home for? that's actually a good question my wife works out of our home she has an office and in fact she sits in the office and she uses it to compose and print out letters
now so that's a very regular use of it that she has
and in addition to that I tinker around with it I'm a computer scientist
and so I write programs to do little things I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special and also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of remind me of things remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like
I'm a electronics tech years ago t I sent me to their computer school down in austin
so I learned to repair one but I never really learned to operate one that's a key thing actually that's a there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today that just require no programming
so that in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
but I think you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage whatever your issue is then there really
space is a handicap with me I live in a motor home I see
and I'm preparing for retirement I see congratulations on that
and I'm not to far from it another year and a half actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap
but just like the computers
remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars the calculators you mean
calculators I beg your pardon they sure do I actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a whole brand new computer not a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars you're kidding
including a printer? actually I wasn't including a printer but you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred a hundred? a respectable one?
of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them but that does amaze me the prices had plummeted you can buy just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty eighty eight for about two hundred dollars
and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty
what is a good brand a inexpensive that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs so there's probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called computer shopper
it's a big magazine it's twelve inches the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side
and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages but the magazine is full of these computer mail order houses and they're all competing with each
so you just flip through there until you find a eighty eighty eight computer it's the original p c so it's we call the t I an I b m p c compatible and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty five dollars which is amazing to me
and you mix and match and then you do it by mail order but there's no real brands it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board
I see how do you go about getting one of those a catalogs? they're available in the b daltons that type of thing
you'll notice that although it's a magazine it's large and like I said it's about an inch thick
getting back to the p c s I'll tell you I first of all I don't like a machine that's smarter than me
and secondly I did learn this much about computers they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten in binary that's right there's great
anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes
one and one equals ten that's great
course it's kind of an inside joke you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary I understand that's great that's a good joke
so do you work with a computers at t I? I did for years and then I was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
now I type that one but I don't use it anymore
I just recently started using one in connection with my work
I keep track of an inventory here
and of course that is where a computer is very handy I agree
and it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated
I'm with the q r a lab qualification and evaluation I see that's fascinating
so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated
and they're dated so I have to keep up with them and it's very handy doing it on the computer
I just run a printout every week and it puts me right up to date what I have to do what I have to ship what I should be expecting to be returned so a it is handy
and I must admit that up until I did start using one I had very little interest in computers
but they are amazing they certainly are so let's see so I guess with respect to the question I guess we've kind of covered it
I think we did nice little conversation with you jack
mike you take care now good day good luck to you thank you same to you my name is leslie
I'm jennifer and where are you from?
pennsylvania nice I'm from dallas texas
that's neat did you understand what it was for what we television shows?
that sounds good I don't watch too many but we can try it
are you ready to start?
sure am just a minute
I guess we're recording now
what are your favorite television shows? I don't really watch too many t v shows other than occasionally I'll turn on donahue because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here
so if there's no one else around it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something I'll turn that on but just for the conversation factor I think and then I think I enjoy when I catch it designing women sometimes
I love that show do you?
that is great it's fun and then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called good and evil
I heard they just canceled that
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show it is a real different one it's different I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it but
have you seen the show called home front? I haven't watched that
it's really good I think it's on tuesday nights from ten to eleven
and it's set in post world war two times and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through it's really interesting
it's kind of like a nighttime soap opera type thing sounds neat
it is it's really well written is that on what station?
I don't even know to tell you the truth what other shows do you like?
I prefer oprah winfrey to donahue
she comes on later and I usually have kids around so I don't end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it I guess
I did watch soap operas but I work full time now and can't catch those anymore except when I'm home sick and now when I watch them I think why did I ever watch those? that's right they're stupid
so when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day but not anymore that can happen so do you know of any other shows in the even or something that you enjoy?
tonight I'm looking forward to seeing golden girls that's always fun I like that show
and if I can stay up late enough I like to catch saturday night live every now and then
and right now we're watching a penn state football game because that's where we live
it's exciting we're winning so that's really exciting I think I also course like to catch the news during the evening hours
but it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time so usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in
we watch c n n in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast
we'll catch our news that way watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like what have you seen interesting on oprah winfrey lately?
lately I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule
I can't remember the last time I saw it it's been a while I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not
I don't know sometimes they come on and say that's right
today on c n n they were talking about something like this about learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing helping them get a data base for words
it was really interesting it is interesting
do you work for texas instruments? just doing this as a fund raiser for our church
that's nice so it kind of makes it easy to do a little something for it
because we've talked to a lot of people from texas it seems and we thought maybe they work for dallas
have you taken anything back lately that you've bought?
the only thing we've taken back recently are plants shrubbery that were guaranteed why?
and we had no problem with it
we got our money back do you think that consumer goods are generally getting better or worse in quality?
I believe they're better I do too I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time but I don't I believe that they're better now I think so I don't think they're shoddy not as shoddy electrical appliances I think are pretty good reliable however I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it
and I don't like it very well when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out on one side
did you return it? I had moved away
I had taken the first one back I didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get anything but just moderately warm took it back and the people told me that's the way it's supposed to be and I fell for it and when I got this one it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side
so either you or your husband can be warm but not both also I took an iron back after having it only one year
I figure anybody that is dumb enough to iron needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
did they replace it? without even any question but I think it was the store wal mart
wal mart I was going to say it must have been wal mart
and have you been buying any clothes lately? any new clothes?
I haven't bought any new the last thing I bought was a dress last summer and the buttons turned on it over the winter the buttons tarnished slightly and I have not gone back about it that was poor quality I think I think it is too and it was an expensive dress I wondered if it weren't expensive
it was and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever
that's right that's what I think too and the chain belt loop half of it raveled out
and that was a leslie faye dress and it was over a hundred dollars you spent that much on your dresses?
I don't usually but I did that one you're really divulging very personal information
but I think it should have been better than that for that money is what I mean of course I do too I believe that we've been talking about five minutes
I think so and norma it is just wonderful to talk to you good talking to you too I've enjoyed it you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time
we'll be talking to you later
what do you think the major cause of air pollution
the major cause up here is I live right on the ocean so it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland
but the major cause here is the car pollution we don't have too much industrial pollution
car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that I can really put my finger on here that isn't the same in the washington area because we don't have any major industry except for government and services and the transportation situation is such that all the car pollution is absolutely awful also the worth of the hub of three airports in this general area there is national dulles and then baltimore washington and it interestingly some of the information I've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from airplanes is extraordinary is that so?
I didn't know that and that's always something that you don't think about
most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution but the apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor
I would think so I guess it talked about all types of pollution I just read something the other day at least in the boston paper there were three things that come to note one is that the carbon fluorides that are being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer and again and now they've located another one or rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere so so I'm quite concerned I don't think it's involved any longer with hair sprays or those
from what I understand it's air conditioning units and we certainly turned into an air conditioned society society has especially recently
I know in florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned and I do quite a bit of business in washington and you know what it's like here
it's quite is the it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned and and I guess refrigerators are the same way we just had the they release that that's right so solutions to this would be I
improved I guess to me the first thing is I wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights
this is so basic it's human rights in the sense but in terms of demanding it's just not caused but demanding that we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses planes that something can be done I can't imagine that
I if we can't send people to the moon that we can't improve these things
I think that it can be done simply because we've every car now in america that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter converter
and no lead gas came to the pumps and that's been done there's the lead pollution that problem essentially was licked
and I think that there are solutions and that for buses
certainly we don't even need a research anymore it's just a matter of passing the law and passing the law depends on how heavy the automobile lobby is that's right and also to make it economically feasible and also in buses that's right that's right I don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus that
the smell is awful but I was reading the other day that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes
so I guess you're better off sitting behind a bus than a car although I could never really rationalize that while I was sitting there but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels
I'm thinking of research in that direction rather than we've taken the intermediate step but I don't think fossil fuels are the answer we
up here in new england where I've right close to where I live is the seabrook nucleus site which is practically a guerilla war up here went on for years I
my daughters marched against the seabrook and I kind of
my feelings were that we needed this bridge to jump from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be
you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use
unfortunately though I think the oil companies have lied to us for years
so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left or there isn't and but with the pollution issue fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway
so you've got to look elsewhere
but it is something that's a little frightening and in fact I within our family we have said my husband I have two sons one is already in college in new england
and the other will be going in september and we just feel that when we leave this area we're going north not south
I like the mentality north and I also like the fresher air up there
that's right so that's the way we will be going
so I'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how their attitudes are
since texas and louisiana and california in that ranking order the worst pollutants in america
I read that the other day louisiana for a small state it was amazing but it's the industrial pollution I should imagine
and california seems to be taking steps you read about the fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're enforcing the smog and
but again that didn't occur without a crisis nothing will occur without a crisis even california was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue out here
the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as I'm concerned is the no smoking rules on airplanes and in restaurants
and it really is a pleasure for me although I guess smokers don't think that but that to me was pollution that's personal air pollution
that was its most personal pollution that I can think of
I definitely advance that listen I enjoyed speaking with you
and let's hope there are other people that feel the same way
something happen thank you you're welcome
I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
credit cards that's an easy topic isn't it
it is it's one we all hold dear and near I'm sure I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them
most of mine's been pretty good although I guess I'm like a lot of other people now I'm trying to pay off my credit cards and I've done pretty good at it I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want not need want
there is a big difference there's a big difference there
but most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline
I do that I do that like I said the rest of them I've been trying to pay off and get back on a cash basis except for gas
it's too easy to run into the gas station it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way and
at least that's for me
but I've talked to some who's really had some bad experience and I haven't yet not bad
that's I'm just shocked at the end of the month to see what damage I have did but I try to keep it pretty reasonable
I've been pretty lucky in that respect like I say I've been trying to not charge except for emergencies
but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards there's they have wonderful features they're there when you need them like in emergencies or whatever
and then they have bad drawbacks too high interest
it's awfully easy it's like paying twice
that's true that's true so
I try to I did switch to one sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest compared to some of the other ones
and you don't have an annual fee there and that helps we used to have several but right now we're just more or less at american express
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
that's one way to do it because that forces you to pay for it instead of saying I'll just pay on it this month pay fifteen and I know
and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time takes a long time that's right it sure does
and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax that's
of course it's been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so
I've enjoyed talking to you
I've enjoyed talking to you and maybe we'll get to talk again
you probably more up on this subject than I am but the roles that women have played in the last couple of generations that
they've entered the work force more since world war two is when they started you bet
and I think that that is very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women you bet where I've noticed it more is I'm a traveling salesperson and I have traveled most of my life and I know just especially in the last ten years and really in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling
as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers I sell sporting goods and even in our industry there was really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things I sell and even in the last five or six years we see more and more women being involved and it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things
the you see more of them leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too you bet
I have a club that I belong to on tuesday that one of the girls travels quite extensively and she says my children have two parents why not you bet that's sort of neat
so I think that's a change and I think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing I think it's the age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that women are paid less than men and they're carrying the same job responsibility
and that's a very true statement and it shouldn't be that way
that will change in the near future also I hope so
it's been changing it's been evolving but there's still an inequality in the work forces or jobs it's I've
and you hear some people say he's a man he needs that salary
they forget also I think a good argument for that is in the area of politics if a a woman congressman makes as much as a man congressman and the same as a senator or whatever
so they certainly deserve it all the way but I guess just the most significant thing changed for me again as I mentioned was just in traveling you see more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and in their business suits and going and going
and I expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good statement and I think if in the future it's even going to be more noticeable and more significant
I think it will be I another thing I read too the other day is the car designers are starting to design cars with women in mind because in the past the male bought the cars but now they're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases and that they are looking for different things in the car
the man is looking in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel can her makeup come off the upholstery you bet good point
and if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out that are self sufficient and mobile and working right now I'm self employed and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when I first started my business she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so
she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business and she still works everyday so we all do you bet
I just happen to be off today I work too enjoying it what kind of work do you do? I'm a nurse
and I work at medical treatment center which is at jupiter and arapaho married?
trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject
I don't know I'm kind of out of things you see the old cigarette ads about you've come a long way
you've come a long way baby? baby and
you think about this when it comes to a subject like that and it's really true women have come a long way and I guess we're recorded
what do you have any hobbies that you like to do?
cycling computers backpacking just about everything
I generically have millions of hobbies that's an interesting assortment
my husband is into cycling in fact he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the time I'm not quite that bad
I'm just a weekend cyclist do you do any handicraft type things I think was the question
handicraft type things whittling or
just whittle away my life I nothing like that
I do some things I've gotten into I like to decorate things and I do sweatshirts and t shirts and I've gotten to where I have started selling them at craft shows and things
that's pretty good and I have done fairly well at them I've had a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed but most of them have worked out pretty good
they my only craft work is kind of like computers and go off to the little computer club meetings and it's kind of nice because I've made money at it too considering I work for it a living but I've got a couple of articles published
it's kind of neat what does a computer club do I didn't know there were such things
just all over the place they just get around and talk techy or else half the members are really expert and the other half are really not
and we kind of help out the people who are really not you're not into hacking or whatever
I think I'm a hacker but I'm not the dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers
that's one of those sports I don't go for that's kind of interesting hobby what else did you you said you did cycling?
what was the other thing? backpacking backpacking we
I belong to a boy scout troop it beats paying united way I just donate a whole bunch of my time to the boy scouts and have fun
we have done that our two older boys were in boy scouts and my daughter was in girl scouts until just about a year ago
so we've done a fair amount of that in our spare time also
but it I that's a great thing to do really have you been backpacking anyplace exciting?
just last weekend went to davy crockett forest which is kind of out in east texas
and we go to places out in let's see what's that state north of us that state that one that one that one
and to the by fort sill there?
to a old indian fort that's out there trying to think of the name of it no memory
have you gone to fillmont with the boy scouts?
I missed out this last year I wasn't able to get the time off but maybe next year it's a good possibility I've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do
when I was a kid we'd do the equivalent thing in the high sierras that was loads of fun does your whole family like to do it for a vacation you'd go backpacking?
not quite because I'm not a whole family I'm just me you just and you volunteer for the boy scouts?
I rent my kids sometimes
it's better than owning on them and making payments on them and things like that sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea
have you said you did it in the high sierras do you ever just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack?
not recently because the boy scouts makes it so that I go once a month someplace
but there's some stuff that I want to do with sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go
which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you which seems just a tad more relaxing I probably probably
that's my other things that I like to do in my spare time I like swimming
which is in now I've done that and I also when I like something I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it
let me just start by asking what you think of this middle east affair we've got going on?
I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the middle east I have to agree with you there I think that for once we shouldn't even be at these mid east talks because with the exception of our hostages we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is just let these people fight it out
I agree we've got so many domestic problems and what does it cost these people over there
so how about the soviet union what do you think's going to happen there the break ups?
I think that's great I'm glad to see that but again I don't want to see us pour a whole lot under any circumstances because I'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them and so I'm not much in favor of it but I'm glad to see us advising them that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money that's right that's right
but I'm ready to have a president elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda even if it doesn't work at least he is somebody who is working on that problem and I haven't seen that in the last eleven years so they don't seem to have a clue all I've seen
reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of his political affairs I think bush's kind of followed suit international is important but we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed and then there's the homeless issue and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending
I agree once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the world bank as far as aid is concerned
and I think there's a limit and we passed it a long time ago I agree we've been writing off way too many country bad debts
that's another thing I don't understand is things like selling technology and even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
to me that just doesn't make any sense as much in debt as we are I know it
I don't know I think it's definitely time for a change but I don't see anybody I don't understand too why we have to have democrats and republicans and it's either one way or the other it seems to be we're turning into a black and white society you either do it this way or you do it that way and there's no in between that's right you're either liberal or you're conservative
and it obviously isn't working I think it wouldn't hurt and I know the independent party's been trying for years to get a real force in congress but you're right there's just too many issues that come up that our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a democratic issue or it's a republican issue
and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel I think we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
I agree with you of course we have the national embarrassment in our state jessie helms
and as soon as we can get of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he just lines up people against him so it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions
he's usually on the ninety eight to two side he's the one of the two that votes he's one of the two
he's very ineffective I think
let's see senators are in for six years
and when did you guys vote him into office?
unfortunately nineteen ninety you're stuck
we're stuck with him for a little while longer
but unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great I hate
I don't know about you but where I am we have an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies every day from jeans one day to business suits the next
it's pretty bad but it's true they tend to try to be real lax and supposedly the policy is like we hire these wonderful creative people and we don't want to smush their creativity we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want and you really will see people in jeans one day and business suits the next
I'm kind of that way too I work in the legal department and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
and I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like I'm doing that and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry boxes of documents around so if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents I dress down but if we're going to have a meeting where we're having the attorneys come in or other party's attorneys and stuff then I normally dress up and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff we're kind of that way too I try to I'm the same way you are I kind of try to judge from day to day I know where I am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and if I know that they're going to be there I try to really watch it and like you say really dress up
and if I know they're not I've been doing a lot of reorganization the last couple of months the same way you are
and it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress that's right that's right it is and so
as a matter of fact I thought I had one funny story when I was at t I the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse
and at that point the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned and we were there in the middle of the summer it's unair conditioned it was dusty and dirty there was a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought t I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no
and the supervisor from another area came up to us and this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there and he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there and he came up to us and he just said who's your supervisor he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts
he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it how awful it sounds like mister power hungry
just yesterday though I saw a girl in the spine out here at lewisville that had on a pair of shorts
and I don't care you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want but these were shorts that's all they were
I don't care what else you call them if they're below the knee maybe you can call them split skirts if they're above the knee they turn into shorts
and these weren't even really full ones they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were the real wide full ones and these weren't even those these were pretty short black and they were very dressy the were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice
but you don't wear shorts to work as far as I'm considered she was in violation and nobody says anything to them it's always been a big problem in lewisville in the summertime
if they just the management doesn't ever seem to want to cut off that this is wear we're going to draw the line this is shorts
and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear but
I've seen some people try to just come in over the weekend because they want to use the texteller machine
and they have said no and then during the week you see these women in the just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore
I've never seen them do it without hose they always have hose on but still they're shorts I don't care what you say they're shorts
I think t I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway
I didn't know that e d s has a very strict dress code I had a friend do they really?
I had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out for men it's particular suits the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes
it is definitely lined out women are not allowed to wear slacks you wear coordinated suits I couldn't afford to work there
and a particular kind of shoe so high heel it is spelled out
when I was looking at her materials when she first started she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff and it told about the dress code and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way t I s says no shorts and no halters I know that's it
and e d s is very particular about this hair cuts
it was like you can't have such and such facial hair no beards and just really detailed I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in I see I am more I don't know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts but I am more productive when I'm in pants
I am I work faster I get things done faster than when I'm in a dress and heels I and it's weird but I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable
the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had another person coming from washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
and she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office
and we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're out here in the warehouse you got your skid of that wooden pallet of boxes
and you're going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the boxes and then repack your skid she was so hot and miserable in the skirt you can't do that in a skirt poor soul
she finally tried to go buy a pair of pants but it was just completely miserable for her that's terrible that's terrible
I don't know I just figure sometimes I worry about if I go in in pants and I never ever ever ever go in in a pair of jeans but I'll go in in pants today I had on a pair of navy blue dress slacks and a peach colored top and not cruddy but not a dress either and sometimes I wonder if stuff like that will hold you back if you don't dress in your dress for success business suits everyday if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on but I don't know if they do or not I see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans so
some of our people in the legal department we have assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
and then there's another one who's a little younger and a little more yuppish and he's always kind of in the khaki pants and a shirt
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that's just isn't that funny
with the little suspenders or something on we've kind of had a variety there that's great
but I think a lot of times it's mainly who they're going to meet with or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are
if they're just going to be meeting with t I ers to talk about a patent kind of thing and they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual that's the smart way to do it
it really is because you're making when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in in a six hundred dollar three piece suit it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable or it would me
it's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here look at this slick guy I wonder what kind of money does he make
I can see it now it was good to talk to you it was really enjoyable
this is kind of a fun project it really is
I've done some of the other speech programs but we've never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer
so this is a little different it's kind of enjoyable I'm really looking forward to it a lot
I guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers that I find a lot of things are so specialized that I'm not sure and I look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to they can find guilt or innocence
but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate that they might leave it to somebody else who has expertise in that I agree too I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down I think the judges should or even a panel of lawyers if it got to that point might be better than just regular civil people not knowing exactly what things are from murder on up to tax stuff
because I find that I've been on a few juries and as a say I tend to be around civil cases because I've been an expert witness some and many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to come up with the fair value or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is the range of possible values or terms or how heinous was the crime
that when I only do something one two or three times I'm hardly an expert on it and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three and
and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was worth five years or twenty five that's and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime if they're that lucky sometimes or whatever the case may be and may not have any idea of what the standard punishment would be for it
and they may have some different idea it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was longer that the punishment didn't fit the crime or not long enough or whatever the case may be
I think the judges do have better knowledge of it the only thing I worry about sometimes is if you get somebody in there that has a name that is the defendant and sometimes might have more pull which that does happen
we can't say it doesn't because it does happen not everybody has the right morals sometimes people can be paid off politically or whatever the case may be
and sometimes that's not real fair either though so
one of the others things that gets me on the juries is that often in the newspaper I tend to hear two things that go on one is you often see in the headlines the big numbers
and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed by a judge or an appeals court
and that never makes the press and so when you or I as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines and we don't have again a lot of knowledge so we don't know what is really going on what is really the range of sentences or awards that are actually in the end applied
also what I don't think is fair either is when you have a rapist come in and his attorney gets his sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like assault or something or
but that doesn't make any sense to me either I know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't it's embarrassing and all this other stuff
and they're put on like they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge I don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say that was a breeze I can go out and do it again and have the same thing happen that's not right
that's where the role of juries is restricted and I'm not sure I'd want to change that aspect of it one is it's restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually brought
if it's first degree rape second degree rape or whatever they only get to decide on that this person has been charged with first degree rape and you can decide guilt or innocence on that
such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees the other thing that juries are restricted on that you usually don't get to hear all the information
it's what information is presented and I don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries hear only a fraction of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence and to me how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it had because they've got it there
so the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information
and the truth that's brought out is as I say when I've heard about don't they?
the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want they don't want the whole truth you can say they only put part of it
the because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the truth that's just like that old witness game it's a game kids play too but somebody did it just for your train of thought where they showed something and they asked there were four people
I don't know what the the last thing I've done as far as car repairs go is change oil and filter and that kind of stuff I haven't gotten really involved in anything extensive in car repairs in probably a year or so I think the last thing I did of any significance was change the water pump on an oldsmobile
I had a similar thing that I've worked on cars ever since I was a kid and that was some time ago but I've gotten to the point where the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that most of the cars I try to buy as simple a car as possible I know what you mean
so changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or fuel injected or fuel injected and so there's
so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that
there's no way somebody once said I had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and I said that means that I can't work on it
basically that's it they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that average guys can't really go out in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs
I've got an eighty four chevy van that's a one ton van with a camper conversion on it
it's got the good old three fifty standard engine in it
regular gas engine and that engine I understand I can actually work on that engine I used to have uh chevy van it was a short van that had the three fifty in it
and basically it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it
and you could get to it to work on it
I had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it the hardest part about water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
that's true you're right by the time you've finally got down to it I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went that's kind of the way I was I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together
a few years ago I had an oldsmobile diesel and the it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and I bought it when we were living in lubbock when I came back here I brought the car back here and I don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff
and the injector pump went bad so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it and reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel
diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers that's true
and I think the closest thing I've come to a diesel is I've worked for a tractor repair shop when I was in high school and we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
and they were nearly all diesel but as far as cars I've never never been involved with them
the injector nozzle and stuff in the big diesel farm tractors what are about the size of your thumb and and you can get to them
you can get to them and the ones in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with I
I've had a lot of good service out of that car but I finally gave it to my son and he drove it literally into the ground
he was out at tech and he finished it off I guess you're right the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status I don't know exactly why one of the reasons is I'm beginning to wonder where do you get gas at I I don't know if it's still limited like it was I don't notice it probably because I
what the availability?
you mean the diesel availability? I don't notice but maybe because I'm not looking for it
I'd bought a g m c diesel pickup and loved that thing I really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasn't what I really needed
and it was the van that I needed then to buy the traded it in on the chevy van but sure enjoyed it but you got the three fifty in the van?
the three fifty regular gas engine that's what I like because they've got plenty of power and if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers I think that they've got the reputation to be
I'm convinced that detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes
I'm convinced that the small v eight like the mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the chevy two eighty threes were good little v eight engines that were not gas guzzlers
but they had enough power pull all this weight
and the four cylinders just don't have it
I think the little chevy v eight when it started out in fifty five was two sixty five something like that
not whole lot more than the six cylinder that I think was about two thirty five or so but they kept boring that block out to where you could get a small block four hundred that was the same block just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more an I think those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but
that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up
the two little cars I've got now bought a mitsubishi mirage here a couple of years ago and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and changing the plugs and stuff that's kind of like
my first car was a fifty six mustang and over the years all I had a dodge pickup several years ago and I can't remember the size of the engine it was a three oh seven or something like that
but I remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things
now you open the hood and it's scary
like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes
the friend of ours over here he's got sixty five or sixty six mustang the six cylinder
and I was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road
it's amazing if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
you could stand in there if you really wanted to I guess my dad's got a new I guess it's an eighty nine or ninety chrysler something or other it's one of those transverse mounted v sixes front wheel drive
and he was showing it to me and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean and you can see the three spark plugs there in the front and I said where are the other three and he'd never really thought about it
and he says hopefully I won't have to change them before I trade it off it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them
when they started with the newer engines when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much trouble because the three fifty with all the actually within a couple of years ago anyway was the last I've paid any attention to it the three oh five was that v eight that they put in the three quarter and half ton van
and it had all the air pump and all that stuff the anti smog pumps
and all the anti smog stuff and that was really a mess back under there in that van and all that stuff loads the motor down
so it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things but that's one good thing I've got a eight ninety chevy blazer now and it's got one belt on it a serpentine belt
it's that one that's about an inch and a half wide
got a bunch of groves in it I haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be better than having I've got an olds toronado that I think's got six belts on the sucker
and I had to get all those off when I was replace that water pump
and I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck when one of them breaks it's not the outside one
it's usually that power steering or something that's way back in there you bet everything else's got to come off first
everything's got to come off it's a pleasure meeting you
and we'll how many times have you done this? is this I've got five stickers here from t I so I guess I've done probably seven or eight of them
I hadn't gotten any calls here in the last this is the first one in a week or so I haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so I don't know if it's tapering off or what
if it's winding down or what I had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting answers
finding a taker so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so people are either not maybe they're burnt out or
let you go thanks for talking I'm back on
you say you watch evenings mostly?
I watch evenings because I work all day I used to watch daytimes
mainly all my children that kind of thing so and then sometimes oprah and sometimes donahue but now it's mainly evenings do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there? which ones?
I tape thirty something and l a law
those are the two I like the best two they're going to change one they're taking off
I know it's going to be history I know I don't know what's going to we like l a law
we don't watch thirty something but that's kind of young for us my husband and I are grandparents
so we don't watch that type of show but we like l a law we like that
we're just I'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there I know I'm amazed I'm not sure I like the new ones too much
I was surprised at the ending with all the funny things happening and different things I just wonder if they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show I know of course I guess that's not bad alan alda did it on mash
I know isn't that funny? it hasn't hurt him at all do you mostly like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?
I don't usually like stuff that continues that's why I'm surprised I like those two shows because usually I like stuff that just ends sort of that you don't have to have watched in one hour like quantum leap
you don't have to that's one of our favorites
you don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow so I usually don't like that which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention
that's always a bummer too I know sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one
we do that sometimes I guess I'm not into real heavy stuff l a law is about the heaviest thing I watch mostly I'm into it for relaxation
so I like things like golden girls or cheers or monday night is real good with me major dad and northern exposure and what's that one with burt reynolds? that type of show is what we watch
we generally just stay on one channel for all of monday night just to watch those just some of the times they're continued but mostly they're just little vignettes a new one we found we really like is that dinosaurs have you seen that?
it's really funny they use animated it's not a cartoon but it's dummies and things that are used
and it's really and robots probably but there's always a moral to each story
and what night is it on? we watched it the times we've seen it it's been on friday night but it's we've only seen it a couple of times but it's real the first one we saw it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy five and I can't remember what day they call it but the son in laws get to throw the mother in laws when they're seventy five over a cliff anyway it goes on
and the son in law and mother in law are sniping at each other and all and then when it comes time for him to throw her over the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
and she said no you can't do he was running in a wheelchair to hide her and she said you can't do that
this is tradition this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the cliff and he said I don't understand it's real funny that they give the teenagers as the one that questions what's going on
and in the end the son in law when he did get the mother in law up to the cliff the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says you can't do it' and then we've got to do it it's tradition' and the son was why? and so in the end he doesn't throw her over
he doesn't and of course the town thinks he's just terrible because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it and then we saw one when a teenage boy comes into his manhood they call it the night of the howling or something like that
and they all go out and howl
and the son refused to do it he did he thought it was not
so he didn't go howl? he wouldn't go howl so all the people that worked with the father ostracized him
how funny it is it's real interesting to watch the show and the relationship between the family is really now the mother in law lives in the house with them
so it's our oldest grandson is the one that got us to watching it but it moves real fast
it's real short and there's always like I say a moral to it and
it's just a half hour or is it hour? half hour
that's all there is to it and they
there's not many half hour shows it seems like that they're trying to liken the father in there of the teenage son to jackie gleason show the way he talks to his mother in law and so forth
and I guess maybe there are some parts of that but I didn't really see that in there but what I've read about it they talk about that but anyway we've enjoyed that and I guess mostly I like the news shows too the news magazines like sixty minutes or twenty twenty or prime time live or something like that all of those shows if I can do it
I watch those if I but my husband likes to watch old movies especially war movies or sports which I'm not
I like sports I don't I do I like ice skating and I like gymnastics and some track and field
but I and I'll watch snippets of baseball games and I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing
and no matter what's on I don't ever just sit and watch t v I'm usually either doing dishes or I may be sewing or I always have letter writing
I know or I may be working around in the room somehow but I don't ever just sit and that's something that comes from your old age
I don't sit idle hands are the devil's workshop
I know who has time? I don't have time to sit I know it's
that's why I don't get to watch that much I watch nine o'clock
I do okay because the kids are all in bed but before that there's not much time
or at six thirty I'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that our if our grandchildren are with us they have to watch that we don't watch it unless they're here
I like that I'll watch game show kind of stuff but they
but it's and the kids will get you started on stuff like america's funniest home videos we've wound up sending in one that's something I didn't think that we'd ever do
did you send one? my oldest grandson pulling his tooth he wouldn't let us pull it
how funny and it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread and I'd tell him it's getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it
and he wound up pull
I don't know I'm not a real great football follower I guess there are two basic teams that I seem to follow every year one is the dallas cowboys and the other is the oklahoma sooners
being a native okie I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing
I see so you make it to that longhorns sooners game?
every year it's funny I got out and got my bachelor's degree in seventy three and never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since how about that but I always enjoyed watching them I just growing up in oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like dallas is around here
and there's always been an interest there
it's kind of same for me I grew up in southern new jersey and the local team was philadelphia
and they were thirty miles right up the river and I'm still pretty much an eagle fan I guess I guess you keep those things you grew up with I worked in missouri for a while and I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals and I was rooting for the cowboys
but they were kind of closer to home when I struck up with them I really don't know what's going to take place with the cowboys this year everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year in a way that happened this past season and I think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe these guys are right maybe they will come through and do something this year I look for it to be a pretty good year
they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago they did they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't familiar with some of them turned out to be pretty good players some of them didn't and maybe the stuff that jerry jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off at least we hope it will
I keep waiting for the eagles to get over the hump they make it to the playoffs for the last few years but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there and they've got a lot of the tools to do it but if they can't just put it together they have got the quarterback there in randal cunningham who's just phenomenal but he's too streaky it seems but they have always been a really strong team
and without a whole lot of big name players they have got a few anchors on offense and defense and they've managed with those guys and I don't know once the pressure gets turned on they seem to loose it
I guess that's the typical trait of the dallas cowboys and the oklahoma sooners
it's funny over the years
I guess since staubach left they haven't been able to keep it going it's been a rough road to hoe ever since he left
I don't know why it's so hard to find a good quarterback these days
that says a lot for his ability though I think for staubach's
he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way aikman has done some of that but the guy winds up getting hurt every other game
I tell you it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things they did they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside it's funny watching them play he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best
and I haven't quite figured that out if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing they say we got to do something now and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes
so I don't know I'm looking for a good year I guess we're always looking for a good year
obviously though do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the super bowl this year or who do you like to do that this year? I don't think the cowboys have got a chance I think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year and they'll get close to it they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end
so who's going to beat them? who are they going to blow it to? that's a good question I'm figuring either the eagles or possibly san francisco I'm not real sure
they'd some big changes speaking of them they did so I don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
I'm sure my sentimental favorite would have to be philadelphia but I sure am scared of them giants that's true those guys are tough they are tough and they're big they're mean and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something
that sure was a fun super bowl to watch this year
I wasn't pulling for either team
but that was just a good football game and it's funny you like to pull for the underdog and for a long time I was pulling for denver
marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does but he's a good quarterback he's got a good arm sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard
l a you mean? I mean l a
speaking of denver on another subject I've been up there five times in the last three four weeks
we've been trying get this new d n b two thousand printer up and running has it been snowing up there?
I was just up there I just got back last night around eleven thirty or so and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground
and it snowed all day that will make the skiers happy
if it snowed that much in denver they got that much up in the mountains just west of there you bet up around the keystone and copper mountain those guys will love that good to talk to you
enjoyed it bob you guys have a good time keep those printers coming we'll do it
do you have annual family reunions or our the my mother's side of the family was quite large at one time and they for as long as I can remember have had a yearly reunion back early on they used to rotate them to different people's houses in the family and
all local were they all in dallas? this was I am actually from mississippi so that's
it was around there generally
that's where the family grew
just from city to city then and it was not only in mississippi in some other places as well
so it was a big deal but they tried to centralize it in one spot so in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year
we rent a pavilion and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good and they will rent a pavilion on a weekend and
do you go back? I have not gone back lately in fact this past sunday was the reunion but I did not get to go I have is it choice or just business or not getting to go
just the distance involved and
just not I have a younger daughter now and I it's kind of hard to get her there and everything
but I am going to hopefully next year get to go back cause a lot of the family on my mother's side has not seen my daughter so
do you have brothers and sisters? I have one brother so
and is your mother still living?
so you go back and visit with her anyway would you not?
either way there was family reunion time or not I usually see her a couple times a year
so that's no big thing but I do enjoy the reunions the only problem is that now originally when we had them they were mainly my mother's
relatives father's my mother's father's family had quite a few brothers and sisters
so it was a large reunion of that group from that descendants
and a lot of those people have and at time they all knew one another
and now it has gotten that a lot of those people have died off or what we are left with is the relatives of that group
the next generation and so it's not quite as close as it used to be so I think people feel less of a desire to really go I know that
why do you think that it's less close than it used to be? I just think that at that when they were those were all brothers and sisters a lot or they were all in the same geographical location
back around in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up they were all located together in one small community
and when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth and now when they come together it's generally the kids of those people who are not anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that used to be there which is a shame
but that's just how it is my mother was complaining last year about it's dwindling down every year I think that's just
is that just family's lack of priority anymore maybe
we get so involved in our work lives and just social lives and so forth
that's I think that's some of it but I have I it's just the way I think society is now is that we do not have the extensive family we used to
it's more of a smaller unit and we tend to try to do things with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know very well
it really makes an effort to do this anymore
it requires a lot of effort to do that sort of thing
I used to enjoy going I still do kind of enjoy it but it's not as many people there that I really really enjoy seeing
I it's going just for the sake of getting together I think for the family and
do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group? on a regular basis not just christmas cards
not really in that but then again I have some aunts that I do that's about my mother's sisters
but I feel closer to them because I kind of grew up with them but as for the rest of that group not really
and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion so
you do not really feel that really close to them
in my father's family we get together every year at a different location either dallas or oklahoma city they had chosen santa barbara california for this summer and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or in the texas oklahoma area
so they cancelled that one and are looking next year bringing it back closer but we have a letter a family letter that circulates
and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put your new letter on the top and then that's the way it's kept in order about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion you do not feel like I do not know anything about this person you have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth that's a good idea
so you are kind of half way acquainted that way
and that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other I think
we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and I said let's start this letter and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got I sent it on to the next one
but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in scottsdale arizona for that family
we are real glad we got together because since that time there were only one sister and one sister in law of the original family left and the sister in law died and the sister is in a nursing home so we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
I haven't heard anything about the proposal myself but I don't know if it's their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around
I haven't either I've always felt for a long time that I think that all young kids ought to do a stint primarily in the military
most countries require that now they have it mandatory for at least the young men
I don't know about the young women I don't know if they have to serve in the military too a lot you take israel everybody does
I don't think it's a bad idea teaches a lot I went in the service when I was eighteen and stayed in for ten years
is that right? did a lot of growing up I bet you have to
my father had been in the military I didn't do it myself my father had and that's how he put himself through school basically
he came from a poor immigrant family and he didn't have a chance to the family wasn't wealthy so he had to do something to put himself through school do it himself
and he did and he was very successful my parents wanted to send me to college and I was dead set against it I had wanderlust
and I got in and after wasting the first six years partying and everything else I decided time to settle down and do something so I started to work on my education
course my job was such that I couldn't do it as much as I wanted
and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree that's pretty good but I've been in school ever since that's good I guess
that's I don't know there's other kinds of service to the country that could be done if you don't like
working in the national parks working clean up the roadsides
I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time not all the time but at least some of their time to look for to go out and clean up the roads
all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients and if they're able bodied people I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards paint the houses
we'd learn service to other people in this country so I'm get something out of that money
country would benefit I've
my next door neighbor when I was growing up worked for the unemployment division and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able bodied and
that right and he had all kinds of horror stories these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks and back in those days they also use to give you booklets good for clothing and gas and things like this
they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games
and I have a hard time dealing with that
what I hear one time I think it was on paul harvey's radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive forty five thousand dollars
I was astounded I don't even make that I know you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
and somebody's taking that away and there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
no doubt it's totally ridiculous and when I first got in graduate school I was going into public administration and quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more
is that right this is the kind of thing you look at
you sit there and when you're writing up budgets you wonder how much money do we need you need x number dollars for the recipients but you need x number dollars to administer the program just ridiculous this is ridiculous
it's sad it is it's pathetic there's got to be a different way there's got to be a better way but it'll never happen these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks
what would happen if the required young people to do service to the country what should they get in return I wonder like I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance give an incentive
educational or vocational training or something something that's going to help them along the way
and they'll help the country eventually too because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people
this look at the statistics
and that's only going to help it's sad one in five americans can't read
adults that is can't even read and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math
what are we becoming? we're becoming a service country
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago we were an industrial giant and now we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game we taught them how to do it and they did it better than we do simple as that
because they have the ambition I guess simple as that
which is good for them but on the other hand we kind of lose out it's terrible for us
I think that if young people had service to the country might give them more ambition because they learn that serving other people is a good thing
and it can be good for them too
even the greedy kids that we've got now
you go to the mall and you see fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night I know for what I know
give me the money and I'll teach them something good you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
that's my other complaint parents aren't parents any more
they've relinquished their parenting one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble?
as a substitute teacher for a year I can say
I talked with somebody else about that another time and when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math I was teaching as part of the program and I just love teaching that's probably the most fun I had and it helped me out because I learned things and learned how to do things differently
and when come time to get out of school I thought I'd like to teach but for what
I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
that's a sad thing to think and that's kind of selfish on my part and I admit that in a way it is but you have to look out for yourself
that's right that's and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers that's wrong
I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less I saying teachers should be paid more they do an absolutely necessary job I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
but there's a sense of priorities here too
we need what's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids
they both have their place they
but when it gets right down to it one's on the other hand you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twenty six thousand dollars
that's pretty good I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
my other pet peeve is unions
it's ridiculous the way unions have gone there was a time when unions were needed
and they served a good function and they served a good function but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated and they're only there to perpetuate their own power structure
I remember the company my dad worked for the people there went on strike against the management it was a steel manufacturing place and they this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap and they were having a hard time and they told the strikers there we need you to come back and get this stuff done or else we're going to be out of business and they wouldn't come back so they went bankrupt
and they all lost their jobs and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country and it's
so many times you had the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time and that took care of that industry
that's right and I'll tell you detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country
and they're trying to do that now with the imports we've never caught up and I don't think we ever will
it'll be a tough road though here it is and we've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars
and they only did it because they were embarrassed that they're so good at it
that's about right back to the original subject I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service I don't care what kind it is
it teaches them pride in their country and pride in themselves too
that's right you could organize something just within your community same old thing
that's right that's like eagle scouts
and that's a great idea I think they ought to take them and just have sort of like a manpower pool and say we need somebody
if you're from iowa you must be very artsy crafty everyone I've ever known from the midwest can do everything with their hands actually I'm from california and before then I was from utah so
I didn't know anyone ever moved from california to iowa? I grew up in california and then I went to school in utah and I got married there and we stayed there for a while and then now we're in iowa
I'm teasing only because I'm from indiana I like the midwest but I married a texan and they have a way of dragging you back home
anyway we're supposed to be talking about crafts do you have any hobbies that you do things with your hands like knitting or
I crochet and I do water color and I sew and I do fabric painting
you do a lot then do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching? I've done some cross stitching I haven't tried any needlepoint yet how about you?
actually I'm pretty untalented
I used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting but I don't know somehow I don't have the time anymore but I have all these friends that wherever you go they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their bags their most recent needle craft
and in december everyone was doing stockings these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings
those take a lot of time
I only can do things that are pretty fast because we just got our baby last year and I just don't have the patience to just do something
is this your first baby?
have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets? I crocheted an afghan for our bed that's the only thing and I did a quilt let's see I've done a quilt for our baby and I've done a quilt for our bed but
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself or how did you make a quilt?
our baby's quilt it was like the design I just went around the design in the quilt
I didn't piece it or anything like that but
but you actually hand quilted it yourself? and
did you need a loom or were you was it small enough that you could just hold it? I put it on the quilting frame are you familiar with that?
but again my mother back in indiana we had a quilting frame in our basement and she would quilt whole quilts by herself
which I was always amazed I have one of them but to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work I haven't done tons of them but I used to do more before we got our baby but
you think children you can use crafts to make wonderful things for children
I think when babies I think afghans and the crocheted little sweaters are wonderful and they'll wear them
once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them one thing that I like about this fabric painting thing is I can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then cut out a little pattern from some material like flowers or something and make a design or a little arrangement or something on the shirt and fuse it on with heat and bond or whatever and then paint around it and I usually sew around the flower whatever first and then I paint around it so you can't see the stitching as much does that make sense to you? so
I think it's very clever it's funny that you said for christmas my daughter and I received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for us a beautiful christmas design
and they were matching and they were lovely but when I washed them although I took the precaution of turning them inside out and truly everything fell off or most of it
so I went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back and I bought the paint and redid most of the edges
and it was salvageable and I but it's so I'm familiar with that but I think you're very clever to sew around the edges I think gluing alone certainly if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges
someone told me that they had done it both ways and after hearing that I always sewed it on a loose zigzag even helps and
as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend I took on a painting project in my bathroom and I had wallpaper up I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because the wallpaper getting it off I had to wet the walls down and that had to dry and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day you didn't try rewallpapering? you just
I just painted did you use a textured paint or
the wall behind the paper was smooth so I just used a semigloss
and did you get good results?
not really I need to it looks so bad you can see where those spackling marks were
I need to either paper back over it or do something but it didn't cover it?
it covered the spots pretty good but it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to we did a we moved last august and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to one of the paint stores and they just said you can get by and I forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark
more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the dark it was just a real dark wood grain type paneling
and it was smooth and we put this stuff on and it supposedly textured it or did something to it but because of the dark behind it it was really hard to cover and
was it like a primer? it was something like that although when we got through I wished we hadn't done it because we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to make it and it really was the advice they give you is the job was considerably tougher than we thought
particularly when you try to I was talking to somebody else who had a lot of wood panelling and they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like it was a good sized den with a lot panelling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something
that's an awful lot have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted?
not inside when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it that was one of the requirements from f h a that the house be painted before we bought it
and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim around the house was
if I remember right it was like five hundred dollars that's quite reasonable
so that wasn't too bad problem have you tried matching paint lately?
I haven't my wife we built a shed over the long way actually it took this is not on the topic but I did finish it but my wife went to the home depot and took a piece of brick
and she wanted to paint the shed it's a wooden shed and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint
and they got and in fact she put some right she got they mixed a gallon of it and it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint and it does it electronically something magic
so they did do a good job?
they but it's electronic
you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and determines the and it's really remarkable the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the trim
but didn't occur to them that they could have taken a sample from
I forgotten this is sherwin williams paint or something but it's remarkable that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right
but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match?
as a matter of fact what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a blue and the blue even two years later or so it doesn't match
it's the very same type of paint and everything
so you so what's your what's the solution then?
I have no idea I repainted the whole thing
at least you'll get very good at it?
you could go back and paint the whole thing over
this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it seems like everybody has to go in and do I'll just do a little bit here and a little there
although the it we almost one day we painted the house to we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought we did the one wall but the other trim I think we left most of it because it gets to be they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't
the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white
white that's what we're trying to get ours to look like good luck we wound up selling the house
I don't know whether it made it does it's interesting that the white makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room it has molding like picture frames that are along the walls up a couple of feet
and my wife painted the insides of those dark blue
I see and it makes the room look remarkably smaller
she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color? the trim is still white the molding white
but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive
but it makes the room look smaller which is
it explains why they have everything white but you wouldn't think that I
maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff but
what about the lighting? did it make a big difference? not particularly because the house has so many windows
it has the living room has four good size windows and of course at night but with the we have a soccer field that's about a hundred yards from our house
and the lights shine right at our house it's kind of we didn't know that when we bought the house but
so that you get some the color doesn't really matter because you have that light we have a lot of light and I think it's just the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so it didn't change
I see but the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which is probably the topic we're really on to that the masking is
you have to do that very very carefully
and it takes a long time that's right you can work yourself to death I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend
no kidding it's kind of frustrating
it is a lot of work a lot of work I've got to go to a meeting it's been good talking to you nice talking to you
my last auto repair was my alternator went out I have a nineteen eighty six toyota it's a little tercel
and I have a friend who's real good with repairing cars so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and get a replacement part
so we went to a place called quality auto parts and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and everything and they're very reasonable so I bought the alternator we put it on the car and it didn't work and it blew out all the fuses
how much was the alternator? something like sixty nine dollars something on that order
did he hook up the wiring wrong? he hooked it up right it was just that the part just didn't fit the car so I took it back and the guy in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them and he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we went back and tried it again put it on again and it still didn't work and we took the car up to a little place called pep boys I don't know if you have them in your area
but they're pretty reasonable car repair place also so towed it up there because it wouldn't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and took them about an hour to figure out what was blowing the fuse and it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway ended up taking it to the toyota dealer and the only problem was that it had to be a genuine toyota alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it they sit in there and everything but there's just some little difference that causes it not to work an
they probably built that in so they could make money I guess so and that was my last experience
I had a weird there's a little sensing device right in front of the fan it's an air conditioner sensing device I don't know why it actually there's a metal piece that fits through the belts and somehow that broke off and I still can't figure out how it broke and anyway so this piece obviously I have a subaru and I think you can only get it through subaru dealer etcetera so
this little sensing device costed sixty bucks are you able
and I haven't had too many problems with my car I got a eighty eight subaru g l x t and it
and then just basic maintenance and oil changes and I do not do my oil changes and I will not do my oil changes I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up trying to borrowed somebody else's jack and I did this and I went and bought everything
so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least or somewhere in there and then to go to the trouble that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at jiffy lube
so that's as far as any maintenance on my car I shy away from the oil changes that's for sure my car it's an eighty six and I really hadn't had any trouble with it until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it and this was just recent so I really can't complain about this one
how did you put that many miles on it in four or five years? I used to work
it was a seventy mile trip everyday two ways was seventy miles
a hundred and forty mile trip? it was just seventy miles
thirty five miles each way
and I did that for about three years and it really added up I've only taken maybe two trips that were about four hours long down to shreveport and the rest of it it's just basically driving a long ways to work and now I drive twenty three miles each way so I'm getting little relief but still I drive a long ways
but I guess because they're highway miles it's not so bad on your car as if it were just regular street
do you work for t I? I do do you?
I was going to ask you as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now I don't work for t I and I get these green I don't know what you want to call them fake point things points
and I just wondering how I go about getting the cash there's a number that you call it's the same number that you call to make a call
you call that number and somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message
I know someone that did that you leave a message and they'll call you back
that's good to know I haven't been doing this is the first time I've been called in a long time and I haven't been doing it so
and I've done it maybe twelve times
I don't know if I've done it quite that much but mine is mixed up too I have to call and get it fixed let's see before I had this car I bought an audi five thousand
but I bought it used I just bought it from a friend who just charged me what the dealer was going to give him for it for a trade in and it had a whole lot of miles on it I figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it an I did get a couple of good years out of it and the engine messed up on me and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the audi dealer and he took the engine apart and he just said he couldn't fix it so the engine never got put back together again I
I was driving a sixty six plymouth fury I think those old cars might be a pretty good bet because you
and that's when they made cars though I don't know
the body was in good condition and it ran fine it was starting to burn some oil
but I had to about couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car so I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four
these cars made in the sixties and stuff the thickness they're just you just don't see cars like that
and they last a long time and they were simple too the engines were simple and durable and some people will still buy them
they'll I guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions and I guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time course I guess I could do the same thing with the toyota that I have I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to
it almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it you're just better off buying another car I guess so but I just think they cost too much in the first place now a days did you hear our topic? it's in regards to discussing homes
homes are you settled in a place? I'm settled in a place I've been in it for actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight and it's in richardson texas which is north dallas
and we've lived in two houses in richardson we moved here in seventy four and changed locations in seventy eight how about yourself?
we left here in seventy six we were here for a few years then we have come back just this summer right now we're looking for housing somewhere down in the duncanville and cedar hill area are you familiar with that? it's a nice area
it is the kids are in school here in duncanville we're in a temporary place right now so they've enjoyed the school so we're kind of trying to stay here but are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or
the problem we got is that we've got five children
and so we really want four or five bedroom house and everybody says how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing
so we look at the paper we talk to our realtor and you can cut the listings in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms or five
are you looking or you settled we're settled and we're
having I'm probably older than you I'm fifty two but anyway my youngest is getting married this year graduating college
so I can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe
that empty nest syndrome is going to set in I guess so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere closer to our families
are you from florida originally? from west virginia but my wife's parents are from the new york new jersey area
but everyone has seem to relocated down that area
seems like a nice place to go
we've got five and the oldest is ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and I think they're going to be with us forever
I don't know if that's true but it's sure we're not anywhere near looking to cut down in size we're trying to find I understand you need very minimum four and probably five
in fact six would be real good
my wife and I can share a bedroom it's tough to find a five and six bedroom house isn't it? either
I don't think it's possible unless you multimillionaire something like that I know
seems like you get in that category you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever and that's an awful lot it is
we're having actually if we find something for less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right
that's but I think the thing's out there it's just a matter of finding the right place just matter of looking
lot of people in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do something I had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and there were seven kids in her family
and they converted the dining room and did this and that
but they always seemed to get along fine
I think once we get into a place it will be just fine but until then it's a little stressful just looking all the time and that sort of thing
I know and there's nothing harder than that I always just sort of assign my wife that chore then I would let her narrow it down to three or four then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do
maybe that's the case at least she's got more opinions seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about openness the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore I understand that
what kind of business are you in?
I'm in the sporting goods business I'm a manufacturer's rep I represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies who are you with?
we're with an organization called wycliff bible translators
it's a missions organization and doing translation linguistics that sort of thing
it's got an office down here near duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so how was the you say you lived in the denver area before?
how did that compare with this area as far as housing prices?
we were really surprised to find that they're higher here no kidding
when we moved from louisiana to denver it was astounding to find that prices were almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not I guess really prices for housing are just
as far as I'm concerned it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching reasonable doubts which had a capital case in it
and I personally have my own feelings about capital punishment is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony
I do too mandatory summary execution on the steps that day
I think I'm in that same I think if it's a convicted felon on parole and he goes out and commits another crime or kills somebody I feel the same way
I think that person is beyond rehabilitation and he should be taken out I also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation
but I do know that almost all people usually die before that point
they just get too old
as far as capital punishment on it's own merits I have the trouble with the way it's applied I think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner and I've said this very often and I believe it to be a very true axiom so I would rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent because if you're black and you kill a white guy you're going to fry they will kill you
and if you're black and you kill a black guy it's two hundred hours of community service
you don't hear too much of those cases it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship
we're the majority so we can do whatever the hell we want to do that's right and you're the minority and you're stuck with it
but we had this in the vietnam war we had population of blacks among military people in vietnam was about eighty percent
but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent
the handwriting's on the wall there isn't it?
it sure is but that's another issue altogether
it's as far as capital punishment I think that ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment I think the guy should have ninety days and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence
the only thing I don't understand I guess I don't understand our judicial system as it is right now because if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution? how is there
that goes back to when america was a colony of england
in england you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty judge said he's guilty kill him there were some people that had a problem with that because they found out later on that a guy will lie rather than get killed
and he'll say that guy did it not me
or he'll have somebody lie for him people lie it's a strange thing
but they do that and to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the constitution a protection against judicial mishap
and the judicial mishap in this event would be you got the wrong guy look at that guy at e systems
they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of an establishment that had a very high level of security sense too and these were really responsible people
and they convicted this guy because somebody says he looks like the right guy
they all look the same to me
big lips flat nose that was him
what do you think about convicted go ahead
what kind of car would I want to buy
I don't know the question is would I want to buy or would I probably actually buy may be two different things if you had all the money in the world or something if I had all the money I wanted then that's whole different matter
in that case I don't know my dream car for years was a porsche turbo
but I don't know if I'd want one of those now
of course I would want one if somebody was given to me
but I maybe would buy a b m w or even a volvo what do you have now?
I've got a dodge daytona
it's actually the first car we ever bought new I have my car is the first one we ever bought new too
but we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually me too
what car do you drive? what is it? mine is a honda accord
we almost bought one of those do you like it? I do and it's funny because after I bought it I was doing a lot of business traveling and I some of the cars that I got were the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors
and I don't like them as well except it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics and mine is a standard
and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better
it had a lot more pickup and everything
you get a little more control over when it's doing the things it's doing
what rental agent did you go to to rent those kind of cars usually avis to what avis? avis
I guess it's just because we're on I think of it I'm not sure those are avis or not but we have corporate contracts with the various companies I see
so it depends on your destination too kind of strange
you work for a big company then work for t I which is how I heard about this t I I see
but I don't know if I were to buy a car with the constraints of real money I probably would go with something like a honda accord
maybe it would one thing I really liked about the dodge daytona is the fact that they have this seven year warranty
and it really saved us some big money once it did
they had a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time
and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars and I had to pay twenty five for the that was great
it was that's unusual to hear usually something breaks you look at the warranty and it's excluded
we bought the extension and at the time we bought it it was four hundred and twenty five dollars or something extra I see
you got your money's worth
we did but we really debated at the beginning and of course I'm glad I did it that is good
but we still have three years left on it I've been lucky mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
but I was real lucky because it just hit the lens to the light bumper?
it didn't actually dent the car or anything so it cost me twenty five bucks to replace that
that was good and the store will pay for it anyway are you so no big deal
if you were going to buy a new car would you buy another accord? I probably wouldn't just because I already have one
but if I had to make the choice again I'm perfectly happy with what I decided although we did just buy another car and that's a legend
those are nice but it's a used one
and my husband has really wanted one for a long time and the fact that this car that I have has performed so well and before that I also had an accord it was a real old one
and I bought that used I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that and it served me real well too
so he's been impressed with all the honda cars and
my sister drives one she drives a is it legend
it's a I'm not certain but she's liked it
but I have never had and we in fact what I'm driving right now we only had one car for a long time and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth four miles to work and back kind of thing
and so I bought a used yugo just to be a little car that I could care less about how did it go for you?
it's worked hasn't left you stranded
that's exactly what it is it's a cheap little car just to go run around town in I know
and it's actually kind of fun to drive I getting back in the daytona now I almost don't like it
it's too mushy and it's an automatic
and that's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the legend it's too the steering it's windy
you feel like you're in a boat or something it's kind of I can't drive that the legend it's just so huge
I don't like it and it's so
are you on a regular exercise program right now? and I hate it
how about you? I'm kind of off and on
off and on I guess I've been kind of off and on I've had some health problems that have led me to right now I'm kind of off
I'd say more on than off what type of exercise do you do?
I do walking on the treadmill and then I do low impact aerobics I guess you don't enjoy that very much
not really do you find that to be boring?
and time consuming it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming it's afterwards then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up
I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring but I
is this something that you go through every year I haven't decided whether I want to play yet or not I just bought myself a solo flex machine I don't know if you've seen those advertised on t v
it's one of those universal type exercise machines but I haven't really sat down and used it match yet so it's collecting dust right now
a lot of things do that I had an exercise bike I used to jog somewhat
I use to have one and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it but I do use my treadmill that's good my parents have a treadmill it's when I go visit them I get on that thing every now and then
it's nice because when the weather's bad you don't have any excuse I just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something
I can't ride a bike so I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold so thought I better get outside and do something and not waist the day
it's too nice it's been too nice all weekend but I need to start something again I've always of that to be really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently
have you ever had any injuries from jogging? I never have I don't job enough to develop any injuries I usually only go about a mile or two
I guess it worries me about jogging that I hear that it's very hard on your body and that you can end up getting hurt worse
it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt
suppose to be much better if you find grass or dirt to jog on
that's not quite so easy you have to have the right type of shoes too that's very important
I found that true especially from walking on toe and fronts but
I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often my don't get very much use
I guess my breakdown about every six months I usually enjoy the exercise I do but like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a program so I'll bicycle I get into that for a little while and maybe go out on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile but then I'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week
but that gets old too in a very short order
I'm hoping that this solo flex will change things a little bit I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
don't let it collect dust at least exercise while dusting it off
maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can start some type of regular program
that'll be good I've always found that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep something going
when I was in high school we had a choice of taking physical education courses on exercise an one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and working out like that
and that was very helpful we kept charts of our progress and consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
I found that to be very helpful
are you going to do that? I need to
I haven't started yet but it's a thought
that sounds like something good to do then sounds like something I should do
nice way to start off this spring
get back in shape how often do you go out each week on your walking?
I do I switch every other day one day I walk and one day I do the aerobics about how far do you go walking?
I'm trying to get my tolerance now I just had surgery less then two months ago and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half
but I'm trying to workup to three miles that's good they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging it
it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect
but if you keep up with a consistent pace just to keep the heart rating going my walkman broke so I'm upset
and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud but it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is
it is and this doesn't my treadmill has an incline and you can get a really good workout on it do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on t v? I just do it on t v
I have a cassette which shows do you watch on t v?
it's a I use tapes like a cathy smith workout
or richard simmons or jane fonda
sweating to the oldies every now and then I'll watch e s p n I get cable on t v
and they have a couple of shows called basic training and what is the other one called
there was one guy I use to watch on e s p n I don't know if he's still on any more or not I don't know if I get e s p n or not
but one I use to watch one on the air but that was back bodies in motion that's the name of the one I was thinking of
that's was with gill
I watched that cause he was cute he's not bad his assistants usually aren't either
but they're always in hawaii some place on the beach
but then that was back when the high impact and they do low I pact stuff now do they they're on every day
are he's still doing it then every morning
I'll have to tune in it's on e s p n at what time I can't remember what time it's I can't remember offhand what time
I'll have to check it back up
but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show at least on every now and then
not everybody has a picture perfect body I found that they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on t v I haven't watch any other ones on t v just on some of the tapes they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day monday through friday incase you're interested in that
I actually taped a few session that they had on there but I haven't done so much as watch the tape that I made that's a thought so I'm kind of bad about that myself
that's thought I haven't thought about that they're going to beep us pretty soon I sure enjoyed to you about exercise and fitness nice talking to you too talk to you later
advice on son or daughter going to college
that's advice that I will need in time future for my children rather than one that I have personal experience with
I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs
let's see when I went away to school I'm trying to think my criteria I guess when you're eighteen or so it would be important to know if it was a coed college
that was a strict requirement for me again how serious a person is according to what they want to get out of school I guess they'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home let's see what was the question what's the criteria for picking a college? what advice would you give? what advice
I guess one clear cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus
stay in a dormitory if you can go to classes talk to faculty members and students
and also depending on how adjustable your child would be or flexible if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe they were unused to the way they run things the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges I think the people are different and you have to be more flexible and more willing to adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to I'm thinking what problems my children might have in that you think so? but I agree with you
let's see what else climate would be you'd have to
is somewhat if it's something different than the one they're used to I guess if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time not be in studying if you're in florida or california
I'd also advise them that if mom and dad paid for their college that if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year then they'd have to get a loan to continue
course it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness one to work during the summer or part time and two to take out loans to assume debt after college that's right there's
the responsibility of that and they could work and earn money towards college also if they stay within their state you get a lot more financial aid or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school
and like I said if they was willing to work in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is by the time I have an eleven year old is my oldest so it's not too far away but it's mine is twelve
but it's getting there we still definitely can put away the money for college now I would advise that they did not have a car at college they would that's my gut feeling too I my son is certainly not persuaded of that
I'm here I didn't have a car in college I think it's more a burden to provide for
I think so too I think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of and I think it's just trouble waiting to happen so I would advise they didn't take a car and they didn't take a television is it
and they didn't take a refrigerator maybe that I didn't do any of those though I feel less strongly about the t v s and refrigerators I we didn't have
I don't know what to do about the federal budget there certainly have been ideas surfaced recently matter of fact repeatedly by many people and I sort of wondered what thoughts you had on that area
the first one is we need people in there that understand numbers the numbers that are being thrown around when we're talking in trillions of dollars which is an astronomical sum
and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means are you talking about the elected people or are you talking about others? the elected people
our senate and congress and people that deal everyday and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works
we need to elect people that are more or I'm not sure how you would how would you achieve that? if
let's make them have a degree in economics so you would trust the decision making economists?
sometimes called the dismal science
but people that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar
and in the lobbyists needs them to be eliminated from congress
they don't make pragmatic decisions they make a decision based on constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe
or they tack on this pork bellies and do things that are good for their area to pass something that is not good for the country so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say make them all
I definitely would get rid of them
no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for?
I think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute
but they should not have a one on one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them
that's a conflict of interest as far as I'm concerned
when you are talking again billions and trillions of dollars you're jeopardizing the future of the country for today
that so you talk about jeopardizing the future would you be against any deficit spending?
I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line you can't ease into it it took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now
I forget the figures on the interest rate but it's something like hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest
part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves we buy from intimate international banking that's why we have interest
and I really feel that is part of the problem that we've let things get so out of control that we don't want to put the brakes on them but what practical steps could one take?
by having a budget that is reasonable but everybody will say that he is for that and how will you make that actually happen? of course and then add on to it
you take the gross national income and you say our budget is x number of percent of this gross national income
one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax across the board
everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax sounds like a good idea
nothing escapes? no deductions nothing that's right
no deductions just ten percent
you pay a ten percent income tax
that's what you pay if you make forty million dollars then you're going to pay four million
if you make forty dollars you're going to pay four dollars and that's it so that's it that's I agree with that that's a good idea and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or lower them or what? I don't know that it would or wouldn't do you want to go first? you can go first or I will
you go ahead I'm going to tell you what I'd have
down in the south we have a lot of shrimp?
and I have shrimp that is steamed in beer that I cook
and then I have a cauliflower that I would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert
it sounds fantastic and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your rice cooker
and you place the shrimp in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some red pepper over it
you can either use the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some regular red peppers is it cayenne pepper you mean? cayenne?
and you put a little bit of that over it if you use the dried kind? then you would only use two of them
and you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it and how much shrimp would you use? two pounds
two pounds that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells
leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up
and you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it
and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil and the shrimp turn pink
then you remove it and you put it on a platter and then you serve it with melted butter and I usually put garlic powder in mine
and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it
but then the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave
and what you do is you just wash it and you core it and in a pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave a glass dish
but it's got to have one that has a cover on it
and you put about two tablespoons of water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt
and then you just set your cauliflower in there
and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time
and are you cooking the whole head at one time?
when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off
I see and you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time
and while that's cooking I take about a cup of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and I mix it all together and I shred up some just regular white cheese
and after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that and you cook it for another three minutes on high just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it and it's done
that sounds fantastic it is good
but it looks what I usually do is I'll sit the cauliflower in the middle and then I put the shrimp around the outside of it on my platter
and then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that and you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then I just fix little individual cups for them and they have the garlic bread
and it makes it a real nice looking and it's not much work
but it looks like it that sounds
you look like you went to a whole bunch
I bet it tastes good too and usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it
and I'll lay those on top of my salad to make it look nice and things like that
how many could you serve? it usually serves six
I figured about that
that's good out here we have so many ethnic people we have italians and we have portuguese and we have russians and polish and it depends out here the type of people you're going to entertain?
so it's hard you just have to pick something for the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time
and they're big on finger food here too chicken wings and ribs and that kind of stuff barbecue and cooking out in the yard when it's nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff
have you ever had crawfish?
but I have had shrimp you ought to try some crawfish they are good but that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over even if it's out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking
of course they want it from down here that's
because just now especially crawfish it is starting to move out and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is but
is it like shrimp? it's similar
it's similar it's not exactly
it's got a taste of its own but it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it it does? does it look like a lobster?
it looks more like a crab
it looks more like a crab but
are they thin long or wide?
I can't even think of what you I guess it looks more like a cross between a crab and a lobster
because it's small like that and it's got the pinchers like a crab but it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would
and we call them mud bugs
but they're fantastic tasting they are so good everybody it's the season for them right now
and where did you say you were from? louisiana
louisiana do you do cajun cooking?
I love blackened the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff
we have a few places up here that do that
and if ever I see it on the menu I always get it it is so good you know
how do they do the blackened? you buy it as a seasoning
but do you have to have a certain skillet or something?
I cook mine do you have a black iron skillet?
I did have I don't have it now but I have mostly teflon I guess you could cook it in that too
you now but but I don't know I never have I use the black iron skillet to cook mine
does it have to get extremely hot?
but it doesn't burn or anything like that the blackening is really the seasoning
it's a blackening seasoning I see
that is a seasoning it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it
I see because what it's called is blackening magic and it comes in a bottle and I'm trying to see
it's got a picture of dom de luise on it
you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time?
is that what you're saying?
because I could have the chicken on the skewers with blackened seasoning but
and that is so good delicious but you do have to have it hot when you cook it your pan
it does have to be really hot when you put it in but it's not like it's burned and what blackens it is the seasoning and it is so good it is I love it
in fact I was in texas for a little while
and I liked the barbecues and the mexican food
I have a passion for all that type of different tastes because I have been brought up mostly italian american food because my parents are italian and portuguese so we cook a lot of pasta and gravies and pizzas and roasts and that kind of thing
that's why I enjoy going to restaurants and trying different things have you ever thought about coming to louisiana to visit?
I would love to you ought to come down
I you don't even have to go all the way to new orleans if you want to really get some good food
you don't have to go that far south
but of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as I'm concerned is that right? and fact is we're going to take a vacation this year we're going to go to new orleans again
and we're only going down there for the food though
where do you go when you go there? right on basin street and those places? we go to the french quarters and stuff like that
and I have some friends that live down there and so usually we don't go to the tourist ones
we go to the ones that they tell us to go to
I see and we went to this one it was called the back porch and they were cooking the stuff while we went on this boat ride and then we came back and ate out on this back porch and usually if you can find somebody
that's nice of course when you go down there they've got just there's no where you can miss
I have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full it's unreal
it's so good the seasoning it's just unreal
and don't they make a lot of I'm trying to think what they call their soup I don't know gumbo jumbo gumbo gumbo
is that with seafood? you can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood you can?
that looks good too I've seen the chefs on t v do that?
and it looks delicious and I'll tell you what
we do a thing we call it a sea bake you take clams here goes sharon
what do you think about nolan ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars? that's the only thing I found out tonight
you found that out tonight?
I haven't even heard that that's great I think he deserves every penny of it
but there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than football players would
wonder because football
and they play a lot longer season too and a lot more games?
that's exactly right
but I think let's see the teams that were there last year were somebody from california I don't even know who won the pennant last year beats me I know yankees have won a lot games through the years not lately though we have been talking about this I tried to call earlier
and we had made a list of all these baseball teams and the cities that they were from then I started cleaning and I don't even know where I even put that paper
threw it away I was just cleaning and throwing
let's see the teams that I think the a's were in it last year the oakland a's and have you ever played baseball?
I played softball that's what I did when I was growing up that was fun
that's fun that's a whole different sport
let's see but I think the rangers need to go and I think the pirates will go and let's see rangers have got a new guy this year I don't even remember his name either do you ever go see the rangers?
every once in a while I like to go on the nights when there's not very many people out there it's a lot more fun when you're not fighting a crowd I think it's fun I like just looking at the billboards
sometimes if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun it's nice at night
that's when I've been it is
and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there?
that huge it's suppose to be a huge stadium and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and a lake or something running through it and they're going to try to make it a real community center out there and you're going to be able to buy your what was about the liquor?
that's in texas stadium where the football players play so you
and they're never going to let liquor in there they're trying
I know but they try every year and every year they get thrown out it's so stupid because they let you take it in there but they don't allow them to sell it there
but that new stadium's going to be real nice and I heard that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news I heard that they said you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you so
and it's going to go to the highest bidder that's the way to do it
so that could be your fifteen minutes of fame you hear that? that's my kids turning on their music
holly turn it down I think it's the bart man the simpsons
I stay away from them I wish I could
I bet you do where are you?
in plano I'm in garland
you are? my husband teaches in plano
what's he teach? c v a e
what do you do? I teach but I teach for dallas
you do? for right now I'm trying to get out
is that a tough system to be in? real hard?
I would think it it's good because they try new things but it's like they'll try something and then they throw it out and get something else
and you get tired of that that's typical bureaucracy though
I think it's going to be any where you go it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones
I don't know sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad but they can't be though they don't have as much money most of the time
but the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes in dallas you don't even know who's in administration there's so many of them
you don't even know who to payoff? somebody walks in a classroom and you don't know what they're there for when they're coming how long they're going to be
how funny it's just there they are and they're writing the whole time
no communication whatsoever I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything
and I finally just got to where I go I'm debbie moore may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for
because you never know where they are going what they'll report or I know and they'll tell you they've written something down and you hope they're telling you the truth
and you never see it
that's got to be frustrating it is
how long you taught in dallas schools? this is my eleventh year
that's about ten too many actually it's now my job's good much better than a lot because I'm chapter one
and all I do is teach reading all day long
and it's just ten children at a time
that's not bad it's good and you've got a lot of federal money too but hasn't it changed a lot over the years? teaching?
or working in the system when I first started teaching I remember I went to my and I said I want to see a curriculum guide so I'll know what I'm suppose to teach and they go we don't have one we don't even know where one is
and so I go okay you just did what you wanted to do
how funny and now they tell you what to teach and how long and what day what period
you don't know which is worse
I know which is worse
I guess so being told what to do is worse
how long are we suppose to talk for? you can talk for ten minutes but you don't have to
you can? and if you talk to ten then they come on and say you've extended your limit and say good bye within the next five seconds
I haven't ever talked that long I hadn't either till last night I was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland ohio
and we started talking about gangs
he lives in cleveland?
and everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here
but she was real interesting
and then tonight this woman called have you taken any incoming calls?
yours is my second one so hers was the first one I gotten and she was telling me all her problems and it went over ten minutes
did you all not talk about the topic at all? we did but the topic was boring I thought
what would you serve if you were having a dinner party?
all the other the one I talked about the other night was good it was about movies what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that I could go on and on about that
me too because we go all the time the guy I was talking to never goes he was it sounds like you're really up on this I said I see at least two a week
so that was real good to talk about that have you seen silence of the lambs?
you've got to go see that the last one I saw was dances with wolves
we talked about that one too and he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long but I I enjoyed it
I did too it was just more for my money
I didn't think it was too long at all he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch
the other one you need to go see is sleeping with the enemy and how old are your kids? one is eight and one is eleven
you probably don't want to take them to see silence of the lambs it's not too cool for kids they usually pick their own
I bet they do they've got it all figured out
they want to see all the horror movies and ninja turtles
ninja turtles got to have those but most of the time really we watch them on the video
you that's don't you? just massive rental
that's a lot cheaper then taking them out to the show going to I know
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one time that's what we do especially when it's bad weather just plug it in of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything decent I know it's good when you go to tom thumb though and they're cheap and nobody has got them yet that's true unbelievable
that's true we saw heroes have always been cowboys tonight
it was okay it was kind of slow and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end it I don't know one of those movies it's not going to be around long it will be a dollar movie in no time do you read? not very much
I don't have the patience to read I do that to make myself go to sleep at night
my mom and dad read all the time you saw field of dreams a long time ago?
sure did I was reading the book and it's called shoeless joe
it was so wonderful and then I decided I like this author so I got a book of his short stories and that's been real good
who is the author? don't ask me
the ghost of shoeless joe was the name of the book
shoeless joe was it like the movie?
quite a bit but in the movie the guy was black
he wasn't in the book
that's one difference there really wasn't a lot of difference
I didn't I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie that's interesting that was a good movie too do you think we covered baseball?
I think so have a good night
the cowboys are my favorite team that's pretty easy to say nowadays
lot easier than it was a couple years ago but they had a big win today did you get to watch it?
I didn't I have been at my computer all day so are you a cowboy fan?
I used to be a real big cowboy fan and I'm not a jimmy johnson fan
being an okie I just really don't care much
it's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan though
they've always been my favorite
and I guess I still have a soft spot
I just hate that that's the coach that's leading them
so have they they're in the playoffs? they made it to the playoffs finally just two years ago they were one and fifteen they won like just one game and so pretty fast turnaround but this year they made it to playoffs and today was the first game and they beat the chicago bears so everybody's really going crazy down here
I'll bet they are they're going crazy so they turned it around but they have a lot of young exciting players now everybody was real upset when they fired tom landry but now it's like they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that
football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world
hit a bad season and it's the coach's fault let's dump him
first good season the coach can do no wrong
but dallas has always been good ahead heading good players and both running backs and defense
they have a young team it's a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old players every year and same coach same everything so now it's like a taste of something different they're all not mister nice guys like they used to be
now it's tough and dirty team so everybody is really excited and
who is the competition going to be? it's supposed to be the redskins but we beat them already we beat them this year in washington so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl but it's just that we have to play every game away it's going to be tough but the competition are teams that they've already beat this year so atlanta they're in it too and we beat them and detroit we play them next week but we should beat them everybody feels like we should be able to beat them so everything's looking real good
course I think you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal
and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played
the cowboys are on a roll they've won six or seven in a row now so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the league going into the playoffs so
but since you have an o u drop out as a quarterback troy aikman he got hurt at o u so he transferred to u c l a
he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at o u
o u has always been known for their running game more than they're playing tonight in fact
I'm watching them on t v right now but they're doing some stomping on virginia
I tell you they've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts they're doing good tonight are they? I haven't been watching they're winning they're winning forty one to seven good for us
but and that's right aikman did go to o u I forgot about that
they then he went out to southern cal is that where he went? u c l a
but the cowboys did good today I was proud I thought they would get beat today because they're so young playoffs
what would you have at a dinner party?
lately since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties
but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time I have one recipe for a really good type of a meatball it's called burgundy meatball and it's made with red wine and that sounds great
it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then make the sauce when you're ready to serve it
that's one of my favorite things to serve I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party
but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish
I guess being from that part of the country because crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest
but if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like shrimp fettucini is real easy to make and everything
and it's usually well liked by people I guess I'm just a seafood fan so I think on the lines of
how do you cook crawfish?
in fact I just came back from the grocery store and being in texas we don't have too many people that eat crawfish but they had live crawfish on sale
you're not supposed to eat them dead you eat them dead but
don't buy them that way because if they are dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out
and you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you
I'll remember that so if you ever go in a restaurant order crawfish every once in a while you'll see it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then don't eat it
but you just put lots of pepper
and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but they're a pain to peel for some people once you get used to it they're real easy but if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot
when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too? I think for a dinner party I don't know it depends
my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party they would shell their own
we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but if it was more formal like if I was working environment then I would probably shell'em or at least disconnect them from the head but there's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head
still have see that so it would just depend that's the best part of the crawfish
sucking the head but I don't know it just depends on what type it was I guess but you can buy the crawfish shells already peeled'n everything and usually you use those for frying or to put in salads or to make a sauce with or something like that
but you can go ahead and buy'em cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but
does it taste a lot like shrimp it really does I like shrimp better
just the crawfish it just has a taste of its own it also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that
but I think that and also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps
we have a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time and that's what I need
that's what I wish I had but in our family I am the one who cooks and I really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids but I really do enjoy cooking and we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot
and before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and we was really a lot of fun I bet
and that got pretty competitive as far as who could come up with the best recipe it did
we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other that would be fun or
it was a lot of fun it something unique and then we got into different themes whether it would be ethnic food or sometimes it would be maybe an outdoor theme or elegant theme or it was a lot of fun sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something that's right that's fun
it was fun and we threatened to make the other two make us dinner one time just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying
that sounds right I'd take him up on that I'm
it does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just to make sure that they didn't have to do it again I'd be make hot dogs or some potato chips
that's about how much I can cook
I'm doing a lot more cooking now than I used to
but that's only because my mom just started working so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon so I try to have things cooked for her but I usually try to stay out of kitchen
that's nice I don't know not one of my favorite hobbies
it can be fun if you have the time but a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it able to my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she owned every christmas and easter
whenever we have the big get together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce and it has I don't know they are just kind of quarter size meatballs and they are absolutely delicious
I don't know what she calls them in I'm sure she puts wine in it because she cooks everything with alcohol but
I don't know I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
it's in the other room I don't know if we have enough time for it
it's real easy one of the unique things in this it's a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs an egg whatever seasonings you can just light
so salt and pepper and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different that would be wonderful
makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop em up real fine
but it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it and then the sauce is just made with bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and cornstarch instead of flour
so it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in gravy when you have chinese food that kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency how long do you cook the meatballs
the meatballs after you form them fry them in a pan until they're browned on all sides
and then drain off all the grease then what I usually do is I freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it
probably you have to heat it up for a good if they're frozen it may take a half for them to thaw out but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself let them simmer in the sauce itself
and it's real good that sounds great especially the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so far in advance
if you are having a dinner party on wednesday night you could do it on a weekend and then freeze them
that would be great I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I hope to have lots of dinner parties cause I like to
I'm sure that I'll be involved in a big company and I know that my future husband will be he's going to be working for chevron in houston
so he's going to be I'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy you'll meet friends
invite the boss over and friends at work
I have to impress the boss and clients cause I'm in public relations in school
so my whole job's going to be based on my clients'n stuff like that so I'm going to have lots of dinner parties
and have to take'em out to eat right now I'm taking a class on ettiquesy and all the little bitty things that I didn't even know
I thought for sure I'd been raised properly but I've been doing a lot of things wrong I didn't know about
so is there anything else
I think we've covered the subject I got some interesting information about crawfish I was in fact
it's good cause I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale
you need to try em they're wonderful
I will I'm sure my husband will be surprised'cause we were talking about them the other day before
how do you feel about capital punishment?
I'm not certain that it does a lot of good that it ends up effectively avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties you don't think
yet on the other hand I don't know there is things that seems like it's the right thing to do a serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns fifty children in a school yard you kind of I don't know what about yourself? I have the same dilemma I think it seems right sometimes and then other times you don't know
people I it's been the arab societies and stuff end up having effective punishments and they're extremely severe I think to a certain degree the reason that it doesn't serve as a deterrent may be because you never know if it's going to be applied in arab societies if you get caught stealing they chop off your hand and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand
and everybody knows exactly what for
and here with our court system and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can kind of always count on the fact or there is a good chance you're going to get off and also it doesn't seem like it does that many harm their life is taken but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway so I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with
so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for what they've done some people
except that the average cost to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is extremely high something I was amazed at per year it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year to keep people in jail
and it's sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment
but on the other hand I don't know if that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail but then again also you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway so it's
it doesn't it seems that by I don't know doesn't ever really
I know you can't it doesn't taking one more life doesn't get things back the way they were
it doesn't bring back every
I don't know I really don't know what state are you in? I'm in texas in dallas? I'm in austin
where are you calling from? right now I'm in utah but I'm from plano texas
I see what are the laws like in texas?
texas is one of the I guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment texas has had it for a while it's one of the quickest it once it was reallowed I think it was outlawed for a while by the supreme court or the interpretation of the constitution and it seems like everybody stopped and then once they sort of reallowed it texas was one of the first to actually implement it again
they do it by lethal injection
I'm originally from kansas and in kansas also they almost immediately put back capital punishment and there they do it by hanging
still they have I still remember the movie in cold blood I don't know if you've ever I'm sure you're familiar with it but have you seen the movie? I haven't
that way and they do it that way?
they show it not the movie was made in nineteen sixty two or something like that
and so it's not particularly graphic but on the other hand it's fairly impressive to watch them walk into the room with gallows it's kind of a barn like structure I think they're there I think that capital punishment is in utah also I'm not really familiar
is that right? are you there in school? I am
but I think they a long time ago I remember my dad was telling me this that they do it by a bunch of men have guns and one of them has the real gun in it
has a so they don't know who killed
has a real bullets and the rest of them have blanks?
I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner I know that
I've always said that if I had to kill and clean and do my own meat I think I'd become a vegetarian I know
as long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems not so bad I guess now we're ready do you have a personal computer? we have one you do in your home?
ma'am I do not have one in my home I use one all day at work but I don't have one at home do you wish you do you find you use it a lot?
I don't use it as much as my children and my husband do actually my husband and I are taking a class at our local junior college called micro computers one o one and we're just touching on data base spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of different kinds of storage and we're just kind of touching on a basic computer what kind do you have?
we have an I b m compatible it's a gateway brand that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs
that sounds interesting
what kind of a computer do you use at work? I have a p s one I b m type
and I use it all day at work and I put all my personal stuff on it at work
so I really haven't had a need for one at home but probably if I didn't have access to one all the time at work I'd want one at home
I worked on my airline apollo focal point computer for about four years which was different
but I didn't what is that tracking the flights and things? how long are we supposed to talk on this? they tell us when we're through
this is my very first time they come in and tell us have you just started doing this?
they'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that
it's not more than five
but I'm going to ignore that that's a call on my other line so I'm just going to ignore it but
I have that too it's kind of a hassle when you have this but other times it where do you work? I work at texas instruments you do? of course I sure do
of course that's why you're making these calls? I'm doing this at home I'm already home for the day
I see this is a pretty good deal I can't do it at work I work in the legal department so I'm pretty busy
but I use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents we use word perfect lotus
you do know lotus? that's great that's something we want to learn it's really I love lotus
I think that's about my favorite
I've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it that's great it really is and I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to do on it
but you learn something every time you use it
I have a question on this survey or whatever I volunteered for do I start calling in myself or do I wait for people to call me? you can did they give you a number to call?
and eight hundred number you can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you but you can only make one call a day
only one a day if you've talked to someone like you're talking to me now and I place the call this counts as your call
so you can not make a call now until tomorrow
I see so then do you get the five bucks or do I? we both do
we both do that's a didn't they ask you for your I d number when you answered?
I had to put that in so you both do
that's a pretty good deal from what I understand
why are we doing this? it's for research
actually I'm doing this for a friend of mine it's a research type project on voice activated electronics to it's
it's almost like a voice command computer type thing they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up
they're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on this I don't know everything about it
that's wonderful but they try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this and that way they can check voice patterns
I see different kinds of voices and things and get the computer where it recognizes voices
that's why it's interesting because I'm going to say you have an accent I probably do because I've
and I think that I don't to you but
I was born and raised in texas have lived here forever so I probably do and you're in what city? I'm in richardson it's right outside of dallas
one of my sisters lives in plano
and that's right outside of richardson's right between dallas and plano how about that I probably went through richardson then you probably did
and then I have a sister that lives in austin
but what are you doing way in washington?
we're actually all from nebraska they just are recently moved there my brother in law is director of admissions at the university of texas in dallas that's interesting
and then my sister works at the air force base so I imagine they use personal computers
actually they both have personal computers do they do their correspondence on it?
I think they just send christmas letters on it
as far as I mostly my one sister uses hers for her children children's games are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the
I'll offer anything that I can on the subject my husband and I just moved here recently and we bought this house about year and a half ago what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is completely different from what I had had before when I was working and before I married I lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and historic old houses and things like that so I tried to I was in the process of renovating a house that was about seventy five years old
so it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint everything you can think of that house had to have you are experienced I would say
I really did enjoy it it was amazing what I found out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it I agree
I have done something like that too only not nearly as extensive
but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home after having a one that was historical looking it is it is
that's true when I met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time and the town that I was living in only about eighty miles from here so we really it was just the market was so good we hadn't really planned on buying and as you probably heard in the dallas and texas area period the housing market is just unreal you can get things for such a song
so that's really why we ended up in a house like this this is not what we want to stay in forever because I've found that after doing this other house I have to have my hands into stuff and I'm always just wanting to paint and wallpaper and redo and redo
so I'm ready to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into so maybe you can make that one charming and make a little bit money
that's the key the thing is when we moved in they had just painted wallpapered new carpet and everything so I feel sort of like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because I'm in the mood to do it so we'll see how much longer we're here
we just moved to charlotte from enid oklahoma
oklahoma of all places so I know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned
and I'll tell you we had kind of a charming house it was a cedar shake house and very weathered
and it was about fifty years old but not really traditional looking particularly
so I tried to make it after I sold my business I in I spent almost three years redoing
and I considered it a full time job
it is and when we did we kind of had planned this trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country
I see and so I think some of the things that I did paid off for instance one thing that I did that might even be a good suggestion for you was something I did on the outside
I love old estate sales
I happened to go to just a little estate sale just a little white frame house where the couple was very old and had gone into nursing homes
and all the men started going down to the barn and so I I'm going
that's where I need to go I'm going to the barn too
they auctioned some tools and things like that
but then they went over and started auctioning this big stack of bricks
and so I thought I've been wanting to do some brick walkways for a time work
anyway it ended up after some pretty heavy bidding that I got all those bricks for forty dollars
and so my husband and I loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days
but what we ended up with was about four thousand for forty dollars? for forty dollars
and so what we did we had built a deck on the back of that house
but it needed and it was quite large into the yard something
but on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together
so we made brick patios and walkways
how fun how nice and so for and he did the digging which was about six inches
but I figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and placed most all the bricks
and it turned out beautifully
I bet and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way it nearly killed me
but you did stagger back and say doesn't this look nice I hated to leave it
let me ask you when you laid those bricks I know my parents bought a house about ten years ago they're fixing to sell it again and move again they're kind of my mom's like I am she's a renovator a lover of old things
and they have to be doing something constantly and the patio that came with that house was not laid on a I don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something on top of the sand and then lay the bricks we
but they have a problem with these little sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks I
and of course you have the weeds that come up in between the bricks and things like that I didn't have that trouble because we laid the I did get some material and studied every bit of material that I could study
but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them I see because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of sand
and then we swept sand in between but it was an error to leave an eighth of an inch or whatever
you just put them together as close as you can
as tight as you can that's probably because they had every spring my mom says we're going to have a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to redo the patio we're going to pull up all the bricks
but they just haven't brought themselves to do it
so and I also used a rubber hammer a lot to
if it wasn't quite level or something I'd just get that rubber hammer and
I think that they could if they have problems with sand bugs of some kind I think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a fairly regular basis for a while anyway
the thing that's funny is they've done things like that I'll catch her out there spraying around and then it's like in two days time they'll come home from work and those little things are back it's just they're the most resilient little characters and so I don't know what they're finally going to do she may just hopefully they'll sell the house and go somewhere else
I think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are and then she won't have to worry about it and
what are these things? is it diazinon or what is it that will
dursban or something like that
what it is that'll take care of them dursban
I think in this area or most all areas they use for ticks and fleas
and they're awful hard to do anything with
that's true that's true but my dad farms and she's always telling him isn't there something that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs
but I bet dursban would do it
it might do it she's got just a gorgeous yard so many flowers and her four cats so she's sort of real funny about what she sprays I think you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very well before she lets her cats out or something like that
deb we could talk all day couldn't we
I know it just seems as I said when I heard what the subject was I thought I haven't thought about what I went through at that other house in so long I've been so busy but I don't know of everything that I did I guess I enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and I thought that would be the hardest thing to do
but I ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house up the stairway even
I just had a ball with it
it was so much fun good
and I've sworn up and down my mom's great grandparents had this huge victorian house in paris texas and the one thing that she ended up with was the old door that was on the front door of that house and she has that up in her attic and I have sworn that it I'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does
so as far as looking toward the future that's my plan I'm going to have to move fast though because as a
do you have any pets?
I do I have a dog named grisly who's a ten year old mixed breed between golden retriever afghan hound and chow
and I have a pair of box turtles
I used to have box turtles years ago when I was growing up I really like them
I do too lucky and spot that's their names and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle and always has his nose all around my turtle box
so do you have any pets now? we have one dog a bichon frise our friends in houston bred the dogs I had never heard of them
I haven't either they're all white and they're small and fluffy they don't shed I guess they're distantly related to a poodle but they're not very well known in this country and they're not high strung or over bred
and how big do they get ours is on the small end and she's about ten pounds and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
that's interesting and they love people and kids and that was something we were looking for our love is golden retrievers and that's what we had intended to get in houston but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water we thought that was kind of a tough climate the water
so we ended up getting this and my son would rather have a golden retriever though I think
now he wants a good size dog
we've got a good size dog and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature dachshund and I miss having a little one around
the kind you have sounds very interesting though they're really sweet dogs we thought probably our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of the family that had them and bred them they had five litters of puppies and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because and how do you spell that breed? it's b I c h o n f r I s e f r I s e and how do you pronounce that? bichon frise
I'm writing it out phonetically they're and they don't shed so they're good dogs for people with allergies
and they love people and they're
do they bark a lot? not really ours barks more than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house we used to swap back and forth dogs they have three dogs they had a cockapoo and two bichons
and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there
and now it's funny she's a good watch dog
and if there's she'll bark that way but she also talks a lot she has a definite personality
and so if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left
does she ever mess in the house? and they're very smart dogs the circuses in europe used to use them for the acts
they'll dance on their hind legs each
but they're very easy to train and
and about how much are they? they range I'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars which I thought was a lot
and how about the person in houston?
she's no longer breeding them
but because her dogs the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and the one male that she used had a tooth problem
and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as pets they weren't show quality just pets
that's what we'd rather have is just a pet instead of
we used to show saint bernards when I was a little girl we did that every weekend but takes a lot of time
and it's very expensive but she might have some contacts here I know that the dog's grandmother was from plano
that's where I live that's where I live too
I'm at coit and legacy
what do you usually wear to work?
I am basically retired now
I was a member I was in education and in administration
so basically I wore dresses and heels
and I because my work often took me into court never was one that got accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work but that was just me I know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants
it I guess I was just old enough not to be very comfortable in it
how about you? I work at t I and they don't really have uh dress code so to speak there it's pretty lax about you can pretty much wear whatever you want to and I wear anything from jeans when I'm feeling really casual to suits and dresses when I'm meeting with a customer or I teach training classes and so when I'm teaching a class obviously I wear a suit or dress
so it definitely fluctuates mainly with what I'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is
and when it's raining I'm more likely to wear jeans
and when it's really cold I'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing
but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then obviously when I'm doing anything that I'm in front of people or making presentations teaching whatever I'm going to dress up more
and I think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people I think the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and more classical style of clothing
what about the mini skirt? there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work they're pretty strict about that though I've never worn I just wouldn't even to jeans aren't exactly professional but for some reason a mini skirt is to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like you're showing too much I don't know I wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work
I have seen a few people do it though but they weren't overly and they weren't overly revealing they were pretty much in good taste but
for me I just wouldn't want to do that
there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts
there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee that's what I've seen
and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person as well as the shape of the person's legs
I also even though I retired from education I do modeling and I teach at a modeling agency here
so when we are doing wardrobing we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers in my class
and I always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad
because maybe those are not the clothes that are the most appealing to you or the most complimentary to you
but the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want
and then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy I feel like too on the job when there's men around and some of the managers are men you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily
that's right and to me I just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work but
I have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties
I again maybe because I was at the school there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts
we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers
because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts
and so I think I do not like to see in the corporate areas all the women dressed like men with the suits and white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
I don't like that I don't I think there should be individuality in dressing even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes I like to have just a little something that's feminine
not you don't want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say I am a woman
but I can be professional too
and I don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional
I think that you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong at least in my opinion in the work place
but that you can have a classical look without a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine
because that was one thing I always fought against I started out as a physical education teacher
so I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish
and people would never ever guess that I was phys ed and that pleased me
and so then I of course just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work and I find even at home here now I will wear blue jeans or I'll wear shorts and what have you and be very comfortable but when I go out somewhere then unless I have a pair of dress slacks I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans
I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how
and so I just feel that each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
but there are certain norms that companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees that's one thing I like about t I is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear and your boss doesn't come up to you and say remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit
they leave it up to you and your judgment to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have
the only real restrictions they have are no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the split skirts anything that could be considered shorts they don't allow
that's good and they don't allow any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or anything like that on it but other than that it's pretty lax
and I think that's good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day
or if you want to be comfortable and casual you can and sometimes I think you may be more productive if you're comfortable with what you're wearing and can feel more relaxed whereas sometimes when you're in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and maybe you can't get as comfortable to sit down
and when I'm writing training material I prefer to be more comfortable unless I know I have to meet with a customer later during the day
so I think that is good that they're like that I do know there's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and no variation
and I don't quite agree with that
I don't either fortunately I don't have to work in those companies
but I did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where I was volunteering and they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like men and women they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants and one was a skirt and one was a pant
and I think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality
that's can stifle creativity I agree
it I guess we've talked probably long enough
I guess so it's been nice talking with you nice talking to you too I enjoyed it
the way I'll go ahead and start the way I dress for work this year nineteen ninety one has been really suit and tie
or I shouldn't say suit but coat and tie every day
a year ago I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group
I guess it's a different set of standards
so I dress almost the same every day pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat but it was very different before how do you dress?
I'm a drafter so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes and I have sweatshirt on today
and that's pretty much the norm for me if I come in in a dress everybody's shocked I understand
they ask me what are you doing in a dress and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately ran out of jeans I understand that's funny so does it change? your dress
or I guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that?
so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like
but probably once a month or so there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit for a customer presentation or something
every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in but that's for my husband's job and not mine I see I understand
I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him but that's interesting
let's see what else about this it seems like t I is pretty cut and dried with two or three levels
that there's the upper management that always wears gray suits and the people that don't
if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research and I guess you are
that we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing
but there's not much middle of the road it's nice that there's not a requirement for it
sometimes I think there should be some of these women around here look like they came off of harry hines
I guess you see those once in a while
and they have the no shorts deal and some of these mini skirts are worse than shorts ever thought about being
but I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code that's right that's right I guess they're the isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps I'm not even sure what they are
supposedly and backless things backless
but I've seen those too but so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation but I think we did it
and your name was lisa lisa
are you the expressway sites? I am and I work in the north building thank you thank you
what kind of foods would you have?
I like to cook I do too
but I don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because it's too much pressure
if I have people over for dinner I like it to be nice and relaxed you can't enjoy it
and so I don't like when they arrive for me to be completely worn out that's what I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven it's
everybody just says how wonderful it is and it's I
that's one of those things I got famous for in college people would come and say would you come over and make lasagna for me
it's I can't really give you a recipe
you'd just do it I can just do it I like doing that kind of stuff
and it's fun in fact that's what we had for a christmas party last week
we just had a bunch of people over and we did lasagna and garlic bread and yummy
I like that I do too in fact
I'm planning a and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night
so tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's real easy is just baked potato dinners
and have three or four couples come over and I'll do the potatoes and butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
and it turns out great because you've got hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and bacon and all that good stuff that's fun
but it's inexpensive
plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner
that's a good idea it's real easy I like doing that part
I'm in favor of very little clean up very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games and it's
we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids
and it's fine because then I can just say you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done
and it's pretty cool
that's good one of my favorites is to make chicken and rice it's very easy to
you don't like it? I love it
you do I have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
and you put the chicken in then pour the broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then you just over the uncooked rice? over uncooked rice
and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just how neat
it fluffs up and it's really moist I've done it where you but cook the rice and then take a can of cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it
and every once in a while I'll slice white grapes and I'll put in there and that's just because I'm not a real big wine person but I like it it adds something to the chicken
and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
I'll keep that one in mind
that was one of the first things I made for my husband because I was
I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant kind of
you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner
or semi but then I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice
just in a thirteen by nine pan you put in
let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or
it depends on you can really vary it
but you have to put the water in proportionally I can't remember I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups broth I use that for rice and for when I cook pasta or something I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor flavor that would be good
how long do you have to bake it?
let's see I think it was an hour I've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's really easy I do microwave too a lot
but I think it's about an hour how long would it be in the microwave? or maybe it's only half hour
you just until the rice looks fluffy and not overdone before it gets overdone do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
or do you go ahead and let it cook through?
I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster
this is a beneficial call I like this
I liked your idea too there but that one's an easy one it's like just put in a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup and the wine
put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that however much effort you feel like putting into it
but it makes a great I've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it
because my daughter calls it her gravy and she thinks it's wonderful
good you're a picky eater if I can get you to
the weather certainly has been hot and it's been humid I don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high this late into it's not really late into the summer but the humidity has hung around all of june
are you native to this area? I grew up in michigan but I've been in texas for fifteen years
but I know the summers get hot but it certainly
this humidity has just really hung on there
it seemed like last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in april and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until may kind of pushed the season back a little farther and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity and it just tried to rain I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago and it was trying to rain which seems strange to have it raining in july
normally we don't have too much humidity or rainy time when it's past june that's right that's right I can remember it not it's really august that it happens you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry
and it just gets so dry and the earth opens up I can remember the first year I moved here
and it didn't rain I moved here in late august and it didn't rain from august until december and I went home and told it just doesn't rain in texas
it was great after growing up in michigan and every day was cloudy almost every day was cloudy and you sort of forget how much it did rain and coming here and then it didn't rain it was just wonderful
I lived in ohio mainly I lived in pontiac just a little while before I came down here
and so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade that's right that's right
and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do that's right
what part of michigan were you living in? I grew up in dearborn which is a suburb of detroit
you probably know where that is because I know where pontiac is so
what brought you down here? a teaching job
so you teach in plano schools? I did for a while so I'm home with two children so
new career new career
but so that kind of I had been down here to visit so I school and said let's find a place that has a nice job and that's how it worked out
I think a lot of people were leaving michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus
you know the little joke about will the last person leaving michigan just turn out the light it's a nice place that's a nice place though
I said I lived in the pontiac I didn't live in the city of pontiac I lived to the west of it I forget the county but where all the lakes are around there sort of
I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes it was real close to where I worked it was only four miles to work and it was wonderful being on the lake like that in the summer you feel like you're on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and everybody's out enjoying the water and such and in the winter time the lakes froze over you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes there's lots of really small ones out there
maybe a mile two long
that's enough to do some boating that's right
and it was lots of fun that's right I think lake whitmore is the only one I have real memories of which is
I think it's toward ann arbor so it's probably out in that direction but that's the only one I probably could name after all these years but
but it was just lots of little lakes and of course it was a little more expensive to live on the lake but I just thought that was grand and I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them but there was quite a few lakes all around there it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where I was I said I wasn't close to downtown pontiac I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from the city limits and it was really nice out there
we had pine knob to go skiing and stuff
so there were things around there really was pretty nice and isn't that where they have a summer music festival there too?
in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope that's right that's right I know we used to we didn't do a lot of it but we did
so those are always fun and alpine was it alpine was another ski slope that we went to so it was nice
I always tell people that in the winter we used to my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on make a pond in the backyard for us
but we probably did some ice skating on it but then it chipped and it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven so
we used to have a christmas time some of our relatives would come up from alabama and I think most times we would have snow around christmas and the kids when they were young would just go nuts
because they were from alabama where it never snowed
and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it eternally
if only it would make nice snow here in texas we'd be okay at christmas time
my first winter here I came down in early eighty two and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in december couple days before christmas it lasted only a few hours by noon it was gone
and I remember getting up and somebody telling me better wait to go to work because the roads are all snow and I was laughing going that's a good practical joke
they said really there's snow and there was but a very short time and the weather got warm so quick
it just melted it all away I know
course when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun that's not fun either so I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets but we have
our house is kind of on a little hill so we get the sled out and the kids go down the hill on the sleds when it's icy they just go down the ice
and if it's cold we say out you go I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there
I think it's fun even the couple of ice storms I've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit sometimes the ice is pretty bad but if you get on the grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction not slip and fall first
I don't know what you think about the subject I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the sentencing to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that I've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while I was waiting for them to phone somebody and I don't know that that's not a good idea
that's not a bad idea I that they probably need to change it somehow the whole system needs changing we've just got too many people in there and are putting too many people in jail that probably don't need to be there I agree
and it's another form of sentencing
but on that one thing I still think it should be a unanimous decision I agree
I think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be majority vote and that's not going to be good I don't like that
I don't like that at all I know my husband served on a jury a few months ago up here in denton but it was a drug conviction and I don't remember he had some cocaine and was accused of selling it and I don't remember exactly how much he had but actually not selling it there's a difference couriering it is what is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier and he was a courier
and he sat on that jury and they found him guilty and they went through the sentencing phase and everything and they were told during the trial that this is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record and they ended up the jury decided it's time to crackdown here and it was time to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's really and they sentenced him to fifteen years which they thought that that was a good thing
and they sentencing him to fifteen years and after it was all over they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers and they were told that he would probably serve three of the fifteen and that he had three previous convictions
however they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal
so the jury didn't know about it so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense
so we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson but it's just horrible since it was first offense
and he'd been convicted three times before
and the jury was very upset and my husband came home very upset he felt that they had been tricked
so something I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change
the judge might know or at least it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better if it didn't we can come back for something else or that's true that's very true
or what we've got so
we definitely need a change in the system and obviously what we are doing is not working
it's not working too
it's just piling up on us and there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form
and either they're in there forever or when they get out it's a matter of a few months
and they're going to be right back for the same thing so the system
we're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes so that's very true
I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and I said I understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the united states to and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves
we and I know people say it would be cruel to pull our aid from these other countries and maybe so so tell them you've got five years to work out a plan to make it on your own
and we will continue funding you for the next two years after two years we'll cut it down seventy five percent
and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent and in five years it by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help
and then we will have the money if we would do that to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here
and we're trying to heal the world
very serious it's just not working
you're right I look at the aid presented to the kurds and I feel sorry for them and I know they're suffering and I know they're dying everyday but we've got kids here in the united states that are dying everyday too and being abused and neglected
and I don't know I just have this problem with trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself you bet so
we seem to agree on the jury thing but we'll need an unanimous verdict and maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make a decision I think we should try it like you say
if it doesn't work we can always come back but I think it would be a good idea to try it
I do too so anyway we all agree good
good to hear from you you too
this is a good subject isn't it?
it's something that you can really talk about
I don't know what we're going to do about it but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about
when they say the middle east it's such a big area
and there's so many different problems there what do you want to concentrate on
it doesn't matter to me I'll tell you something I have a sister in law from israel
and they're really quite arrogant about it all they believe that they belong there and they've belonged there forever and the palestinians and the arabs are more or less they consider them second class
they're really quite arrogant about it I don't know if that contributes to the problem
how did they feel about the united states intervening with patriot missiles did they I'm sure this is the one time that the israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the americans
but I didn't really talk about that with her my sister in law now lives in switzerland
but when they were living in israel it was the palestinians they come in and they're nothing but really servants for them and they really treat them like second class citizens they don't really want them around but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such
but they really do they look down on them and I don't know being I live in vermont and being up here we pretty much treat everybody as someone that has merit even if they're poor or if they're hispanic or if they're black we give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities
if I lived in washington d c I think I'd have a different attitude about black people because I've heard that they're terrible it's just like it's a dog eat dog world and here all my black friends are professionals and they don't go out and abuse drugs and they send their kids to school and they really encourage them to go to college and stuff
so it's just a different world
I live in san antonio and fifty percent of the population is minority I talked to someone about san antonio
and they said that you have quite the problem with the ghettos I don't know do they call it the barrio down there
that's the barrios but I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city it's just hispanics here instead of blacks but I heard that it just has a really bad problem
I grew up outside of houston and as far as gang violence and things I don't think it's any worse here than in houston houston me not even knowing anything about houston I would think that it's a pretty calm city
houston is not at all there's a lot of crime?
there's quite a bit of crime we're so protected up here it's really strange our red light district you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life
and we're just so protected but over in the mid east especially israel it's just like israelis have a totalitarian system when it comes to the palestinians the israelis can do anything they want but when it comes to palestinians if they're out in the street at night it's really looked on as odd usually they're bussed in to the jewish neighborhoods and the jewish cities and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories
so they don't have that but what do you think about the mess we've created in iraq?
I think it's unfortunate as far as the kurds are concerned it I it's just what do you do for them you want to do something for them but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the country
we can't get involved in their civil war unfortunately but we've kind of driven these people out to do it but president bush is telling them rebel uprise and that's what they did and now they're asking him for help and he's we can't get involved my husband had very strong feelings he agreed with the general schwartzkopf he said bush should have let him finish his job
he should have let them corner the republican guards
I think the war ended too soon that's what everyone says
everyone I talk to they says it's real easy to say that
we didn't damage enough of their arsenal we damaged most of it but we should have made sure we got everything I don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine they're going it's not going to hurt us so we're just going to let them go but really we didn't think about the people that he was going and he's just
unfortunately though the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of kuwait and once that was accomplished it they stuck right to their goals
and what they were going to say and the american people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that
they were playing it very safe but it an ounce what do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth whatever
schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it the go ahead to do it
because he had the he knew what was going to happen more than any of us because I didn't realize that it was going to make such a mess I feel really sorry for these people these people are middle class people just like us can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood
and you knew this these people are going to come and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you of course you're just going pick everything up that you can carry and you're going to run
and it's just too bad that we couldn't see that
I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet that I still feel like there's more to come I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned you know what I was hoping? I was hoping iran was going to take a very dramatic stand and invade and then iran's the big bad guy but if they were going to save people's lives
they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes I know it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict but I almost swear I'm kind of disappointed with the iranians why they didn't go save I don't know if the kurdish I know the shiites are their people
but I don't know I think they have a bond with the kurds
there are some kurds living in iran I think they should have just done more and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid it's just so complicated
I was real surprised that israel stayed out of it as much as they did you knowing them they're very I don't know almost compare them to a very egotistical man
you're damn right I'm going to protect my family so I was amazed too I was really proud of them though that they stayed out of it but
from what I can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war I that part scared me that the egyptians would pull out and I just saw atomic bomb
what I believe is one of the major things that is wrong with our public school system is that we do not have enough discipline
and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now
I agree with that when I went to school I know I was scared to death about being disciplined you were? and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different
I did not see anybody in my classrooms when I was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom
from what I understand they act up pretty bad that's right that's right
what grade is your daughter in? my daughter's in the fourth grade
and there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher can not teach
and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with
they always had a paddle in our school
they just don't do that any more
I know but the school system's afraid of getting sued and all sorts of lawsuits because of things like that
and I also believe even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money put in toward public school
and I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems
wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for if we approve it?
supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for and we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not
I don't know your feelings toward that I guess we shouldn't get into that and what else I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire
I have heard stories from other parents that I know of that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs
I've heard some horrible horrible stories about high school teachers
and to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school
that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system
with what they have to work with I think they're doing a pretty good job right now
I do too I think they're doing real good job so but then what do I know you don't have any children in school? don't have any kids I don't have any kids
none at all so this is probably a real hard subject for you
I guess we can discontinue our call now
it was a joy in talking with you
it was good talking to you too we'll see you do you exercise a lot?
it's scaled back considerably right now my exercise is pretty much limited to softball league and occasional ride on the bike but I just nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot is mowing the lawn a new exercise?
lawn it's a forty year old house so we are doing a lot of refurbish work
and painting lawn gutters you name it all kinds of stuff flower beds I think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not
that's true that's true there's always something to do and it keeps me going but you are so far ahead of me
I used to walk two miles a day
and I really enjoyed it
because the two miles went fairly quickly I could do it in twenty eight minutes
and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way
but it's a lot it's not too strenuous and I could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but I don't know what I did to my knee I was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer
and I mashed it wrong or I did something
and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's while it's healing you're going to mess it up so I can't walk
and she said the most conservative approach you do the medicine again and again before you think of surgery
and I don't want her to think of surgery on my knee I don't want anyone to think about that ever
that's a tough situation that's that microscopic stuff not my kneecap
so I'm being very good
but I miss it I really do and I
that it's so aggravating to have an injury like that my wife likes to run but she's we moved down to the north end of oak cliff in the castle park area
and she started running down there and all the hills
and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldn't take it anymore she was used to running flat tracks and whatnot and ever since that it's just been real difficult it's real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff even if she does get on flat ground so she's kind of in the same mode she was all ready to get back into it and start running five k's and ten k's and stuff this spring and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape and when you want to do it it's really really aggravating it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it's another thing to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health can you understand that
I don't really want to I just know I need to
it's I make myself do it and if I do it I don't love it but I will do it
it's not anything I would want to but I can really tell the difference since I have not been able to walk I have got to be so much more careful with what I do it's depressing
it is and you don't well speaking for myself I don't sleep as well when I am not exercising and it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff your body just gets used to it I don't particularly enjoy it I used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that I do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that I can't say I really enjoyed it all that much but once I got used to it it was habit forming it was I felt so bad if I didn't physically I mean I just my body was tuned into that mode and if I skipped it then it kind of threw the whole system out of whack
hopefully my knee is a hundred percent better maybe I can get back into it
that's for sure let me ask you a question off the subject though
you're living in the castle park area? that's right I grew up in oak cliff
did you really? I did just close to methodist hospital on candy c a n d y
in fact I lived there until late nineteen fifties
and that area is it changing back again? so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
it is we're on a little street called bison trail it's only about a block and a half long but it's over on the other end it's over by the far edge of stephen's park golf course I know exactly where that is
it's you know where the little bridge is on north oak cliff boulevard?
we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there and our street is an awful lot of retired people but the other half in fact our one little block and a half there four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their late twenties to mid thirties are buying and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited that's wonderful
that is a gorgeous gorgeous place
it's a lot of fun the people are great there too we've got a real active neighborhood association and we've got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and all that kind of stuff so it's a lot of fun and it's a really beautiful area and some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and they're getting them at a real bargain they are
you know they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars
and they're just going to town with them people are putting in pools and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original nineteen thirty nineteen forties look
and it's really coming around I guess I need to go over there and just drive around and look
it's worth the trip I'm sure it must be I'm just we had a lovely little house over there it was a two story
story and a half really because we had a basement
and the guy that built it was weird I mean weird
it's one of these really creative houses that I grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else
and I just loved the neighborhood
and everyone had houses like that they were all completely different
that's right and so neat
ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big it's twenty eight by fifteen front porch
next door we've got an austin stone across the street the guy it was burnt out about two years ago and the guy moved in and completely redid it's got a rounded front on it it's all brick and he's landscaped his yard and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that so there's a variety you just don't see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot why couldn't your wife run around the golf course? is that not good?
she could a little bit we I tell you what we got into the fitness center at methodist and they have a quarter mile track there so she has started doing that rather than take off the problem is she's a school teacher and for her she can't run in the morning for her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night in the winter time it's starting to get dark and you don't want to she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in dallas regardless whether it's north dallas or whatnot when she goes over to this fitness center it's fenced in and there's somebody in the building watching her and all that so there's a lot of consideration I really hear that I think you're in oak cliff
but I'm in plano in west plano
and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block
we all know each other and the street doesn't go anywhere
if you are on the street you better belong there because it's not a through street that's right that's right and still I want to get up early in the morning and walk before this knee business
and my husband had a lot of heartburn with that
it looked darker to him because he was in the house with the lights on
when I was out walking it was more of a predawn type pretty but he didn't think it looked predawn to him it looked dark
and even he was real concerned about that so it's not just because you are in oak cliff it's just because you're smart that's true that you don't do things like that it only takes one time that's right
it's a hard lesson to learn there's only one crazy out there to make any difference
it goes all over you got the
how many credit cards do you have?
I think I'm down to one I wish I was that way is that why you said I had more experience than you?
I was pulling your leg how do you use your credit card? do you just keep it in reserve or
I the way I'd like to try and use it is you make your purchases at prime buying time
and then you pay that off and don't use it until it's paid off
that's my ideal way how do you use it?
emergencies come along and I use it
that's understandable
my car had a major problem and seven hundred dollars
and things just come up
and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have and I use them my american express I use for gas things like that and I pay that off monthly and then some other credit cards like store credit cards I do have them up there a little bit but
I try not to use them too often but living in this area I live fifteen miles west of washington d c
it's a very expensive area
so sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something
I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble
so we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it
I just that was good that you had the opportunity to do that
are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card or?
we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there
our only credit card is sears and I have that for automotive purposes
that's great everyone I know here uses credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you
it's just too easy basically just get yourself in trouble with those the only other one I have I have a diner's club through where I work I see so that I use because I travel some so I use that and I don't really have to worry about that because I only use it for business so I automatically have the money to pay it off but
I wouldn't mind getting back into one if they would you start out at a low limit and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit
and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that then that's fine
but they eventually gets up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand
forget it I don't want that the temptation's too great
so I don't know just writing checks is just as easy I guess that's true that's true so I guess we've kind of exhausted this topic
what can you you can't say too much about it really
other than you use them or you don't use them you like them or you don't like them so
I guess they don't care if we end it early so hopefully you have a good thanksgiving that's coming up and then maybe we'll talk again you too
may be you're the furthest person actually that I've talked I've talked to a lot of people in texas
texas is the big one so then
I guess which one have you got right now? or
I couple of them I at the moment use an a s t two eighty six and I got a leading edge and I got a american one and had a I b m one but just a couple
what do you have? I've got an omega and I've got a generic four eighty six machine
it's very very generic
what did you do put it together? and upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled and now it's a fast machine that's
that's all I got to say for it
what do you use it for?
what do you use it for? work I'm a contract programmer
what kind of programs do you anything
business programs or I've done business programming scientific applications like petroleum science stuff and test equipment
and I did one that was the demonstration of a touch screen for a company that sells touch screens it was kind of fun
put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display and make it look like things like attack simulators and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for that's
that sounds interesting
matter of fact I guess you get a lot of graphics in there
that's where the speed helps out unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty eighty six it's slow
that will slow you up
I do programming for c n c turret presses and cat cam system type things
and really need a faster system I got a new line that I sell metal fabricating equipment and cat cam systems and tooling et cetera
I know a guy that upgrades for a reasonable cost
who is that? his name is t q or something like that and my notebook is somewhere around here see if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough
I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one he's up in
that's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them they not only give me a demonstrator but the hardware as well as the software
and as they go to the next one I just keep the that works
that's why I have so many different levels of p c s around at the moment here it is a t s computers a t s?
and where are they at? do you know where custer is?
he's south of renner on custer
and there is a little bitty mall or strip kind of center in richardson there in richardson?
I know where you mean there is a mobil and all that kind of on that one corner that's about lookout there isn't it it's just south of there
it's a little place looks like a castle
kind of little guy in there he gives reasonable prices
I traded my three eighty six for the four eighty six for about six hundred
that's a good deal it was pretty reasonable
but he and he does a good job and he guarantees everything he sells
there is a lot you ever go by lucky computer there?
I used to when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems
haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so so I don't know where those guys are at these days but I they're up there in that mall just below campbell or that strip center
they're still doing business big business apparently
I tell you those prices have just unbelievably come down I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty six for six hundred even with a trade in it's like wow
that works I'll go do that
I and that thing screams now
I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed the three eighty six
that wasn't alive for but maybe two years I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty six s x even though the price difference is about ten dollars
is that right? that's it? when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks I'll be darned
I don't know which end do we push but
let's see I think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their opinion is going to be heard and there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the united states and that their vote's not going to make that much difference and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you believe in and that person is going to have a lot of since there's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them
so it would be really difficult to have that one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed that's true a lot of people I think that it ends up the people that vote every time elections come around are more the party type followers the guys that follow the party lines and they just go in
and if they're republican they vote republican every year and the people that are independent are the ones that don't really show up every year because they can't seem to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate
that's good I always thought it was back when anderson was running I was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but that didn't work
there's a lot of extremes on the parties too with the real far side of the democrats they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago the democrat party being liberal like they are now would never be thought of it would be the other way that the republicans were real liberal minded as far as moral standings and those kinds of things
but that's and then people always get upset about it too because every year the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote
they each think that if more people vote they'll get more votes?
I'm always amazed that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him
that's true I think in the texas governor elections more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time that I know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately catholic type area
and when things start when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all inspired
and still on the other hand we're also this particular community is a catholic community but down in d c where things are a little bit different it's women's rights and that sort of movement and so it's quite the opposite so elections start getting very the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones that's true but
that's true that the different places in america that different issues would be a lot more important than in another place I can understand why some of the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in d c are controlling things for the midwest
and it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to the pressure that the lobbyists can put
and it's real true that they'll say one thing to get elected
and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised beforehand
maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place like the no new taxes thing that's with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to even try to do
I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected after the war
that really unfortunately that will probably even drop lower the voters turndown even more because more democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out
that's true they'll just say the republicans have this election we'll see you in four years
hope some of the local that's what they keep saying that it seems like people with old fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the booths they say that these older voters that they feel like the kids are running the country so they don't turn out to vote and they're the ones that really know what's going on have the experience and seen how politicians can screwup or what ever
but I know my grandmother hasn't voted in years
that's neither has mine as a matter of fact and that's true I think they look at it as everybody the majority of the people think this way when that's not necessarily true because that's what the media says
the majority believes this way so they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their opinions so that's true wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children bouncing in your knee the whole time you're talking
do you hear the dogs in the background here? I can't hear them
they're the children next door just opened the fence and they went off
but anyway that's I guess we've talked long enough and that was sort of interesting
what part of the country are you from? washington d c are you really?
this is I'm from this is dallas where I'm at
the outskirts of dallas I figured with texas instruments they'd probably have a few texans on the line now and then
do you work for t I in any way?
how did they get you? they went through engineering companies
and we're communications I work in a communications company
I work for t I so we saw it on the t news one day and I thought that might be interesting sort of different
they called me at ten o'clock one night that was very strange
I guess they were doing eastern standard time I was like I don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes
central standard time is what they're doing it by
I still haven't figured out the zero through six days which day is which yet but I didn't study it that hard
so maybe I'll figure it out
but it was nice to talk to you and sort of meet you and that was an interesting topic
if you're ever in d c come look up wayne sherman you'll say talked to that guy
I'm kyle hunt too if you ever come to dallas area
we live right by the airport so do we
right next to dulles
I'll talk to you later where do you get most of your news?
I watch the macneil lehrer news hour and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends where are you? I'm in dallas
are you in dallas also? I'm in san antonio
I get my news from a combination of sources I take the paper every day
and I read it on the way in to work in a carpool
and actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work and then usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news
I normally find that I'm probably the most news hungry of my friends so we don't normally talk about the news at lunch I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because I used to get it during the week
but I would always end up arriving at work late because I would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning
so I have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television
and I enjoy that quite a bit one of the women that I work with her husband is iranian
so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch
I will admit I work with someone who's iranian and he definitely has a very different slant on the news
he's very very skeptical of the news media and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also but he's much more so it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a much different perspective with all the gulf goings on he was always speaking in terms of american imperialism reasserting itself I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country I like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize
true the I understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't
they tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story
they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like a b c's nightline
I guess they only normally stick with just the one story but they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in every little town
it's very much national interest news
a lot of times they end up with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that I don't know the value of that because I saw plenty of jokes and editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making a living during the gulf war I've been getting a kick out of those lately
although I'm only twenty five so I've never actually been through a period of war
and I don't know anyone in the military and I don't have a lot of background knowledge in military strategy and weaponry and all that kind of stuff and I thought the generals were very interesting when they started to speculate I saw that for what is was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on
but I thought they were interesting and they shed some light on what was going on for me
I will admit it's interesting I'm twenty six so I don't have any more experience in that than you it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it
and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world which I suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a national soap box to stand on and express this view one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b c and it was for children
and it was hosted by peter jennings and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions and they had all their correspondents in the different areas in saudi arabia and israel and all they had them all on line they had them all on hold
and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very informative and interesting and I was real impressed at how a b c handled translating the war for children
I didn't see anything like that although I did I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting this is getting a little off the topic but there was a big push with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with counselors to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children
I thought that was a really unusual thing and our local h e b stores here I don't know if it's h e b statewide or whatever but they have videos that I don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war it was
with the children's aspect? it was something for children that they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing
I suppose that is a valuable service again not having lived through another war I don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was a new concern with people back during the viet nam conflict that no one will have the guts enough to call a real war
that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal that's true that's true so I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news
and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that people's interest didn't flag too badly I tell you what the first three days I was glued to the television I will admit the same thing and I would come home and flip on macneil lehrer and I
and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program
and I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing I tell you what the war let's see was it a wednesday or thursday? must have been thursday and friday night I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
because I was watching c n n and they would switch back to one of their israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just I was amazed
I didn't have that experience I don't have cable
so I'm pretty much limited to p b s which I thought they did a very good job
I've got one question for you you say you take the newspaper
I found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting we've got the one relatively weaker paper the times herald and then the morning news which has a very strong subscription
does san antonio you said san antonio?
do you have just one paper or do you have several? there are two and they're pretty close the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper I grew up near houston
and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff
it's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over and I enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper this newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of so
I actually take both newspapers on the weekends do you?
I figure I'm only taking on the weekend and I can afford that
I find the news reporting in the morning news to be better but I sort of have a liberal political slant and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial outlook and my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers I get the times herald just to balance that out a little bit he takes both san antonio papers an austin paper both houston papers I guess he takes seven the san marcos paper and the new braunsfel paper but he's a football coach at southwest texas state university so he's getting all the sports sections
and he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread
on this subject of invasion of privacy it's very easy for anybody to find out about you your
I don't really like that very much the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast last week or so ago it detailed how this one person went about finding out from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are his social security number driver's license any kind of records he may have their credit card and the status of their credit what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff? it was just as a demonstration to show those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person
and it was mostly it dealt with marketing companies these direct marketing associations
that was the primary subject that's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets their habits their hobbies their income
and they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer
that's not really good I don't know I guess that's an invasion of privacy I'm not sure that that's an everyday thing though at least not for an individual
something that I feel is pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now is the open office concept the open office?
where they have the little partition dividers throughout a large room
and people have little cubicles that's all fine and good but you don't really have any privacy at all not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody because you can easily be overheard
and they get I suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen there is
and it's not just that it's the whole thing about if you're trying to concentrate it's rather hard sometimes it's almost impossible to do because your space is not your own space
and I work in a situation like that and I really kind of have a problem with that do you work with mixed company male and female or
is there anybody who doesn't? there are a few out there
I suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at
but my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles there's nothing to block anything
so but I guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record
or the computers the big advent of that because they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button and it appears in front of them
and you don't have to I know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families
that's no secret and it shouldn't be that way
I don't think that's quite right either it's not really government for the people and by the people I'll tell you that
what do you think could be done about it? the only way it can change is if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office
the only thing that can be changed is for everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go but I don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that
it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done I don't know it's still a free country insofar as we're able to obtain information and I wouldn't be for total banning of all information or it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about but it's hard to define a lot of those boundaries
it really is it's something that I've just had a dealing with is a credit bureau
they take my name which is a very common name and my last name is even more common
and they check that name against their list and they find several and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name so you've received a lot of flack?
they don't even check my social security number
and companies are paying them good money to report accurately and they're not they're so lazy they're just not doing it they just find your name and they match it up
and that just drives me crazy because they're and then they want then to get it removed they say you have to write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them and then it takes three weeks and all and I'm baloney you messed it up you fix it is that usually what you tell them in the letter?
what I've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report
recently I was reported as having j c penney accounts and I don't so I called j c penney and I said I just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them and they say uh huh because they really don't want to pay for a service that's not being done properly either
so then they can call the credit bureau and say we're paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job good idea
so that's what I've taken to doing lately and it seems to work pretty well so far that's good any other problems?
not that I can think of I guess I've just about run out of
I can probably go on but it's I'm clouding up right now
I probably better let you get back to work it's nice talking to you maybe again are you there?
do you know the question for today?
it's about why there aren't more people that are voting and participating in and what is your feeling? do you think this is vital important? do you
I think that it's kind of discouraging to I have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea even that there's an election and these are people that are registered I have worked in some campaigns
and it's the most discouraging thing in the world I'm originally from oklahoma and up there if they miss three elections then they have to reregister and I have often wondered if maybe that would help the situation I don't know
that's a thought can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people?
I don't know I like that idea I had a thought just a second ago but it slipped my mind that's all right
probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates and I think sometimes that's one thing that I have learned in working in elections and things is sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like I know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for and when they got in office it was just a disaster
and I'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them I'm not the only thing is if they don't vote they have no right to complain
it is I don't know why we are so complacent but I'm going to vote each time right or wrong I'm going to cast a ballot and then if I'm unhappy with it I have the right to express my opinion
that's right so there was something else I was going to and I'm like you I've just lost a train of thought that I had but they have been little more effective in oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it
if you just skip one election? three
three you have to skip three
and of course they can be a long time apart but
I think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it of course but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting?
no excuse I'm not sure if I'm familiar with that or not I'm sure all over the state of texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting
and you don't have to be sick out of town or anything there is no excuse anyone can go and vote
I think that's great do you?
my husband has run for office before and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because if you're going to be tied up that day campaigning or whatever it might be that just kind of takes that load off you can just go ahead and get that taken care of and but that is an excuse I could live with
but this idea of anyone I am so bitterly opposed to this if you're busy that has always been a legitimate excuse if you are incapacitated ill health
but to have the expense of let's see they have five six people at my polling place they can come from all over the city and I don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this
hopefully once they've checked them off the list they do have to check them off a list when they vote I know
so hopefully they couldn't but is every list checked as thoroughly as a we back in when I lived
when they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank I thought I haven't taken anything back for a long time
I haven't either I hate returning things
I have a friend who if she likes something isn't sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and take everything back again
it's a game to her but I do not like to do that I consider it kind of a waste of my time and so I'm usually pretty careful when I shop
and I also usually have checked over things if it's an appliance or something to make sure it has the features in it that I want
we've had one lately a dustbuster plus that we bought
and we've had it for a while but all of a sudden it just wasn't working and it looks like there's a part missing from it my husband opened it up and whatever and of course we don't have the receipt any more so we can't take it back of course
but I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
we're a wasteful society for sure
that's true and lot of times though it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one if it's
and you usually get what you pay for we bought some walkie talkies a couple of years ago for christmas and they were ten dollars and we expected them to work nice for the little kids and they didn't work worth anything
we took those back and that's about that all that were taken back in ages
I think a lot of times if you get a brand name if it's a good brand
I think there can be a lemon in anything but I think more often than not
you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time and if you buy a good one you shouldn't have too much of a problem with it
we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do it's hard
we never could get it declared a lemon and the car would go and without any warning whatsoever you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
and I there was just and we went round and round with the manufacturer and everything and they got it finally semifixed but it was such a hassle and it just pertained to that
it really is but of all the topics I have had this is kind of the strangest one at first I thought of food because that's mainly what I buy it seems like and I still don't have anything to do there but I think too a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one so
I think that's true and now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it my husband is really good at fixing things too so he usually be able to fix anything that's minor and that has saved us thousands of dollars from to mechanic to anything like that
but it was interesting to I don't know if they're making them better or not it's hard to say I think they more of their parts plastic which makes things break easier but I think the technology is better
I think technology is better I'm not sure I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that about quality
I don't think necessarily that things are being made better
I everything is so automated and things can be made without a human hand ever touching it an awful lot of things
and I think that certainly makes a difference back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and had some pride in it people aren't willing to pay those prices very often for a handcrafted something that's true so
so if we get what we deserve
I do craft work and sell stuff at shows and it's a real eye opener as far as why people charge what they do to
who's your favorite team? my favorite team is the pittsburgh steelers pittsburgh? you bet I used to be a big pittsburgh fan when I was little
I when john stallworth played he was from my hometown in alabama
so I kind of grabbed on to that team way back when that's pretty nice
that's good I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big steel curtain that's right
how about your favorite team? last year it was buffalo and I still try to keep up with buffalo because they just impressed me as being so efficient and they never score they never blow out their opponents they just score just enough points
and that really impressed me but then down here I is pretty close to new orleans and I've been keeping up with the saints a lot
they are exciting aren't they? the saints are starting to impress me this year a lot
they are just a fun team to watch they are really did you see the game sunday afternoon?
I didn't it was funny they a fireworks display at halftime
and some paper or something in the super dome up in the roof caught on fire
you're kidding so they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire
those big piece of something came falling out of the roof and landed on the field so there's this big fire on the field and they were dumping the gatorade bucket and everything
I can't believe that it was you just really can't tell what's going to happen that's hilarious I know it's like about two weeks ago I was watching the saints
and morton anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal
and it was beautiful right down the middle
he is tough he has an incredible leg he is
do you think they're going to be able to make it this year past the first playoff game? I sure hope so
I'm not sure who they play right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams
who's that? it's pretty much going between washington and buffalo new orleans and chicago because chicago has only lost twice
and one of those was to buffalo and they beat the saints their only time they lost
what do you think about houston? houston I saw houston play this summer in memphis
from what I saw they were playing when I was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the houston oilers
and from what I saw the game houston impressed me a lot
but my brother watched it on t v and said that warren moon was just having an off night and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night
he definitely is one of the best I think he's
their backfield is really impressive haywood jeffreys and drew hill and allen
they really impress me
they squeaked out a game on sunday that's right who did they play? they played dallas dallas that's right they won in overtime all because that's right I remember that now
so that was I watched that game and that was do you have a favorite between those two?
because I'm right here in dallas I kind of pull for dallas
also houston is in pittsburgh's division so I'll almost always root against them that's true I hate to say it but I hate dallas
that's okay I was never really a big dallas fan until we moved here
and they just kind of grew on me I imagine that's the way I've never been a big saints fan until the last year or two and they've actually started doing something
so I've actually paid attention to them
do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in?
to tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that
what cities are they looking at? right now I think this memphis they're trying to get the teams
and that's where I was when I saw houston play
saint louis is trying to get a team baltimore is trying to get a team and there's some other city I'm wanting to say raleigh durham but I'm not sure
I think you are right I think it is raleigh think so?
I think I remember hearing that because I know they've got a football team but I think it might be them
that would be fun I'd like to see some more teams get in I would definitely I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after and right now I think it's memphis and baltimore have a really good shot at it
because I know saint louis is much bigger than memphis and when I went up there they were saying that memphis sold more tickets than saint louis did
it's like the liberty stadium in memphis holds about sixty two
I'm not I read a lot but I don't read a whole I tend to read only out of a couple groups
and I'm a big baseball fan so I tend to read a lot of the baseball books and
I'm a big baseball fan too
and I read a lot of science fiction
I like I teach school and so during the school year I just don't have time to read and I would love to be able to read more because I enjoy it so much but with correcting papers and two kids of my own I just don't have time but in the summer I try to read a lot
and of course being a woman I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot I just I really enjoy that because it's kind of a getaway type thing
so I read a lot of that but I also love sports and I don't have time to read in but I do read sports illustrated during the year because my son gets that
and but I don't read a lot of nonfiction and I really should because there's so many self improvement books out right now that would benefit me greatly but I just don't I don't really I probably should I don't really read the self improvement books or things like that I'll get books on history and stuff like that that look interesting and of course I don't ever get around to reading them
I got I belong to quality paperback book club
do you? and I'll get stuff out of that I got battle cry of freedom a couple of years ago
and I started reading and got about sixty pages into it and it's eight hundred pages
and it was I want to read something else for a while
it's some of those books are real tough to get into but after you get into them they're really good
but it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so especially battle cry of freedom starts off in the eighteen forties and it's
the war wasn't until the it's okay and I realize these things these things take awhile to move up but it's hard sometimes
it's right that's right I find though that when I find an author and you don't read a lot of fiction you said but when I find I read a lot of science fiction do you?
when I find an author I really like I try to read everything they write because you get used to their style and you really enjoy it that and I do the same thing I
there's one science fiction writer named allen dean foster
I've heard of him he I must have fifty or sixty books by him
is that right? I have almost everything he's ever done
and I know that when I get his book I'm usually going to enjoy it
so it's really it's fun to do that
isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction? I think that's unbelievable he does a lot of movie adaptations and things like that
does he really? and his adaptations are usually really good
it's funny he the novelization of star wars was it was out in the stores as being by george lucas but it turns out that foster actually ghost wrote it for him
is that right? which when I read it I should have realized that because it had foster's style written all over it is that right?
I've never read anything of his but I've heard about him but wouldn't you think he would does he get some royalties from that hopefully? I'm sure he does
I would think he would I'd hope so I mean he's doing all right probably
I'm sure he is I'm sure he is but sometimes the more you get the more you want too so that's true
you're a baseball fan you're aware of that kind of thing
in fact I'm a sports fan period
we that's why I like to read sports illustrated so much because there's everything in it I had a subscription to that last year but I'm mostly a baseball fan so I'm not as
the other stuff is interesting but I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff
you're probably a baltimore fan an oriole fan? actually I'm a red sox fan more than anything is that right?
boston? that's good too but I do like the orioles also
I'm sure you do I'm a ranger fan simply because I live here
but I was I'm not from here I'm originally from ohio so I've always followed the tigers because I was born and raised in toledo toledo
I was in toledo last summer went to a mud hens double header
I love the mud hens they're great I love the name and there was a really big article on the mud hens in sports illustrated last year I saved that issue actually
did you? that's when I had the subscription it was a lot of fun
I I really enjoy that team we used to go there all the time I used to live in iowa too and they have the iowa oaks and we used to go to their games all the time and they don't exist anymore I don't think I know they don't at least not by that name there's the iowa cubs but I don't know if they play in the same location
they must have changed then because it used
I haven't lived there for I've been here for twelve years now and I haven't been back to des moines in a long time but we used to always go to their games
and it was kind of fun it's almost more fun than going to a major league game I don't know I just really enjoy the farm teams I minor league baseball is a lot more fun than major league baseball
it is it's not quite so serious and it's a lot cheaper
that's for sure that's for sure there's a city just west of baltimore called frederick it's about forty miles west
is that right? and they have a minor league team and I go out there almost as much as the orioles and
is that right? I it's just a lot of fun it's free parking and four bucks now to get in and the hot dogs are a dollar and it's just great
how much is an oriole game? oriole game? if you park in the lot across the street from the stadium it's four bucks the cheapest ticket you can normally get is six fifty to seven fifty
it's higher than the rangers and hot dogs start at a dollar fifty
the food here is outrageous but you can get a good seat for it used to be three dollars but I think it's gone up to four dollars this year that's nice
but it's in the bleachers way out in center field but it's still nice
you still can see well and we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets box seats or something then we usually sit out there
how much are the box seats there? do you know offhand?
box seats run from eight dollars to twelve dollars that's a little steeper I think the most expensive seats in memorial are eleven bucks but we're getting a new stadium next year so
so it'll go up it'll go up and if it opens it's something we're really irritated about around here or some people are really irritated about they built the new stadium downtown and they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium
but I park for free up at memorial stadium because I know where I can do it for free
and I'm not going to be able to do that downtown that's a bummer we
baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the cowboys it's outrageous to go to the cowboy game
and the mavericks are it's high too so baseball's cheap compared to other games weren't you guys supposed to get a stadium in downtown dallas?
that didn't go over it didn't go through
george bush who's the main owner of the rangers decided that they'd stay in arlington
so arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one
so they're going to stay there which is fine because arlington's got a lot of things to offer and that was their main money making deal for the city
and it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away
because everything there's six flags right by the stadium there's a wet'n wild and that's
all the tourists come there
and they it would have been devastated they would have collapsed so I'm kind of glad they're staying there because it's right in the middle of fort worth dallas and that's what I'd always heard I've
I like it there and I think dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything so I'm glad that they're staying in arlington
and it's takes us maybe thirty five to forty minutes to get there from plano which is not too bad at all that's about what it takes me to get to memorial
it actually funny that I live just outside of baltimore
and it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to frederick as it does to go to the ballpark in baltimore because to go out to frederick I just jump on the interstate is that right? and because I live just south of the interstate
hop on the interstate and the stadium's right off the interstate
so it's I drive west and I'm there and and then to go into baltimore it's fewer miles but I've got to go stop and go traffic and everything
do you read I guess you read sports illustrated but you don't read many sports books or
not really my son does I have a son that just turned sixteen
and he reads everything he get his hands on he's reading a dick vitelle book right now because he's a real big dick vitelle fan
he's a basketball fan because he plays for the high school he goes to and just loves dick vitelle which not many people do
but he's reading it and he's and he says he's so interesting mom you just can't believe all the things he's done
and he's really enjoying that and I and he said mom you need to read it after I get finished so maybe I will I understand there was a really good basketball book called a season on the brink
I never heard that one I'm not sure I don't know I'm trying to think of the guy's name it was john feinstein or something like that wrote it
I just heard about it the other night
I was listening to something on the radio about a talk show about sports books
and they mentioned that one
I'll have to tell my son about that I'm sure he'd like it and I was thinking about I saw a book kicking around on the history of the a b a which
that would be good even when I don't like the sport so much I get interested in the history of sports franchises push my number
are you a golfer or are you a spectator? I'm a I play golf but I don't actually play golf
I'm the same way I go out there and hit the ball hack it all over the place?
it's sickening isn't it?
in the carolinas it's just we've got a bunch of golf courses around here we've got tons up here but I don't know how do you feel about your game? I guess that's a good question?
I'm not a serious golfer at all a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and I don't really even have a game I usually when I go out and play golf it's usually at one of these par threes that you
but I like watching it on t v I like that too
if I can hit a great deal my friends I don't know I try to play but a couple years ago I played two three times a week and got lousy I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy and I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come and then I got worse again so
to get me they say I hit worm burners because I can't hit it up in the air
I'm pretty bad but I get great distance hitting it across the ground and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm but I'm getting better I've got where now I can hit it in the air some of the time that's pretty good
so I'm kind of a novice at it I'm that and worse I play next year I actually I take it kind of seriously but I've been doing so bad next year I'm starting over from scratch I'm going to go take lessons and everything I'm going to do it right and see if I can actually play this game or not
I guess that's what I need to do is get some kind of lessons or something because my tee off is not bad I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just that initial tee what do you do when you're putting? that's a good thing that's something I could learn actually that's when I do my worst I finally get to the green and I think I'm doing all fine and then
just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really checking the ground and so forth see how it's going to break or whatever can you really see it though?
what about the speed?
if you get down on the ground you really can but can you tell how fast you're going to hit it?
you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction but you can feel that?
I don't know I can get it within four or five feet or something but I don't have enough field now I'm t v watching
they make you die at the hole every time
it just dies and rolls in I don't know but I it's hard for me
the it's like I said once I get up on the green I'm fine but that tee shot it when teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it takes me awhile to get to the hole but once you're there you're all set though I'm all set we should play team golf then I'll get us there and you put it in
that sounds good to me I the t v golfers they do that it takes them two to get there and two to get it in so it's fifty percent and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in
it usually takes me about probably two or three to get it there and then that's according to the hole and it maybe one or two putts it's according to where I'm at on the green that's good
but the friends I play with they play all the time and they're really good joe pros?
they're not joe pros but they golf in the high sixties low seventies so I guess they're pretty good that's pretty good for eighteen?
for eighteen that's pretty good
I'm talking to the wrong guy your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen
that's not my golf that's my friends mine I'm usually in the eighties or nineties so I'm not good when I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good I'm usually around a hundred that's my thing around a hundred I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole but it ain't going to happen
teeing off I either slice it or I hook it ever single time and I alternate it's a good thing with me I slice it every single time that's good I aim
what is do you have a favorite recipe? that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe it says what you would have for a dinner party this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin
maybe we're all set we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end it says what you would have for a dinner party I just happen to plan one out for saturday I'll tell you what I'm going to have if I can find it that's wonderful
I have this new fondue pot and I was going to do basic cheese fondue and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham and I was going to try something weird which when you have fish au gratin I was going to make some fish chunks and dip it in the fondue I don't know if it will come out
that's what kind of fondue the cheese dip or the cheese fondue I make some people like swiss I prefer cheddar and I'll mix I won't have a sharp cheddar because for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar
and then I was going to make other things like potato skins
that sounds good you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff and I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a vegetable
that's always a good thing vegetable trays always go over so well because I think people get tired of eating junk I think they like to have healthy stuff too it's it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party
I think better even than other kinds of food instead of something greasy or
my girlfriends do catering and always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray I think they try and suggest it
what I've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something I make food kabobs you take little toothpicks and cut up pineapple and strawberry and even banana if you can do it just before you leave
it stays nice and fresh
that's true or even have you ever seen where they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat I like those
they made a couple of those they made one for my bridal shower and I was pretty pleased I never made one for myself though but they look easy enough to make it's not
I think it would be a lot of work because it's
you have to cut each thing or use the melon baller and stuff but I think they're really neat and I think they're worth the time because they you get probably pretty sticky after you get done
then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because when you scrape it it makes the water
something I do is I'll make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them I have two nieces and they go melt some chocolate chips go buy me some strawberries
is that good? I've seen that so many times strawberries dipped in chocolate but I've never tried it are they really good? if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better but if you get a sour strawberry
I bet it doesn't mix well does it? the strawberries are coming in season now from they're coming up from florida of course I live in vermont but they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from florida so
that's good because I know they've been really expensive lately because they weren't in season
of course they had to be grown in greenhouses and stuff and in actually I think they get some of them from south america
is that right? they a lot of winter produce comes from south america
I of course their seasons are switched
do you want to discuss the recipe?
I have a recipe if you want
it filled a lot of people try to stay away from this but I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding
is that right? I've never heard of that and it if you first of all I take about a quarter and a half of milk and I put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat
and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it ends up burning no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot
I don't let that worry me and I get the milk lukewarm and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and I have this thing it's called the slender blender it makes a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough it's I don't know they're called moo goo leaves or something they're
I think I know what you're is it a hand held? they're real neat
the I think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but I didn't get that one I got the black and decker kind but it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the milk and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it I guess you could use a hand mixer but I don't think it gets it good enough
and then before the milk gets too hot I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar and I let it pretty much I beat it every minute for about ten seconds and it starts thickening when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little it gets little globs of this rubbery cornstarch
and you just keep beating it in and it's the the trick is to have this blender so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened I cook it for a good once it starts boiling I cook it for a good seven to ten minutes
and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and let it cool you put really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes french vanilla custard
that is really interesting are you saying to use for chocolate unsweetened a chocolate powder
unsweetened? that cocoa the unsweetened it comes in a real dark can
our mothers used to use it and then
I have some we all used to
I just want to it's the unsweetened kind it's not like nestles quik
I suppose you could use that
cooking chocolate but
that's really interesting I've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat I used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell and it was red and I'm this is kind of groedy
how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own? actually I found it in one of my mother's homemade cookbooks something she had collected out of woman's day or something is that right?
that is just really neat because I I think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or a regular beater but
it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good but I still think a beater would do it good enough the trick is to get the cornstarch
right in the lukewarm milk sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and I would put it in the sink and I'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good it seems to be better than putting the cornstarch into the liquid once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
so you put the milk in the cornstarch? and I'll do this sometimes I'll put my after I pour that back into my saucepan I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg so
and then put that back in the saucepan? and then if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more
that's because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the cocoa is my husband really likes it thick he says I can stick the spoon right in this
because I'm always worrying it won't firm up because when you take it out of the saucepan it's I hope this thickens a little more because it's not real package thick when you cook a package it's a little less
but I put it in a nice glass bowl and some people don't like that film on the pudding so you can put saran wrap over the top
and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap so when you pull the saran wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap and I might put it back on but
do you put it in the refrigerator then or when it starts steaming a lot I definitely put it in the refrigerator
but I my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard
that's true I knew that that's
that's why I do that
I don't know that's my great hard recipe are you a player?
I think I am it's been a while now has it?
I've just recently I got married and we bought a house we're about fifty yards from the golf course
but unfortunately the house is taking up my time
so it's been almost a year since I've actually swung a club for a purpose I haven't played in about two years and then I went out two weeks ago with the guys here I work at t I
and I played in a tournament out there and I shot a net fifty nine they were kind of little upset I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits
I have a hard time inventing shots let's go around this tree and try a slice through a hook here
and I can't do that so
I finally got out and I've been watching quite a few videos I had not been able to play so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while and I hope I'm on the right track
shot a career low eighty nine and my handicap is twenty nine
that's great I like that
now like I say it's been a while for me too I've got my wife motivated about it
and I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments is get her a set of clubs and we'll get out of the driving range and get some interest built up and hopefully we can start in I've tried to get my wife I bought her a set of clubs four years ago she hasn't even swung them but she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day
she's ready to get off into it
that's good but I just like getting out being in the outdoors and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway but
same thing here at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really
and I walk I don't ride so
I get a little exercise there too so
that's I've got the same attitude I tell you I started I guess the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when I was in college
and I took it as a p e course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got into it while I was still in school
and since then we've made it as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of having a thursday have probably a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding
so it that's back in south dakota where I grew up
so that's been my main involvement is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here but eventually I get people to come and visit me in dallas
and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home it's pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed
here it is sixty five degrees we're out playing golf and they're freezing cold back there but actually I picked it up when I was in high school on the same as a p e course
when I got into the service I got into it
and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go and then one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf and I said I've got my clubs but I haven't swung them in quite a few years
and then I got into it and then back out of it and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there
that's right I really enjoy it it's really nice
it is it's a lot of fun especially if you can find somebody that's got the same level of interest that seem to be the hardest thing
about that's true of any sport if you want to play tennis or racquetball you don't want to go out and get beat to death but
and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time
and and then we've got some guys here that they are four and five handicappers
and they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time
that's right and I've never yet have I walked up now I've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome that's true they are always friendly
that's true come on out and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying let me tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
it's pretty nice and friendly out there
that's so and you can't find that in all sports
that's absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you get in a rut if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you aren't going to learn anything
after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then you've basically tapped your resources there you need to
but eventually I'd like to work up and maybe get involved in a mixed doubles league or something like that we have one down here in the summertime it runs from five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten
and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed league in and that's what I'm trying to get her ready for it's going to start when we change time back whenever that is next month
and it will start then and we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and they were shooting a hundred hundred and twenty
but they were now they're down into the hundreds nineties
so it won't take her long
that's good that's good that's sounds like a lot of fun
and it's something we can do together so she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that
she's does a little fishing but golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so
it sounds like we've got real similar situations
I've gone home every year now since I've moved to dallas to go pheasant hunting and the last time I took my wife along
and kind of the same situation she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but she'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along
but it's interesting
and it's a game that you don't bowling you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you don't have to be an expert to play that's right any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right
so you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all
that's right I've kind of formed the attitude that if I could pick two or three shots out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then I do pretty good
and I keep rationalizing that I can do it I just got to do it all on the same hole and then it will get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing
it really works that way and when I first got back into it I used to get mad because I knew I could do something and I didn't get it done
and I need to slice this ball around here I naturally slice anyway now the ball will go straight and I go
I never broke a club or anything but I'd get upset about it sometimes
and now I guess being in my forties I just kind of mellowed out a little bit
I don't get upset any more and
and that's great I've enjoyed talking to you
you bet I guess I'll go back to work
sounds like it see you later
just to let you know I have two children of my own I've got two boys one four year old and one two years old so I'm just starting out
I have two boys who are twenty eight and twenty four and a daughter who is twelve
that's quite a spread
same husband everything that's great
but one of the things that I like to do with my boys when I get home is I like to try and spend a lot of time with them they're not very old so they couldn't do a whole lot yet
but they like to spend time with me we just do various things nothing really they like to be outside as much as possible if it's not raining
but the weather's trying to turn now so
are you down here in texas? I'm in dallas
you know what I meant with rain
what what one of the trends I've noticed is that it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the t v and let them watch movies or play video games or something
I have can you hold on just a
I have to answer a business phone I hate to do it on this call that's okay
a r e this is arlene lister it was just a recorded message on our business phone anyway
I'm sorry keep going it's okay so that was the thing that I noticed that I know a lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the t v and let them be entertained that way
and seeing as you've got some older children I'm wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up?
there was not nearly as much of it in fact I think things were quite a bit different
when my big kids were little all the mothers were home
the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around and then when they felt like it they went out to play when they were little like that
and I think it's gotten very different when my second one was little they were coming out with sesame street which he started watching
and other than that there was not educational t v or you got some cartoons
and that was it but they were never that interested in it anyway they'd take their trucks out in the backyard go out and play and stuff
but we always did just to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum
we did a lot of stuff like that with our kids
and course when they got bigger they were both quite into sports and so whatever they would do we'd go along with
and a girl is very different
we have a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping
so they're very very different but kind of the same thing our she now lot of time spent with her is going to
last night was a band concert
and she plays on her school volleyball team and stuff like that but we still like to pack up just go someplace for the day or just stuff like that
one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station that's nice
that's we go down there fairly often for a weekend for family get togethers and stuff like that that's great
that's great I know I'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things and I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older
but for right now they don't just getting out in the front and just being outside is good for them because they like just being outside
I think our kids just always dearly loved that play bounce the ball or just
course when our big ones were little we lived up north
and this time of the year the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves
so it's very different that's true you don't see many leaves around dallas
and come winter time we'd stick them on sleds and we had a pond across the street
and from little on I'm it's so different down here where you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something
when our kids were little you got them a pair of skates
arlington texas since I got somebody from arlington virginia one day is that right?
I never thought about that but there is an arlington I had a call the other day from birmingham michigan
and I was thinking birmingham
the only birmingham I could think of was alabama it's funny how many names have been used all over the country
tell me what kind of books have you read? to tell you the truth I've been going to college for the last four years so mainly text books
I was going to say not fun kind? but I really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones
but sometimes I just read one about grace kelley I love to read about real people to me half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories
it is because it's really and truly a true thing it happened
I read one about bob hope that I liked
that was real good I'm like you if it's not a heavy biography I enjoy it
I used to like to read about royalty a lot when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived in europe that was my thing for a while
I was trying to think I read a novel that used the names of princess di and prince phillip coming over here to be entertained and all and there was a murder
it was some time ago seems like it was the spy went dancing or something like that it sounds like fun
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names wonder if it was by one of those famous writers margaret truman daniels writes a lot those
in fact I believe it was because
I believe sounds like something she would write
I think it was by her now that you mention it because someone had given it to me and I thought this will be great and it was I've heard that her books are really interesting and they always sell well and
when you use real people like that brings it to life
I know some of the british people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty
but that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth I know our movie stars
our movie stars because it's totally different concept to us
I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either I have read mostly novels I went to visit my daughter in florida
and I took a novel with me and read it at thanksgiving time and it was one of those generation novels
starts out when they're small and continues through generations I always like those and I like that have you ever read anything by susan howatch?
I have isn't she fabulous?
she is wonderful once you I don't like to get one of her books because I just live to read
I'll skip everything just to get back to the book
I stayed up one night until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I could not put it down
she's just a I don't know how often does she come out with them I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school
it seems like she doesn't write as often as danielle steele and those silly things she writes the same thing she can turn them out overnight I swear
and they're the same silly things if you've read one it's practically the same thing over and over I've never read a whole one of hers I don't think and think how rich she is
wouldn't I I'm criticizing her and wouldn't I like to have her money because they go from hardback to paperback and she has millions of them and then make movies out of some of them
mini series and so forth and it seems to me like susan howatch does not write as often I have not seen as many of hers hers are so involved and they're such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot
I think she does a lot of research too I do too she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers
but her books are just incredible I don't think they've ever made a movie do you?
I don't think so and I've often wondered why haven't you?
I I really just thought about it now but there's just
maybe it's because they take so much in I don't know
maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them they're so big
they're such it would be like another gone with the wind I guess another three hour movie
and maybe that turns people off but look at gone with the wind I know it's about one of my favorite movies
have you gotten into scarlett yet? it had such a bad press I wasn't too
that's exactly what I was going to say I was amazed because I in the beginning when it was on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad
and then when it came out all I heard was just how bad it was that I didn't even want to get it me either do you know anyone that's read it?
I haven't heard of anybody that's read it either
I think it was on the best seller list though for a while
it wouldn't surprise me
I was just trying to think about how I dress for work t I is a very casual atmosphere
and what I usually do on the weekend is lay out five outfits and on monday I wear the worst looking one because it doesn't seem like people are that alive on monday so
and then progressively through the week I'll wear nicer looking things and then on friday most everybody wears jeans and sweatshirts or jeans and blouses or something like that but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or skirts and pullover sweaters or little two piece dress suits but
that's a good way to approach it I've never thought about I do plan my clothes a week in advance actually I plan them a month in advance I usually do a month at a time so I don't repeat an outfit
but I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on monday because really no one's paying attention but I don't work outside of school I work in the computer lab at school so I can just wear whatever I have on for school and really it's I try to dress presentable but very comfortable
in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or pants I usually college is so casual you really don't want to dress up unless you have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that so where I work it's pretty casual I guess it's more like a college campus also there's hundreds of people work for t I
and a lot of people just wear jeans and sweats all the time and they dress up when customers are coming in or when we have department meetings or something like that
and a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for the real higher ups like the t I lawyers and those that work for the higher executives those secretaries they really dress up all the time
so there's a good combination in the hallways all the time
that's good that they're so casual
my brother works for t I and he's a computer engineer
and whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear a tie or a dress shirt everyday but he goes to work in his blue jeans t shirt and tennis shoes and he just loves it and that's very acceptable at t I
I believe at I b m they make you wear a blue suit and some kind of colored shirt and a tie
that's what I've heard I would hate to be in that atmosphere
but they just moved into the new building he calls it the new building I don't know it's where all the executives are
and so they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans but he just left for italy today at four and he'll be over there until july first setting up some kind of computers for them I see
for t I but over in italy t I is everywhere
he was so excited about going
but he didn't carry any ties or anything because he just went over there with that attitude if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it that's true that's a good idea
because he didn't he's not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but his preference is blue jeans and a t shirt so
but I think that's great about t I and also to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the different designated areas for smokers and stuff the
I think that's great and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke area and you don't smoke you almost strangle
do you smoke? so much smoke in the air the smoking area it's closed in
and if you don't smoke and you go in there everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when you go in there I used to smoke a long time ago
I think that's I used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes that's one of the reason that I stopped
you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and? she always had to have a lot of clothes
that's how I am but my mamma was not raised like that and so I wasn't either my daughter she's real good at finding sales though
me to I have to hunt them down she'll buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons and just have them for the next year
and she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and buys clothes when they were coming up I didn't sew but now I've learned how to sew so I'm still learning how and I'm getting much better at it and I'm going to be able to make my own clothes that's great
I wanted to take a sewing class at school but I just haven't fit it into my schedule yet but that can really benefit
that's something that I'd be very interested in learning because clothes are really expensive
they're outrageous a little simple shell blouse that you can make for about ten dollars at the most out of a decent fabric runs you twenty something dollars in the store
it's marked up just a little shell to go under a suit
it is really outrageous but whenever I was growing up and all my mom I never understood this then but I do now but she never would buy me the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that
and she always told me it was because I was still growing and she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week especially to pay that kind of money for it
I have a friend who she had a little boy and she used to dress him out of neiman marcus she dressed him fabulously
and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff
and she finally learned that you just can not do this so now she finds the basement sales just like everybody else
that's the best way to shop I always thought my mom was being mean to me but I look back at it now and my child is going to I'm going to raise mine the same way
I don't know they're just so outrageously priced it's just incredible and you
I try to always catch the sales
always and and you just have to keep buying them if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the quality is really not that great for the price that you pay
it depends on there's always a reason why they're on sale
so that has a lot to do with it
but I bought the most beautiful sweater from ross dress for less
and it was really pretty it was just a plain round necked sweater
and it was embellished around the top it had leather designs and some other little things on it and I just thought it was so pretty and I got it at a real good price I think maybe it was nine ninety nine or something
that's great and it was so pretty and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why it was so cheap
in the middle of the back of it there was it's like there it had been slit and they had just sewed it back together right in the middle of the back
wasn't a seam or anything
and that's why it was so cheap although it's not really noticeable from the outside but still it's really not a good quality
and then I was told by somebody that works for j c penney's that ross is just one of those places that sells seconds
the defect they don't really buy the first quality they buy the second and places like j c penney's they'll reject the seconds they'll send them back every time
but places like ross dress for less and t j max t j max does that
we have a t j max over here and
what do you think about the idea of having volunteer service for everyone?
I think that really it wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service and there have been so many people that have done it
and I've talked with several and I think they've gotten a lot out of it are you doing any kind of volunteer work now?
not right now but I have done red cross work and I've taught c p r training what about when would people do it when they finished high school?
I think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal because a lot of times if they go straight into college I think they're going in too quick but I think particular boys that the maturity in fact I wasn't very mature when I left high school and I think there's a real challenge there there's also this issue of whether you're really ready and I think it gives a different perspective
I think if you've been out of school a year year and a half before you start to college you appreciate college more than someone that just goes right straight into college
the only complication is how do you fund something like this?
a lot of parents fund their children there are some groups that have their children go away for a year even the religious organizations I think the mormon church sends out missionaries that
and the parents fund them for the whole year year and a half that they're gone it's interesting it gets them away from home and gets them to do something useful although the kids today though it seems almost that their concern for money we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious as to if if there was mandatory you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary do you think that would be reasonable?
I think it would in israel even the women are required to be in the military for a certain period of time I was in the military and I personally feel if they have the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men but the issue of which what would you have them do? there are a lot of people around with there's a lot of unemployment right now what would you have these people do if they were brought in?
what into the service?
or or say the volunteer say that it was mandatory
I think that they ought to have something for the unemployed in a voluntary field like the
I don't know if you remember about the w p a my father was in the c c c
he was in that? it's not the best thing in the world but it gave them something to do it seems that there's some things like the programs at least just go around and clean up streets and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things
or go into the more depressed areas and help repair the houses in fact we helped with help to help humanities and that was a good experience but you take the kids out and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that either need demolishing or need fixing up so
it would be a good idea we've been doing this three or four minutes I think that do you have any other further comments?
not really it was good talking to you betty
I'll talk to you later have a good night
have you seen a new movie lately?
I am a student and I have been actually watching more movies on video than being able to go out to see movies at the theater
I want to see the fisher king and catch robin hood I haven't seen either one of those what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?
let's see I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on white palace which I thought was over hyped recently you're catching me at mind's end here what have you seen recently? maybe you have seen dances with wolves
what did you think of that one? enjoyed that quite a bit
I thought the cinematography was excellent
the story was though it tended to be a little one sided it was good
it was believable I just moved down in fact from south dakota in june and that's when the movie was filmed
and when the movie came out we went my dad lives in the state capital which is pierre
and it was filmed right outside of pierre in fact the big buffalo herd scene that was a live scene
there's a guy that has got a buffalo farm and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and my dad has got a little plane we flew over it all looked at the buffalo it was really neat so we are watching the movie in the movie theater in pierre
and just every time I would start to get into the movie and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell there's john red eagle
or they'd start recognizing people
they knew the extras or the I think I enjoyed it more when I watched it on video cassette than I did in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that I'd go which one could that be
and I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of picking up the overall scope
but I thought it was a good film but you are right I think it was very one sided
it was but it's a side that hasn't been told as far as telling it from the indians as the good guys and the white men as the bad guys I really thought about all the westerns that we have seen for years and years
and it's just shoot the indians and they are always the savages
in fact I was watching wild wild west last night and it was a similar situation with the iroquois indians attacking an army fort
but it was an interesting movie have you seen pretty woman?
I thought that was a good show
that was a good movie it was just kind of a get away movie
kind of it didn't have any real social bearing and it wasn't really a comedy
but it was an enjoyable movie it was kind of like the star wars series just something a little different yet believable
you're bringing it I don't know I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen but I've seen pretty woman and dances with wolves and are you much of a star trek fan are you going to see this next one that's coming out?
have you seen the rest?
I think I've missed one I'm not sure but I think I've missed one I actually went to the star trek twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago and they showed all five in a row was that here in dallas?
they had it everywhere every major city had one theater that did it and because we had one here in dallas
and they did it in houston they did it everywhere and it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row time wise they happen one after another and just no time between them but you can watch the characters develop
my name is nola I'm in plano texas I'm steve I'm in dallas texas
not too far away that's unusual seems like usually
I've had some from plano too I think all mine have been east coast people so far
let's see social changes social changes what's that mean?
that sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties
think we can handle that?
I definitely there's plenty of things to talk about there that's a
shall I go ahead and push one?
you want to go ahead and start? I was hoping that you would but
in social changes is that it seems to me that that involves a lot of different areas I think does that
a lot it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today?
there is a big difference in the economic status of people although I think that has been true always
perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was it's like people are starting to give up hope and they start out very poor let's see that's a bad tangent to get on what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties?
I think in my situation I have three children and we're home schooling so things that relate to education are things that I think about a lot I think that involves social changes a lot for instance I think the schools are having more and more problems because of things that are happening socially in the world around them and because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather and children being put in day care centers from very early and I think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn
and they don't have the self esteem that they need to have and they don't have a solid family life that they need to have to confidently deal with the things in the world and I think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang things that are happening and it seems so that that is a pretty big change it seems even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like some of these even ladies that'll work and have a baby and then after two or three months go back to work
it's that's very young for a baby
that's really sad I think that a lot of people and they think they have to but
I think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and I think that if they didn't and it became more of the standard not to that maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home and have a more solid foundation for the kids
they're going to like you said they might be saving money even if they had to pay more now in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short term that's right
it already costs society much more because of it
it trying to do all these programs like headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them
there's and I think a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that
there are a lot of two parent situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment rather than that she has to have the money particularly
or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too it
it's interesting home study is that what you said? home school home school
is it a preschool level then or through grade school or
I have one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way I
you sound busy so you're teaching them completely
and I think it's becoming more popular then it has been for a while home schooling's always been around but I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools and a lot of it is discipline problems
a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things that they've been raised in a day care center
that's pretty sad because something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway
I think it's going to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else when they're young
the home is the base it's the basic unit and that's where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better
and educating changing people's expectations
I know they do have some classes in high schools and things for kids to give them an idea of what family life is like and that kind of thing but
could you tell me what you think contributes most to air pollution?
it's hard to say while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories pollute a lot if you look at how much pollution is kicked up by an active volcano it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all what do you think? you talked about volcanos I'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and what the amount of material that they do put into the atmosphere I think probably the greatest cause is vehicles especially around cities
do you live right in the city itself?
I'm more out in the suburbs but I certainly work near a city so can you notice
how about you? it's I live in a rural area
it's mainly farms and no heavy industry attleboro itself I live in rhode island
I see and it's in the north I live up in the northeast corner and attleboro sits just over the line where t I's plant is
but there isn't a lot of heavy industry there's the freeways and we get an occasional it depends which way the wind's blowing from boston cause we're forty miles south of boston so we'll pick up that and I've noticed over the past maybe five or six years we live about twenty miles away from the state airport and I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes
and it seems like we're catching all that residue I'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping but other than that we don't have the emissions from the power plants
you mean from the coal we generate one of our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to generate electricity
there doesn't seem to be much emission from them but I'm not sure about the rest of the country
I notice locally a major problem is kodak it's interesting because in order to keep with the e p a standards which tend to be what's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night so people get up is that right?
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood and they've got this black ash on their cars which seems to be
I really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and there must be some of the larger plants up around one hundred twenty eight
we've got reports that during the night seems like they'd blow off their stacks from the warehouses for powerhouses
and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and spots all over them
so you're right they could do something about that I guess
that seems a little ridiculous how are your lakes and
they've been getting cleaner they have?
but I'm not sure how much the water pollution is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain acid rain that's what I was
the stuff I've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all I'm not an expert didn't they just have an article on they were dumping lime
up here? upstate new york somewhere over huge areas I haven't read that
and they thought that was more beneficial because some of it does soak in and some of it runs off right away in to the streams and rivers and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
I can't remember where I read that recently somewhere and I can't remember where
that's but I thought it was up there so that's interesting because new hampshire and parts of vermont they showed pictures of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain
you kind of think it's something else then?
that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article so that they didn't say what though they just said they thought it was
they didn't say what they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected that it may be other natural things at work natural disease
so it's less than clear like I said I don't remember the article that well
but I don't know what do you think we can as individuals or as a group do about air pollution? we can demand more efficient automobiles for one thing I still think that's one of our major causes of pollutants
how we go about that it's a little bit difficult
I think it's up to individuals too to ask automakers for less pollutant vehicles
I think you need a vehicle something like nader's raiders or a a r p which has a lot of members if you can get those types of groups
do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem I remember reading an article that said it's the older polluters the twelve and fifteen year old cars contribute ninety percent of the automobile pollution
and the new cars is hardly anything they're better but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch smoke or
but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune I'm not really sure you think that the trucking industry is that incompetent that they wouldn't fuel is one of their biggest costs so you would
but diesel engines diesel engines
it they do generate a lot of soot but at least that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly we could also push for legislation for rapid transit systems this country seems to be a little behind on that
on the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient but only because we got used to single person single car driving
a lot of people don't even like to carpool
but we could that that'll help air pollution
the united states and canada is going into some types of agreements to limit what's being given out by power plants
I guess canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there so that's helping
what do you think about a device a meter right on a tail pipe and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted? that's an idea don't say that too loud though because every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating revenue
it just means if you don't pollute or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it maybe you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe and the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe and you couldn't start your car anymore that's an interesting concept is that your idea?
but it's I guess the difficulty would be that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something I was going to say it could be installed like a catalytic converter
I guess you could take those off too but
you could take but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off if you can take a muffler off and only replace not unless it was built into every muffler and that's
but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that busses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
that's quite a concept you should pursue that or patent it
patent it that's a good idea if you could come up with a device that's the thing
but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that but that's a thought
you're right and that will solve a lot of problems I don't know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
but a proposal to the proper authorities
you might generate some interest in it
the automobile regulatory agencies or something but that's a good idea other than that I'm not sure what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization what vacations have you been on that you like?
I really enjoyed I went to mackinaw island a few years back
it's in the middle of michigan and so that was nice
I like driving to different cities because of the scenery so that was nice so you most of yours is kind of driving and
I've been all over the states except for pretty much east it's very pretty driving up north in wisconsin too how far do you usually end up driving
the furthest I drove was probably texas and then I've taken a train before to california you're from where? wisconsin kenosha wisconsin
I have a brother in minnesota that used to live in wisconsin
so that's quite a ways
it is I've we went to california this last year and liked it
but it was too crowded
walt disney world and other places it's just the wrong time of the year to go
and course you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's outrageously priced
and kind of you wonder if it's really worth it to pay thirty five dollars or forty dollars just to get in
but there's lots of fun places to see that's true I think the scenery kind of that's something do to you like to get up in mountains or
do you have any mountains nearby?
pretty flat isn't it?
I think the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it
what vacation have you enjoyed the most?
probably when we go to wisconsin it's pretty fun there's a lot to do up there it's pretty busy though you have to like crowds what is it?
it's a huge amusement park they have water slides
and it's just a big big tourist attraction the downtown is all little shops and candy shops and it's really neat I don't think hardly anybody lives there because it's just kind of tourists probably a city in itself kind of?
it's mostly a summer place summer place how far away is it?
from kenosha it's about three hours
it's about a hour away from madison so that's nice
it's a pretty ride up there too I really like the city wausau in wisconsin it's really pretty it's nice out there I like all the nature things there are to look at and you can probably you're in a climate that's kind of humid so you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things our climate's real dry
where is that? and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery most of the land's pretty brown you don't have as much of the greenery like you have
where's that? idaho is where I live and
it's by I have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that I'm on the phone
it's by boise you ever heard of boise?
and it's fine it's nice it's uh lot different kind of I lived in indiana for a while and it's a real different land and scenery than there it's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that
I think there's a lot of places down even in southern utah the canyon lands and bryce canyon and they're gorgeous
those are kind of fun places we usually go over to bear lake in the summer which is kind of on the border of idaho and utah and the lake goes on forever and that's real pretty over there too
but I think I'm kind of a summer vacationer
me too me too unless I'm going somewhere warm for the winter
that'd be nice where'd you
so what was the last car repair you had?
just recently I was kind of laughing when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because I had to have my radiator flushed
and it was getting rusty and the thing that they forgot to do was to also look at the hose and I had gone about two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst so I was stranded out on the highway did you crack the block or what?
I didn't do that but there seemed to be enough antifreeze left to do that but it cost me all kind of money to have that repaired after they said they had repaired it so that was a horrible experience just recently I see you got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though
that can be pretty serious
I know I know what about you? I guess it's been awhile for me I'd it's been about a year
I had the water pump break on my car
I was traveling I was going on my way home from thanksgiving
and it broke in the middle of nowhere
so I had to get it towed and then fixed and big pain
I know I know especially when you're out on the highway that's where I was luckily someone came by and gave me a ride
I know living in dallas we've got bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and that was horrible
to have the your car is fuming and everything it's already a hundred degrees you don't need that too
but my car is getting old it's about six years old now so so is mine
so I got it right out of college and so it's starting to show the wear and tear now I'm hoping mine gets me through I got until may until I'm out so when I cross that one I'll be okay
that was my graduation present to myself so that's nice
I know but it's really starting to wear so I've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car
because I don't know if I want to pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is and it's not worth it
that's true I agree with you there
so I don't know because I need to have it tuned up and replace some of the belts and I was looking at the tires need to be replaced and so I was thinking just a lot of money I'm might as well buy me a new car for that I got new tires last winter too so I'm that's the last major purchase for this thing it's not worth it
you have to in pennsylvania you have to really have your car winterized and stuff
we get some killer winters up here in the mountains
so lot of snow and a lot of cold
especially don't you have a lot of salt on the ground? at times there's a lot of it
you got to clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
rust and the body too I haven't had a big problem with that though
so I've been pretty lucky there
I think they get the new z bart stuff and everything to where you can that's usually pretty good you just rinse it off after the winter is over and done with it
and go like that so I usually like to do most repairs on my own though
do you? just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't
plus if something goes wrong I know who to blame
I think I'm getting too old for all that I had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff so I can do all that stuff but I think I'd much prefer to pay the twenty two ninety five to go have it done now so I can get my hands dirty
so I'm just getting to that age I guess you just don't have your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore more fun things to do so
I'm trying to I just need one I had two cars there for a while so I wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run that's nice
and but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them
and so that one is bad enough
one was bad enough but I think I got rid of the wrong one
I need a lot of repairs done on this one so
that was something else are our five minutes up? I was just wondering that
I didn't set the time or anything to I didn't either
put this must be a hard category
I guess unless you're big do it yourselfer to fix up your own cars and things like that but I guess they were talking about experiences I did my parents live in ohio so I do know something about the really cold weather and I've always lived down here in the south and I took my car up there to their house and I guess I had a crack in the block and when I got up there the car
I think the first thing they said I have written this down so it would do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government?
you're asking what my opinion about whether it's possible to have honesty in government
I suspect that it is possible I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody that's a good point
but other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty that's interesting I had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago it said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers and I thought that was interesting it wasn't just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past on and
so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for because they want to be a service to us or are they in there for their own gains and personally I feel there's probably some of each
but I think maybe a lot of them the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while I'm in office
and how good a name can I make for myself and so forth so I guess it would be like anything else
the president of general motors probably has the same
and they talked the other let's see third question was how serving for their own gains do you think goes on then they that's hard to but I agree with you there's a lot in business I think that's very normal that we should not
I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be more to the point I think we put too much on politicians we expect them to only be there to serve us
if you knew what you were getting when you voted that's a problem isn't it?
it's interesting because I'm taking a texas government class right now and one of the things it's so easy to blame them to a lot of times I think it's our own fault they lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth
they say you get the government you deserve and it
if they tell us the truth we don't elect them especially with all this stuff coming up here lately about people's past
and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore
it's hard to imagine because it's gotten just
we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at
and it almost seems like in order to avoid some of the scandal you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find in the bobsy twins or something like that
I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out I don't think there would be too many left
you're taking a government course?
at what? the university? it's t c j c tarrant county junior college
and it's really enjoyable I like it and then they also ask do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
you can make laws against corruption but that doesn't mean
but that doesn't eliminate it does it? I don't think making laws will stop it I don't know how many laws you would have to have I mean
they've got laws against cannibalism but that didn't stop that guy in milwaukee did it? sure didn't did it?
so I think you can legislate but I think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating and we would end up with so many more laws that I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government in business personal life
actually I think other countries may have it worse the japanese government is always having some kind of a scandal
usually involving the prime minister or people very close to him
so I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes but when I think about where I'd want to go this is still the best or I can
I've been around to a few other countries and I have not found one yet that I would rather live in I think at its worst I think we've got the best
is kind of fun it's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now and I grew up in an area that was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal I worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats speedboats you name it they had it and we did a lot of water sports but I think the thing I liked the best was we spent about a summer couple of guys restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it upright again this one you had to work with you get out of the water again and get it upright and sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind as it were tacking back and forth and more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over it was calm so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away and that didn't always work we oftentimes got wet but it's a nice hobby to have nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore things change I guess what are your memories of boating or current
about the only memories that I have of boating my husband's family had a motor boat when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times and I really did enjoy that I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything but we did some water skiing of course and driving around the lake in the boat and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the laws were there and if you didn't obey them there were a lot of accidents that's true
but I found the motor boating was real fun I remember learning how to ski I guess I was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres and it had a lot of turtles in it and I got all ready to go and I was down in the water and set to go and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back
it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where I let go and the boat went off without me and I reached back there and pushed him away and got out of the water a while and it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and so I told everybody what happened and they go
and so I get back down in there and I'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier I had let go before then and before they took off this time and swatted him away so I moved over a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and managed to get up didn't go very far but I got up and it was a nice long skiing career but now I've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me I've done about all I dare do on skis skiing on one and jumping around here and there and I know how you can get injured doing much more than that and I just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just can't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager I guess life just changes a little bit in that respect I'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that doesn't have a what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards I haven't managed to get a hold on that craft yet but
that sounds like a real challenge it would be kind of nice I hadn't quite figured out I don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what I've seen you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around
but I don't know maybe someday I'll get back to that after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end weekend or something my son so what movies have you seen lately?
lately I've seen soap dish
which was a and that was a lot of fun it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things that's something I want to see
that's on my list to see
it was okay it was not a wonderful film but it was cute but not the biggest laugh I've seen
I saw thelma and louise a couple of days ago and really liked that did you?
actually I saw it twice because I liked it so much that's also on my list
and it's really disturbing but a good movie a disturbing movie how do you mean?
it was let's see the it's different it's an shoot'em up kind of film
but it's with women in it instead of men so that's kind of a twist on the normal thing a switcheroo
and it made me think a lot about you would applaud bruce willis in die hard if he was doing this but you might not be so encouraging of susan sarandon and then gena davis when they do it when the shoe is on the other foot and see how it
so that was kind of interesting I've but I really enjoyed it
so I because that just reminds me of back in school and the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble
that's kind of what it was but they had started out with that then they got into lots of trouble before we found the shopping malls that's what we did
I'll have to keep that on my list then
I also saw that madonna movie it's truth or dare and that was pretty scandalous scandalous?
it was kind of madonna she's pretty trashy I can imagine
and so it was interesting I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is
I think she kept saying that they talked about her it was a film of her concert tour she had taken all around the world and they were all to her at the vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in rome and she kept saying that her show was not garbage it had a social message to it and you just had to find it you had to wade through it and find it
we never quite believed that so you never quite got to I thought that was pushing it a little bit but she all I know about that woman is that she's an incredible marketeer
she is she's rich and she's rich and she so
she's smart at what she does she knows how to do that she knows how to twist this around
what did you think about dances with wolves when you saw it? we're getting back to last year that's probably the last movie I saw dances with wolves I just adored it
how can I tell you maybe ten years ago I had read bury my heart at wounded knee and so just the general theme of the whole movie was pretty
I really liked it a lot
it was a real consciousness raiser I guess and I only bring up wounded knee because that was what ten years ago you read and understood about the indian population
and then everything went away for a couple years
and now it's back again and it's sort of a popular view of what happened way back then
of course no one will ever know really I don't
I know I was I wondered if the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the evil tribe if they were really as bad as it made them to be who knows it sort of showed two different types of tribes one was a warring tribe and the other one was uh vegetarian kind of feel good tribe sort of thing
so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world
nobody can get along peacefully
but I wonder I thought because they made a big deal about how this film was such a big leap for the people who were the ancestors of this indian tribe and that was so wonderful that they done that and I wonder if they were offended by the film I see
if it you didn't hear any press about that
I thought it was a very interesting movie I think so I have come to respect a little bit more what went on here
but who knows how it's supposed to all end
on the broad scope it had a much bigger meaning to me about just the meaning of the freedom of this country and what that really meant
and that was taking over somebody else's freedoms and sort of trampling that
so it meant something bigger I think but still it was a I loved the buffalo scene and I thought kevin costner was just I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every three minutes
I know the but he's the director but I just thought it was a really interesting intense film
that's good intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast
it was good I looked at my watch only a few times which is a good thing ate a lot of popcorn
but it put me in a really bad mood I don't know why did it really?
we there were three of us who went we were just all really grouchy when it was over so we decided that may be the mark of a good film it made us think and so it made you think
we were grouchy we felt guilty for being maybe that was
but there are no answers
I know and we had nothing to do with it that can make you crabby we were not responsible
but we still felt the thick blame for what had gone on that's true
we could have but it's they sort of candy coated the western story for many years
and when the truth it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story but
have you seen any other movies? because you sound like you see a lot
I do I'm just out of school so I've seen a lot of
don't have a job so I shouldn't go see movies all the time there you go
I rented a good movie called cinema paradeso which is an italian movie which is probably the best movie I've seen ever
it was just wonderful
it's uh story about a little boy in a little italian village and he owns a or he works in a movie theater and it helps the projectionist there's an old man who's the projectionist and he befriends this old man and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years
and it's just if you don't mind reading subtitles I thought I had to kind of get beyond that
those little reading the little words at the bottom of the screen but I just laughed and cried and I really loved it I'll have to write that down
that was a great one
and other than that I I'll have to write that did you see texasville? are you into larry mcmurtry? I hadn't
I had read the last picture show but that's out on video now and I haven't seen it but I was interested in reading texasville before I saw the movie
did you like it? I read a lot of larry mcmurtry books
and texasville is just like that it's very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do with each other
it's and it's just sort of a
what kind of hobbies do you have lori?
I guess I like to play golf
and I also like to plant flowers and do some gardening and do arts and crafts where do you play golf in this area?
we live pretty close to the mesquite golf course
we will play either out there or at firewheel that is usually where we play but I have played different courses in the dallas area do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf? both not at the same time I was going to say that could be difficult
sometimes we ride and sometimes we pull we like to a lot of the times just walk for the exercise but I find that when I ride in a cart I play better and I think it is cause I don't get as tired I think that might be true
I don't like pulling a cart on firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path I know and that makes me so mad
it is not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently that is the reason I don't play over there
I like the course but I don't play over there because they don't allow you to pull a cart
and I don't think a cart damages the turf
the reason why we play over there is because since we are a garland resident they gave us a special deal where you can get ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are
so that is why we play over there cause we have got our card I guess I could use a card too I live very close to the firewheel golf course
do you? so you live in garland then I live in northwest garland right up there near the golf course
we are in south garland but next time you go check into it they have it is just like a bus card and they just punch it it has got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you in the last two years I have not played very much golf because I am involved in boy scouts
so I have children boy scout age
you must have a son I have two boys that are boy scout age and so I am very active in boy scouts
so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby but I
that sounds like fun too but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college
you need to teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you that's right lessons are expensive though
you can teach them they would probably never make it then because I don't think I only took lessons for golf when I was in college
as a course for p e so I could graduate
but that is the only time I think I have ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual
I took one lesson one other time besides that I just try to make the club hit the ball
I know what you mean I don't want to play strike out
but I have fun doing it I have some good shots and some bad shots
it is just nice to get outdoors and do something so you said you work in the gardens too do you have special flowers?
flower gardens I like to have matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs so those ought to be coming up around spring time my wife had just put in a bunch of pansies
she put them in two months ago cause they are winter plants
and they have been we thought even with all the cold weather we have had they have been blooming just fine
they do great I put mine in probably in november that is when she did I think
I think it was november and I don't do anything to mine water them or anything and they just they do really good and last year or the year before I had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later I didn't do anything to them so they are good to plant in the winter time they last for a long time then so you can put them out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time? will they make it through the summer sun?
they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot but they make it through probably winter and spring so
I have got some of those too cause I love flowers that is good
and I try to do some arts and crafts and I love to go does your family normally have a reunion? do you have one that's been
on my father's side we've really there
on my mother's side we've had several it's not really on a regular basis
but usually sometimes every few summers all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about
so they're pretty much just reunited always
so it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together it might be a good time for you to start a tradition I know that's you could be responsible for that yourself do that that's true
how about your family? in my family last october was the forty fifth annual reunion
you're a pro at this the first sunday in october the jordan family gets together
that's good and all of the descendants of the civil war veterans come together and they come as far away from california and there's usually between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people
and then where do you meet? there's a big community hall in vernon texas
and that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the texas family
do you have relatives in vernon then?
a lot of the older family lives in vernon
all of his direct descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties
so we're talking about second and third great children here
I took them up until this year they're grown and gone from home now
so they take their family
but let's see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather so it would be the second great grandchild and so they
so this town hall that you meet in is that like a it's a community hall it's a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in
and you just bring the covered dishes every family brings a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years
potato salad and we try to stay away from those things which might have salmonella in them
that's good and we choose to bring congealed salad you can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad
and most of us are very conscious of sanitation aspects whatever you've got to carry for any distance
I always take home baked bread
that's nice that happens to be my specialty for that family I do other things very well
but there are others in the family who do them better
do they always have the one person in the family who everyone thinks they know how to make this the best so that's what they get to cook
that's good I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so I learned a lot about them I haven't been to a lot
but we talked a lot about the rituals
you all equated the family reunions as with the protestant
it was the protestant version of the catholic pilgrimage
it was an interesting theory she talked about the catholics it's all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all you don't have to come home so the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe but when the protestant ethic happened in america there were people who ever went out and went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home for their reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage
but she had it was interesting I don't know how valid it is but she talked about that and how the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and about the bread and the ritual placement do you have a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every year? is there kind of a salads go first and things like that? it's we have kind of a core group that serves as quote officers of the organization
and they plan the reunions the organize who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles
that's pretty we have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and they're entered into a wonderful scrap book and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone and it keeps the family alive even though it's very fluid
sure does that's wonderful and they're very dedicated to that and it's been really wonderful it helps you hang onto your roots
I wish we'd and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family his family was very scattered and very diverse
and I got to talking to him I said how is his nephew doing I don't know I haven't talked to my brother in three years
I said how's your brother doing? I don't know my son keeps in touch with him but I don't
I said wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people? but I'm it's too much trouble so I got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at lake tawakoni you're just
that's incredible liked to kill me because I didn't have that group cooperation I did it by myself
and nobody brought covered dishes we had a great big fish fry and I fixed a salad in a number three tub
and it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping and we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and I told him
have you done this repetitively or just once? we did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there we sent invitations we said let us know if you're coming it was when his step father had died the year before
and it his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one he began to lose family members
that's we had a problem with that and it was difficult to hold them together and then of course he died two years ago so that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now
and it I think that's what happens when they get scattered the family unit falls into disrepair
that was our problem
the first major reunion was probably six or seven years ago
and then the second reunion people who maybe had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought it's not that big a thing this year
and so it kind of wound down
and then finally you get the shreveport relatives there but no one else so that those people who are at that core group manage to keep the vigor alive they'll send out news bulletins two or three times a year you'll get a news guess who got elected to the legislature or guess who our local sheriff you live in dallas?
I live in dallas I understand that the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
I think right now it's kind of bad I don't live in a house I live in an apartment are you in a house?
we have a single family home in northern virginia just outside of washington
I guess the best I can do is compare apartments
if it can compare the one that I have now with the one that I had the last time the one that I have now has a lot more amenities than the one that I moved out of
this one gave us free cable and ceiling fans and it was practically new when I moved in here and the carpet was new and do you live in the high rise?
it's not a high rise it's just a two story building
but there are a lot of buildings but it's just two stories on the second floor they don't have a patio but they have a sunroom instead of the patio on the first floor where I am there's a patio so you have one floor all to yourself?
the rooms are nice and large and let's see I have two bedrooms and that's nice do you get your own washer dryer?
I have a washer and dryer area and I did buy the washer and dryer but they didn't provide it
the one that I moved from didn't have a place to put them and that's one of the reasons that I did move that is nice
get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat
tell me I've always been pretty lucky the real estate out here's been pretty good the prices came down last year we had sort of a dallas syndrome
the past year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern virginia
it's a real good it just never happened before so it's really surprising everybody all the developers don't know what to do
it's a good time to buy if you're in the market
we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids
and we have a three bedroom house and it's pretty much filled up right now
so you want a bigger one get an extra bedroom or a basement right now it's just a single level rambler
one thing about the houses in dallas they don't utilize basements the way they did in new york
my parents in new york had a three family house actual a
two family house where the downstairs and the second floor they had and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment
and they had a basement
and they finished the basement and they were able to rent that out also but in dallas I just haven't seen basements in houses
and I've looked at a lot of them a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there and that's what he said was that it just wasn't something that people had down there
it's they put pools and garages on but no basements
I have yet to see a basement in a house
and maybe it's all the sand is there a lot of sand in I always think it's like a desert I don't know dallas always
I don't see that kind of sand here there are some areas though where they have a problem with the houses kind of sinking a little bit to the
or the foundation is sinking or something just a little bit some more than others but you have to know the right spot to pick where that doesn't happen
and out here we live in what used to be a prairie or whatever a natural grasslands
and they it's just you go down four inches and fourteen inches you get to sandstone
and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast I see it's just solid sandstone
where did you say you're at colorado? virginia
virginia virginia that's right it's sort of unusual really most of virginia is clay
anywhere near virginia beach? my folks used to live there back before I was born they lived there
different areas in dallas have different kind in texas I'll say because down in east texas there's a lot of red clay
and in the dallas fort worth city areas you don't see that texas is a big state so I imagine the type of houses and things like that are truly different from area to area
but that's the same way out here because for example we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds washington
and anything instead the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
so I could never afford a house inside the beltway that's why we came out here this is called the country with only maybe twenty miles total from d c twenty five from the city
but it's considered the country since it's that far out
but we live out by dulles airport
I see and that's one of the few places still in northern virginia they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here and it's still pretty rural
not too much of northern virginia is like that anymore land has gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like that
is your house in an area by itself? we're in a development
it's not connected to another one? there's there's another one a quarter acre away rather
but they're not connected are they? you have to stay in one single family home I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up
my folks had an apartment for a while when we were kids but for the most part they always had and pennsylvania always had a single family home and so as soon as we could we got a single family home
and that's all I ever knew growing up
so I stayed in a townhouse for two years and then saved up enough money to get a
my name is donna and I'm calling from plano texas
I'm jay in dallas I find exercise kind of a task I guess I'd say I go to aerobics two days a week but I also have three kids at home so they keep me pretty busy
that keeps you plenty of exercise that gives me plenty of exercise but I enjoy walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family excuse me that's fine and yourself
I have I walked and run almost every morning I've sort of stopped here with the weather change but it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning every morning my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing
that would that's fantastic exercise he does it every day like a ritual once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if someone invites him to lunch he'll not go but he goes every day and then he's a runner too he runs three mornings a week he gets up about five and does his deal
and some days he doesn't but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run and we
I'd rather get a bicycle but I had an exercise bike in the house but didn't seem to use it enough so somebody sold it in a garage sale but I'd like to get a bike and just do biking outside
the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here and I know my husband and I both do it to just keep the pounds off we're getting up in age in our late thirties so we need to keep exercising just to be able to
it keeps going because I'm fifty five and it just gets worse you still want to eat but you just I know
I think you feel better too if you get on some program like that but I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week and I take my three year old with me there's a nursery there and it's kind of another day out for her to have little friends
and I enjoy the socialization of it getting to see the same women every morning
but there are some parts during that exercise that I think I can not do another second of this
I know some of it is so tough it is
and especially when somebody's planning lunch for you and they know what's good for you I think when we do it ourselves we take the easy way sometimes that's true that's true so
thank you for calling thank you for participating thank you
guess it's logical to ask do you exercise any?
unfortunately very little much less than what I need to I'm about the same way I do a little bit my job kind of hinders me from exercising I'm a night operator here at a industry down here and I don't really get out a lot to exercise
I am an assistant teacher in business technology and I think the most exercise I've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids questions it keeps me pretty busy but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going
and it really exercise is so important it is
and I realize that that's the way I feel I'm used to being in pretty good shape because when I was in high school I stayed in pretty good shape played a little basketball and stuff like that but I've got now I'm in college and I go to school during the day and work at night I can tell that I've not really done a whole lot
when you exercise what do you do? do you do it at home or a club or I usually play at home we live out in the country so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play or a lot of times we're up at the church we'll play volleyball stuff like that
I got a hold of richard simmons tape really?
what is it I can't even think of the name of it right offhand with the oldies the sweating to the oldies?
sweating to the oldies and that's not bad
that's pretty upbeat so every once in a while I'll put the cassette in and go with it
not often enough to have a routine I'll
my little schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her
but I don't know by the time I get home all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer and my fingers exercise more than anything now that's the way I am I just want to sit down and relax too tired to exercise I did
do you ever ride a bike or anything like that? I started riding my bike about a couple of months ago and I'd ride about two or three miles a day but it would last about a couple of weeks and it got real cold for a little while so I gave it up
here about the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk walk around
because they're enclosed and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter
I've noticed people doing that down here too I'll be in town or something and people will walk around the mall
and it's safe it is fairly safe
that's inside the mall may be not safe going to the parking garage certain parts of it
I know a doctor once told me it a friend of mine suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
I used to do a lot of swimming we have a swimming pool but it's an old concrete pool we've been having trouble with it the past few years so we haven't got to use it much but I love to swim and water ski and stuff like that
the swimming uses more muscles than any other exercise with and the water takes the resistance
and you don't get the soreness I've done some water exercises but our pool is not heated so it's you can't do it year round
summertime only that's the way ours is
you don't when it's twenty some odd degrees go out to the swimming pool it's too cold
hot tubs are not too bad but I could deal with a hot tub those are nice
what part of mississippi are you from? I'm from laurel whereabouts is that? that's way down towards the south not quite on the coast but we're about two hours from the coast
and you do have cold weather down there? ma'am it started about yesterday I believe it started raining and got real cold
ours started thanksgiving
and from there just today was pretty but sunday the snow and ice came in
and there was no exercise
my name is donna donahue and I live in plano texas my name is lowell and I live in raleigh north carolina
do you want to start or should I start? go right ahead
I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in we have three children and they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball and my little girl goes to tap dance and my little one goes to preschool and I'm home with the children just do a lot of running around it seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type life what about you? I'm single and I live in a town home here in raleigh
and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area
we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes
and at the time that I bought this one it was just a much better arrangement for me personally I'm not home a lot I travel a great deal with my job
so it was easier to have a home that somebody else looks out for the maintenance was sort of maintenance free
that sounds pretty good for I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends to maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds and it's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it it's it certainly is
sometimes I think it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear that's the main thing when I was shopping for one I wanted to make sure I couldn't hear my neighbors and that was
so I bought one that's more like living in a once you're inside you don't know you're in a town home
that sounds lovely it is they're kind of built on a catty cornered instead of side by side
so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you
so in your area then there's probably a lot of career type people that have those type homes and definitely
and the area that we're settled in is definitely young families with kids they're still doing a lot of building in the neighborhood so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we're from the northeast and seems like a people just don't or also don't have any family around so it also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors but we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of florida but don't want the cold of the northeast
so they settle sort of in between
is it very wooded around where you are there lots of pretty trees and
as a matter of fact this particular community that I live in is very wooded
how pretty it is nice
I do miss that around here in plano there are very few trees and it's pretty flat and kind of barren and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall and the landscape is much different here in texas than it is in the north or even where you are we definitely have a lot of trees here
a lot of leaves to rake up too but fortunately the home owner's association does all that
does that that's another plus I don't have to worry about that and this is the time of year we're starting to lose they're all falling now
that's right that's right they are I'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not much just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks and if you didn't do anything about it then they'd probably the leaves just blow away
it's not too bad do we have to speak for a certain amount of time? I don't think so
it was really nice speaking to you it was good to speak with you too
and have a happy thanksgiving thank you you too
you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team or who you think will be doing well this year
where I'm from the atlantic coast conference is a very big conference and course we have duke university that was the national champions last year so I'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year they have a lot of the same players back is this the n b a?
this is college basketball this is college
we have carolina and duke and georgia tech and n c state teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty
so hopefully we'll have a good year I don't really follow the n b a very closely and that's probably all I saw we have moved in the last couple years from utah to texas and there's so many colleges and universities in texas we haven't really followed them too much and none of them are our alma mater so that seems to help
do you like professional basketball? I follow it especially around the playoffs so course I was real familiar with the utah jazz and the mailman or karl malone was pretty big thing and the lakers have always been amazing to watch
I did keep track a little bit of the mavericks they've not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with tarpley
and maybe now that that's over they'll come out of it but
that's an up and coming team though I hope they do something they need to or they're not going to have any of the team left at all that's somebody you can get behind and be patient
kind of like the cowboys I guess
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons they coming out of it this year we'll see if it's held on but I think chicago will probably with the n b a again the bulls?
they'll probably be pretty good course the celtics are always really good too with their players
that's true be interesting to see how the olympics does this year with all the n b a players playing on the olympic team
that's true it will be interesting
it will certainly be different I don't know how close I'll follow them though and the season hasn't started yet I'm usually more the end of the season person and we need to talk about baseball and so my atlanta braves
I really do the basketball season's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks it's it's a long season it is it is and that's why I've I guess my mind went blank it's like last season was so long ago and I haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet so
but this wasn't a good subject but we'll see how our predictions come true it's a little early
we definitely will it's good talking to you good to talk to you
I don't know do you do a lot of camping?
my husband and I haven't done a whole lot of camping but we bought a van last year
and we were hoping to do some camping in the van we did go camping in oklahoma last year we camped in a tent and there were two other couples with us and there was uh state park so
and it was really nice up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them aren't some of them are pretty rough
they just have outhouses they don't have a shower room or anything but some of them are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms
but I don't know I've been camping a couple times but I'm not a real avid camper a lot of people I know are but I don't
I don't like really camping in the rough I like the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that we went once to a lean to and it there wasn't any electricity on the camp site but it was all right we only spent two nights there I wouldn't want to spend more than two nights I wouldn't want to go for a week but two nights is good
that would be much especially there was a little store close by so it was pretty nice
the campsite that we went to was an area that it's right on a big lake and there's a lot of boating out there and we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still too cold
it was pretty early in the year up here you got to wait until august until the water warms up
it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly I don't know I have a tent and I fluff out in it in the backyard and stuff but this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get it's dirty
so you can't keep the dirt out of the tent I don't know we have a seven year old it's pretty funny stay out
we have a dog and that's just about as bad as a kid he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times and use it as a play
they like to play in them
I don't know how you can really keep the inside of a tent clean I don't know
other than taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and sweeping it out everyday it's really hard to keep the sand and dirt out of it what we were doing we were just going to say we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night no going in and out or what he wants to do was play in the tent it was this is not working you can't do that you get the tent all dirty did plus you get it all wet we were at a beach site too
did you have a big tent looks like a sitting area type like a two room type? but I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice and up here we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime
we don't really have a problem with that in these areas and in oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a problem with bugs and I noticed that I know that I said that's I've lived back east before they they're terrible they're really terrible but there's this one campsite that it just some of them are known but there is one that's out in this big lake and its mosquitoes are terrible and then there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man made reservoir and there's no bugs that's the whole thing that everyone told me I was going to go to little river state park that place is great there's no bugs
but because we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected bad by it but really got it almost destroyed the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes they're so bad
it's a really nice area I've been there before and it's I couldn't imagine living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued with mosquitoes and you can go outside in the daytime all right but the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
just the very second it's really strange they must work on that it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out
have you ever taken any of those lights have you ever used those? I never really noticed how effective they were but because that wasn't really I bought them I really didn't get to use them like there's mosquitoes let's turn them we just sort of lit them
and we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes so we didn't really contribute it to that but I think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes I can't see all this little smoke buckets
they work but they're suppose to work really well
I'm in my paperwork here that's what I do when I wait for a phone call I get in my paperwork to find my most important parts but I don't know if I'm going to go I wish was an avid camper and I could really talk about gardening or something you can talk about that a lot
but I do want to go again we just moved into a house so I don't think camping maybe in the backyard but I don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer
I'd like to go camping cross country I just got married less than two years ago so we don't have any children yet so it's easy for you to go
easy to pick up and go and we have a van and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it
it's not really camping the way most people picture camping in the tent but I don't know but that sounds my kind of camping it really does that is to have a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent
or get my brother has a real nice pop up
and he just tows it behind his truck
and he's got three kids so his kids will sleep in the truck in the back of the bed and they sleep in the pop up those they're kind of nice but they're also flimsy when you really look at them but when you get inside they're really nice
everything's really but then when you look underneath them it's just got these little wheels and this little axle it's and then a big windstorm it would pick you up
he did have a problem when he went camping last year in beavers bend oklahoma a storm came in and it started raining really heavy and everybody was trying to flee the campsite everybody was getting stuck in the mud
and what do you do when you get a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck I wouldn't stay in the
theirs was so bad and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up
and they had to get out of there then were they successful?
they were but it took them a little while?
but they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend did they get stuck?
they ended up getting out they ended up helping several other people though that were stuck so they evacuated it
the whole campsite was evacuated
I think some people that had fairly sturdy vehicles or whatever if they had a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water I think they stayed
but everybody that was real close to the water ended up it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream I know I like to get right on the water by the campsite it's so
we have lean tos up here I really like them like I say they're just kind of more sturdy than anything just
they have them right at the campsites? they're lean tos they're pretty nice
it's like a little house except the whole face is open and the one time that we got one it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment I wanted to get one right on the water we had an electrical storm too and it was neat sitting there watching it it was raining when we called home everybody said we were worried about you in that storm
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next?
what do we currently have I have a subaru g o x t what year?
eighty eight I have a ninety honda civic and I'm ready to get rid of it actually
it's not pretty old I had an eighty eight that I really liked and it got wrecked and so I bought a ninety because I really liked my eighty eight and I've had a lot of problems with this one so
you think their quality control's going down over there kind of? you it's kind of funny I know a lot
I think we're going to see that the quality that the japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit while american carmakers are trying to get their put together
so it's true it's definitely true because
but that's one reason I've had no problems with my subaru that's one reason I went with it because subaru had a good reputation for low maintenance so honda does too that's why I was really
there's no question but you have a nineteen I've got to see if I've seen and I've had friends that have eighty one or eighty celicas
and those things just keep ticking
they can rack up a hundred fifty k on them that's true and they're still beating on them that's true
and it's just amazing and then they got and they're not making them like that now not at all
but they're still definitely better than the american carmaker system I definitely agree with you there because I had uh ford t bird before I got my honda and it was the worst car I've ever owned
and that's why I was so tickled with my honda it was just a wonderful car and then it got wrecked and I wouldn't even look at another car
I just went and bought a honda I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want and I really have had a lot of problems with it but I don't know
maybe you need to unload it on somebody I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty but in the first twelve months that I owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months
that's a lot it was I was really disappointed because I was so hyped up on honda so
anyway so what's your next purchase supposed to be? I know this
if you had a choice of your car what would you get? this is going to sound really strange but I really like to have a mazda m p v van I really like those and I have kids so
I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that they're a lot I don't like the new style of the toyota van and the new chevy lumina van
I don't like those styles the m p v is more just normal I don't know how to explain more of an old fashioned type I'm not sure how to explain it
it looks kind of like the chevy aerostar or arrow
what astro is what it something like that
but I used to really like the looks of the m p v because it looks more like a mini van rather than
do you have a family? I have a couple kids
that's probably influenced maybe a little bit but I know that it's got to have a radio it's got to have air conditioning I'm sure you can relate to air conditioning living in arizona
and cruise control and tinted windows that's about it it's got to have those things otherwise I don't care
when I bought my car it was right out of college and I always been looking for something sporty and I ended up getting basically something that I could afford
the only gripe I have is performance I probably a few girls that I've gone out with've had mazda r x sevens and stuff and they're pretty fun to drive so I think that's what I'm going to have to get next time around I keep holding off
and then I could upgrade now if I wanted to but I it's just such a huge expense and I'm just going to keep holding off but I'm definitely going to look for something in the nice sports car I'd like to have a sports car too but it's not practical for me but
I'm in are you still there? there's some kind of problems
are you still there?
this is something's wrong wonder what happened I don't know it sounds funny though doesn't it? but I'll probably
it just depends I know that's what I want but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money for a new r x seven or a supra or something you're looking at twenty five k or something that at least
and so but my ultimate car though the one that I really want is uh five sixty or so mercedes I know new cars aren't cheap anyway but so
maybe someday we all have those kind of dreams too don't we?
what I'd really like to have
that's the only one that I early on it says you there? this is strange
I think something's wrong with this
I hope it's recording
I hope it's not my you there?
it may be my phone it's the only car that says sporty and class so you're right
kind of what I'm but it's at the other one my brother's got a miata and those are fun those are nice
and they're cute cars he had a red miata
and he actually they came out with a european racing green miata that's a limited edition
they're only going to make three or four thousand so he went out and he traded the other one in and got this one I haven't seen those
and I'm but I haven't seen one yet either but supposedly they have some real wood built in to the clutch and all this and the steering wheel
so it's very authentic and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be a good investment if it
no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on but I think
I got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway hope it's not going bad
it's going to bump me out but I think he only spent the low twentys so I don't know
I would have never figured that I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition
I don't know I think the demand's gone all down a little bit I think you can the prices aren't as high and the miata was first introduced and they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they?
the demand is so high that they were going to retail them around thirteen standard and you get your options you're looking at fifteen that's true
but people were buying them for nineteen and twenty
and they may have gone down a little bit
but I they're still pretty much in demand I think there's another car coming in it's supposed to come out and compete with that miata
and I can't remember what I read about that but so that's I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular so it really is
but have you seen the new dodge stealth? the real nice one
and the mitsubishi three thousand g t is the same
the mitsubishi is real nice looking too
that's the same manufacturer those are nice
so they just market them
but those are supposed to be very performance power there is big time the expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand
but those are pretty stripped and there's nothing there's really that one's just more for looks it doesn't have really the performance that the expensive one does
but I've seen one of those and it's not that great because they really
I think they're only around twenty nine k they have better it's not quite as nice for a little bit less
they're not really that bad but I don't know like I said it's still not practical for me I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think there's no way I can do that
I'm being single and no other responsibilities for yourself I've been pretty happy
I haven't tried to upgrade myself right now I could get something nice and upgrade but I'm consulting right now so
I just made my first job hop about eight months ago so
I guess if I was having a dinner party depending on the number of people I might cook a brisket or a roast or maybe a chicken dish
and I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a potato dish and we usually serve fresh fruit and then make a dessert
that sounds good so that makes
we're not real wealthy at the moment last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna and I used my mother's recipe I really like it it's got you cook the noodles and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it and I'm not sure she even puts must be some italian spices in there I can't remember but for the cheese part you mix sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and layer all that that sounds good it's good that sounds good
and then tossed salad and diane get down from there and let's see what else did I serve with that bread do you have bread to go with it?
corn I made french bread with that one too
I have a recipe that's pretty good for that so lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds
I've heard a lot of people say the short cut on the cooking for lasagna they've told me that they go to sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna
I've heard that sam's has a really good lasagna
in fact I think I had it at a party once did you?
it was good I know people that have served it and they say if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy
easy and they said it's good
so that always sounds good to me
I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot
I know seems like I cook a lot of dinners not always for company just for family
so feels like I'm often in the kitchen not my favorite place but a necessity but a time consuming place so let's see what else do we like to have for trying to think what else I like to serve my mother likes to serve taco grandes have you ever had that? I don't know
what that is I don't know what that is
you take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco shell
and you for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some tomato sauce in it and I like to just add picante sauce to get the mexican flavor so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff
and then let's see and you heat up refried beans and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first then you put the meat then you put the grated cheese and then you put let's see what's next then I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the lettuce
and you can put guacamole and katy I'm on the phone get a towel or go change I'm on the phone a little sour cream is good and chopped olives
do you like to make your own guacamole?
we don't make it very often I guess but
I don't very often usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain do they?
I just cut slices off and I like an avocado sandwich too
that's good that's good or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich
I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad
what you want where do they get it? I don't know I guess they don't have it at home
I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe they just said they never had it at home so I was concerned that taking this as a dip I thought sometimes when we have it at home it turns dark on the top so quickly so I just
it helps if you leave the pit in it does that help?
if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it
that's supposed to help keep it from turning brown so quick I'll have to remember that that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would so
that's good I thought maybe that was the trick
that probably helps too so I guess we bought a lot of we've been buying turkey lately instead of beef so
do you want it? even though
we have too the ground turkey the meat is softer and I everybody seems to like it do you want scrambled? so sometimes it seems to be cheaper too so we often buy it we buy it
if you get it on sale so we bought that or we bought the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them or in
I don't think mine know either in fact we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey too it costs less than the other I don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it
poultry instead of the beef and pork less cholesterol
I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight
I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve I always like dessert
one salad that we always like my sister in law always brings to family dinners is a I don't know what you call it you mix cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of cool whip that's good and quick and easy that's always good
probably the only family recipe that we make is cheese cake and we take a recipe from my grandmother
it's probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a
what do you think about the metric system? do you find it useable? have you tried much with it?
with an engineering degree of course it's a whole lot easier
because to use you mean
if if somebody is totally unfamiliar with it human nature being what it is we don't like to change
it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal
and it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another we I've lived both in the united states and in a country where they do use the metric system so I've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilograms
that's right and I think that's what hung people up the most is they went wait a minute an inch is two point fifty four centimeters
how on earth am I every going to do the math?
and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and leaving it at that and a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch cause I still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but I'm perfectly comfortable using either
and I think the real problem with this weird conversion you see signs that say fifty five miles per hour and whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour people it's hard to take it seriously
and as long as both were given you basically just don't read the kilometers per hour you just say read the miles per hour one the other one must be for someone else
that's right I don't know even britain has converted over and we inherited this mess from them and
that's right it's all their fault it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they saw the light I don't know why they were more able than we were except I think that they probably just said we're just going to start using the things now and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to
of course being part of the european community if everybody else did it they were probably much more is much more necessary for them than for us that's true that's probably true and america does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting some other model
there's an expression for that with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future I've never heard that one that's very nice so I'm all for the metric system and converting over and I think I guess my feeling is the way to do it is to just start giving weights have a very brief transition period and then just start giving kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert remember me getting a package of something that said one pound this is a package of dates it was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely it said one pound and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty four point six grams
and as near as I could tell seeing that was basically anti metric propaganda cause anyone who would say I can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty four point six grams which of course they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway every time I see something like that I think that's an anti metric argument
I don't think it could ever happen with a quick transition you don't?
I think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such as it is I would think it would take probably two or three years before people could completely cut the cord
that's what I was thinking by quick transition I didn't mean like sweden going over to right hand drive or anything at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything
did they switch? I believe so and I think they did it overnight cause you can't do it gradually that's an example of something you can't do gradually
that's true it has to be kind of a discreet transaction it does a quantum leap from left to right hand drive
interesting and they but that must have taken that was something that had to be done quickly because of external circumstances
but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of continental europe
but that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate
I'm sure so I think it's essential that it's done and I think the real trick is to avoid the a little more attention to human psychology and whereas people want round numbers and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch
and so what the exact the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented really I think
we do have the two liter soda pop bottles I saw that I saw that the other day I don't drink soda pop
but I saw a two liter soda pop bottle so things like that are a good start and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the odd numbers two point two pounds or something I think people will start getting a sense of the metric is the sensible one
that's true sure have enjoyed our talk get back to what you're doing and I'll do the same I enjoyed talking with you too god bless
I don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the jury system do you?
not at all in fact I'm graduating from college in about a week and this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials then you must know a lot more about this than I do
I think the system right now is fine I think it should be by a jury I don't think the judge should have he's just there kind of like the referee
I don't even think that it should be unanimous either what about the idea that one is only guilty when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt? I thought that was the point of a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt
but if there are some people who don't agree it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people
I don't know I you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in prison falsely accused but more than likely the people that are on the jury know what they're doing you have you served on a jury?
never I never have either but my few friends who have say just the opposite they say they're remarkably incompetent and don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out to air and all that
you would think that they would get that in the when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and I know they automatically when you're chosen is you're automatically like a professor in criminal justice or something like that that you're automatically they don't want you on the jury they don't want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system
exactly and they tend and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it anyone can get out of jury just about so it's not really my peers that let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that I would be being tried by a jury of my peers
I'd be tried by a jury of people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things and I don't know
I get a little bit nervous about it and
I've never even been called to jury duty I was called once but I was out of the country and apparently they thought I served so I didn't make any noise about it
I came back and they said the record showed I served but I was out of the country at the time so I'm pretty sure I didn't
I don't know I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system I don't know I definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because there's the classic sort of to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get jury which can have all kinds of prejudices and things that a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have though of course they can too
and it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much browbeat the jury a majority of the jury
that's hard to say so it's saying we don't like the way he looks and let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff
and you also get a lot of juries are extremely and from what I hear I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that juries are extremely vulnerable to sort of emotional pitches the prosecutor will want to show the mugging victim show the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim or if it's a corporation that was harming some individual or something like that they get very much it's just a big faceless corporation let's make them pay as much as possible things like that
so not I'm the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be things like that
I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone
least with the jury you have twelve people that are going to decide
you're the person's fate how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow? I wonder if that's possible? I guess the judge's time is worth too much though
judge they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge
he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together
probably but it's sad though that the people though that somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less
or they fool the defense in thinking that they're because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want of course it's political maneuvering the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone who's going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror neither side wants that they want to find a juror that's going to be most persuadable by their arguments
I wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually I know it's tricky because I know an awful lot of intelligent people who just I'm too busy to serve on a jury
so I'll tell them that and they just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that
they just say do you believe in such and such
I guess it's just that maybe people are upset at court if it was a family member of theirs though that was innocent then they'd want to be on that jury course they would be barred but
but I think if everyone took it seriously
and something you have to do it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury
I hope we're called up before too long
I would love to be called I'm ready to go they just haven't called me up yet they will eventually
it was nice talking with you
it was nice talking to you
I don't think that it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's endangerment to their own life and other people's lives
I agree with that people that are driving like truck drivers and things like that
I definitely think they should be tested and I'm not opposed to any testing because I know I certainly wouldn't want to be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or because he was on drugs while he was there
how do you feel about companies drug testing prior to hiring?
I was tested within my company I think it's kind of a push to weed out drugs in states because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this
and I feel like it's really just within the united states it's okay I think your record should stand for itself that if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over
and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not I think they could save money by not doing that every time if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place what about random testing though
do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?
not if it's done fairly and that's probably my question is how do you know it's done fairly I don't know that you do if it's random then it's random
and that's not necessarily fair
they might tell you it's random
but then it's kind of like a lottery somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries
I know that for instance in the n c double a they drug test and it's not random
I see how do they pick their people? I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season
and from that point on the n c double a does have something to do with it but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem
I see do you and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time
do you think that should be implemented in the work place as a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally
but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights if someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently
and their manager assumes they have a drug problem
if someone assumed that of me I would be upset
it would almost be like a it's an accusation and it's based on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave normal
and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and your supervisor has accused you of using drugs I don't I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from the janitors to the executive management
I agree with that because I know personally myself I've been in the same job for three years it will be three years in august and I've already been drug tested three times what type of job do you have?
I'm an environmental engineer
and I've been drug tested three times and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company I work for is sixty thousand people plus so for some reason I've come up three times that's pretty high statistics does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone?
not at all that doesn't I it's a legal job
so it's really strange that is odd I was drug tested not for the job I have now but for the prior job but I know that the job I had before that the job I have now requested my medical record from my old company
so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion
for instance does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say we've already drug tested her and she came up negative I don't think they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I didn't
they don't know that I don't use drugs they just tested me once
but I used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen were clean
and since I was just one of the office folk I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly but I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly just across the board
and are they tested random? they're all of them are tested once every three they're it's a rotation
I see but it but again it depends on what job you're in
the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much
but they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the drug testing schedule is
I see they say we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here
so they know that and that's it's made very clear upon hiring
have we spent our at least five minutes?
I think so seven twenty five
nice speaking to you nice talking to you
we're talking about capital punishment
how do you feel about that lenore?
I am very much for capital punishment wonderful I am too one hundred percent
my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus
and I've been raised around prisons all my life all your life and I believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent there's no deterrent that's right there's just no deterrent
that's right and so many of those kind of people they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so unless they really make it rough on them going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent I don't think
especially not a federal prison I don't know what oklahoma's laws are but texas's are I don't know it's no one's it's not the judge's fault I don't think it's just the way the law is down here our prisons are so crowded that they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two
the state's prisons were under a mandate to it was over crowded and the federal came in and said you have either got to build more prisons or let people go that's what ours did same thing
and finally our governor at the time who is not in office now came in and said where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose under early bail or early get out
but we have the death penalty is not given often but there have been it's not here either really
and I maybe it should be given sparingly but I do believe it should be befitting the crime I do too but the way the courts are set up they've got so many chances for appeal but I think it needs to be expedited if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of a crime that's deserving of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it
of course they're entitled to a speedy trial that's right
but then they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals
so somehow it doesn't really balance out too much that's right somehow it just doesn't it works and then again it takes too long for it to work
and it seems even though that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that I'm tired I just want out
I'm tired of fighting it
then the system just keeps on it
and at that point I really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process I do too I think that needs to and I don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably but
part of that is the overcrowding of the court system that's true it is overcrowded because there's so much problem with the people on drugs because that with the drugs they're robbing and killing and that's why it's filled the prisons up so much I think
it doesn't help them any at all it doesn't
and of course your court system when you get into the appeals I don't believe criminal is in a court by itself and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there that's true with all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things but
we've gotten into a very litigious type of life haven't that we though we really have but I'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment
I just I'm very muchly for it always have been always will be
I just feel like their crime and punishment and if you don't have the punishment you double your crime and that is just personal feeling it's not going on facts I think the facts would probably back it up it could be supportive it's supported with facts though but what? it could very easily be supported with facts I
I guess we're forced finally to do a lot about air pollution I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels are being experimented with ethanol and other types of fuels
one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from? or sources I assume that the major sources are cars and factories
that's what I would think but I don't know for sure
I just know that acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from comes over the border from us
I think the automobile definitely is an area and any industry that burns and then I don't know about chemical pollution I'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air I know we have a lot of the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick
but I don't know if that affects outside seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes
I guess there's been a lot of pressure to do away with the c f c's in these spray bottles which has been a real problem
that's destroying the ozone isn't it? again that's what I hear and there's this big debate apparently about whether there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last I heard it was discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially that's
it's kind of scary it is scary and I think it will continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively
we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
I think something too that you probably see in older states is where people will use their fireplaces I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that
I think it will in los angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using barbecues gasoline lawn mowers
and it's really bad in places like los angeles and it's gotten bad in denver
and it's not too bad around here although you see it more and more in the sky and people in this country are really wedded to their cars
and our economy seems to and this is one of the big problems
in this area too since in texas we're so spread out
we have to drive so far but I know in colorado I have witnessed that where it just stacks up when the rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can when we've been on vacation or something drive into fort worth or dallas and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets that makes a lot of sense I hadn't thought about it that way but it
you don't have to have mountains that are stopping it
and they making more and more high rise buildings so we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago and I think
it was pretty clear here and I think that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is an organism of sorts and that there is a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it
and we're going to feel it and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy in this country whether people are willing to get out of their cars
and in this country the solution that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars
and I have a little sports car that I enjoy using and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but I think we're going to have to make some fundamental changes and I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and houses we sell and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but lynn
do you have any pets?
I have a dog and cat now what are their names? tibby and liberty which is the dog and which is the cat?
tibby is the dog and liberty is the cat wife and I we have two cats
one's real nice but the other one is a she's pretty wild
ours are pretty calm are they just house pets?
that's what ours are too
our cat we got from the pound the night she was going to be put to sleep so that's why we call her liberty that's a nice story
do you want to hear about my other animals I've had? I've had a skunk
I've had a burmese python I've had rats I've had mice
let's see I've had gerbils I had a son that was an animal lover
so at one point I had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house
the skunk was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?
it was litter trained
and we had it perfumed
and it was very aggressive
but all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house and the skunk
and the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa
nobody came near it when he was there I had a dog one time and he chased after a skunk and got sprayed
so we had to give him a tomato juice bath and get him cleaned up
ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them but the glands had been removed
but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to back up and get ready
one other question we had is why do you have pets? why I don't know I think they're kind of nice to have they're kind of just relaxing to pet and to I don't know when they sit up on your lap and stuff like that just kind of enjoyable to have I don't know something giving you some affection as well
I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog what do you think?
that'd be the best way to be do you like big dogs or little dogs?
we had a german shepherd
and he had dysplasia
and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went
so when he died we got a little one
but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old and it just was almost cruel because
almost cruel for him to walk
he couldn't get up he couldn't walk he was a hundred and twenty pounds so it was a chore
so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry
and then we've had three cats in our married life and we've got a calico now we've got a calico cat too
do you? she's the nice one we used to live in an apartment and our cats never went outside but the neighbors used to let their dogs out and our neighbors were kind of slimy and our cats wound up getting fleas from the apartment that we were in
so we had to flea bath them and it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all
don't even talk to me when I was single I had gone away for the weekend
and my husband then fiance was to keep my cat and he let her out and my house was loaded with fleas you walked in and your legs were just black
and we had such a time and never got the cat back
I found it in the street I was a social worker at the time and found it
since you live close I don't know if you know about what louisville is doing with recycling or are you familiar with any of that?
I know that we have some relatives that live around the area in there
I know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there I read when they first started doing that in the paper and I read about that I was just praying that that would be in our area because we've been recycling for quite some time and we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a metco which is a real pain
so if they would come up curbside recycling
they'll help you recycle because there is some bins behind wal mart that take some things
have they moved them behind wal mart?
because I finally asked because we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of wal mart and I ask in wal mart and they said they moved it just behind that's really nice to know because we were doing the same thing because to take it to a metco you have to take it when they're open which is always a real pain
and so when that thing came up in wal mart parking lot we thought this is great and we started taking them up there and then all the sudden it disappeared I didn't know and we're going there goes our recycling place
that's really nice to find out that it's behind there we pretty much do plastic milk cartons and newspapers I couldn't even think of what you call them
plastic milk cartons newspapers and cans and glass is really the four things that we do aluminum cans?
that's about what we do too and really that's really about it is there any place else that really takes anything other than that that you know of?
I guess down kind of in north dallas there is a place that will take almost anything
we just don't have the room to store all that much I know I don't want to be running down there every week or whatever I know I know
we're kind of the same way at first you at first it was a real hassle and I'm wondering are we really going to do this but you kind of get into a little routine where it is automatic now to throw different things in different places
so I just go we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there we just kind of dump things in each one if we get them so
those milk cartons take up so much room they do too
and they're impossible to crush you can't get the down to any size if you get four milk cartons that fills up trash bag pretty easily so
I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago
we were using baby food and there was so many baby food jars kind of what started it
some of our neighbors were doing it and so when I found out some places to take it and they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there and I know that they're going to use the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing put lights and stuff that will be good
so if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum I would just assume give it to the city of flower mound to do something with let somebody get something out of it
that's true and they won't raise our taxes
I was kind of hoping with do you work for t I?
I don't I have a friend of mine told me about this program is the reason that I'm
there was a t I has got this organization called t a d which is t I'ers against drugs and we're recycling aluminum cans up here just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways and that's they use the money from that to fund this t I'ers against drugs program it's t I doesn't give them any money everything is made from that and they had talked about having a thing like one saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home
and I'm kind of yeah I shall they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it that was going to use it for good so
sounds like you have a little one just like I do
she'll be two in july mine was two in december
it was good to talk to you
it was nice to talk to you I know they've started over in richardson where my dad lives they pick up newspapers I think do they really curbside pick up?
I really hope they do that in louisville it would make it a lot easier on all of us talk to you later cindy have you seen dances with wolves?
I haven't have you? that is a wonderful movie
it's not the length isn't too long?
we all heard different opinions about it you don't even realize it
one that it was too long and they thought at certain points that it was going to end and it didn't and it kept going on and I thought it was great
I've seen some different clips of it and it looks good it's just I haven't had the time to go to the movies lately and I heard a story about there's a certain scene in the movie where they're on a buffalo hunt
and they have a particular child actor who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo
and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was neil young's buffalo
I can't remember what they said his name was but he has a fetish for oreo cookies
and he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies
that'd work for me let me tell you I thought that was really funny
I've seen another clip of the guy that plays in murphy brown I don't know his name but he played the character in it that was very dirty
I saw the one clip of him and it was first I guess he was taking kevin costner to the site where he was going to be or whatever
that was rather gross the wagon driver
but other than that I've heard the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful
and the costuming was
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that the indians all appeared to be wearing new things
and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age the material
they did very authentic reproductions of the actual stuff
the styles but they didn't age it quite enough it seemed
but it was a very good movie
I guess I will have to see it then what have you seen lately?
actually have been to the movies I think the last movie I saw was misery I didn't see that
very suspenseful I don't like stephen king
I really don't either but I went with someone and once I was there I couldn't believe it's an excellent movie
I wasn't sure because just generally that kind of scary stuff I just don't want to have anything to do with it
it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful it's not I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something
in the book apparently she cuts his feet off but in the movie she disables him but not by cutting his feet
she breaks both of his ankles
and that I couldn't watch but you could tell when it was coming
so that was so that he couldn't leave her cause she it still just seems a little twisted to me
I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all
as far as that goes you wouldn't like to see anything happen to anybody but it was just how she got so caught up her emotions
and she feel madly in love with this writer
and there was this but she was a killer and the character prior to that had been someone that had killed other people
but no one knew that
but we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately I know we don't see movies at the movies a lot
the last we did go see dances with wolves and we went to see not without my daughter but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape and then we rent them
now I want to see sleeping with the enemy
that looks really good too that looks good and there were a couple others that I just haven't had the time and silence of the lambs
I I'm intrigued by it but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet
I don't think I want to see that either I know I don't think I could I think we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay
so it might not be as I think they may be playing up some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects
we went to see the jagged edge I liked that movie
so it seems like that kind of thriller suspense and not real strange in other ways
I guess that's about it it was nice maybe we'll talk to you again
it was nice talking to you ready to talk? I guess so
I want to talk about our family budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it
and you can help me out a little bit tell me how yours works
at the I introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when I said that we're on the east coast now
my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that we both decided we wanted to move to north carolina
and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget
and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought was realistic
and so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently so you see
that throws the budget out of whack real fast we actually planned for about one year
that because it never occurred to us that it would take seven months that was smart
and what we did was just decide how we had been spending our money before
and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down
and we really lessened our living expenses more than what we thought we would that's great but
did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of just our own design
and the but we've had budgets that didn't work when our of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
we spent too much money until our children went to college so tell me about
do you all have a budget?
we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of things and did really have a real strict budget but the about and to our when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just dirt poor then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well and then moved from california where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved and moved to texas bought a house immediately which of course is now devalued with the housing market wonderful
so I don't know if we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live so since we have a three year old and a two year old now three and a two year old
that threw our budget really out of whack too an we have been just forced to budget much more because I quit working to be home with the kids and we just really have I don't know we've tried different times we've done a survey of taking the past three months of where all the money went
and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like there's times when we just have to get out where we'll go and get a baby sitter and we'll go and we'll blow fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something I think that's important for your budget to be for it to work though you have to do something
that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for birthday for somebody or we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age whether they're jordache new or whether they're something of course not
and they're both boys so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes but that's the hardest part for us is that it's really budgeting and some extra things that are more nonessential items I found that the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents
we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before
and I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends
on your friends that's true that's true we have so many unexpected things come up so often with we both have older cars and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars on the car in two months or something
and a lot of things like that really are hard to plan for and I really do I think you have to budget those things though
kind of put in a certain amount per year
you're going to have on extra expenses for car although so much per month anyway
and that really should be in your but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions is to let's see I forget which way we do it we don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back at the end of the year so that's not a good way to you don't want the government to spend your money you want to be able
that's what my husband said so this last year he changed it of course we didn't get nearly as much back and it was better find another way of saving money but I do realize that that is realistic for some people
and it was for us for many years
and if that's the only way that it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the year then doggone it that's what you should do
because we don't miss it we really don't when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff but we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the expenses for college already eighteen years away or whatever
I was just reading an article in a north carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing letters of applications to universities
she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done
I guess where there's a will there's a way? that's fantastic
I have enjoyed talking to you
I enjoyed talking to you too and don't spend any money this weekend I know we'll have to stay home and mow the yard
I talked with people from richardson and plano and the first three days and then yesterday I talked with someone from pennsylvania so because it's the
I've only made this is only my third call
I tried to make calls two different days and I couldn't get through I know sometimes I just I'm in it just takes a very long time so
does it? I've been trying to do that and sometimes I just can't wait that long I know
so I just hang up because it keeps going through the thing over and over again this is hilarious
but I knew as soon as I heard your voice I thought it's kathy kester tell me what books have you read lately?
let's see I can't even think I haven't read any and you're such a reader I know that and I I don't read all that much for enjoyment I read a lot for school but I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading
the last book I picked up was a book by judy bloom
and it was called smart women or something like that
and it was kind of I really didn't like it at all
it was written back in the early eighties
and it was all this divorced woman syndrome of the
it was almost like a pre aids scare kind of thing interesting
it was really an interesting because I right away looked at when it was copyrighted because I could tell by the theme almost when it was written
and it was all about women searching for themselves and a lot of hanky panky going on
that kind of was kind of a pop psychology time when a lot of books like that were coming out I think
that's right and so that makes real sense that that's when it was written
I wasn't really aware that she had written anything for adults I was always just more aware of her
for her young people her books
and she's more famous for that but she has been writing for adults also I'll be darned
and so I thought I'll just try this and see what it was like
it was very the style was very conversational
you would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description
you know how that is and I wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything in print
she has because I remember seeing a new book by her that was out
and I think it was an adult book I'll be darned
but that's the last thing I've read
and it's the last actual book I read that wasn't let's see I think I read when I was on vacation on semester break between spring and summer
and I went to my mother's I read a book that I should have read when I was probably in high school I read jane eyre
I wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute jane eyre? it wasn't jane eyre
wuthering heights? it was pride and prejudice by jane austen
by jane austen that's what it was
and I didn't know what to expect except I had heard that jane austen was such a wonderful novelist and she really was good I was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately
and I just but as I say I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then
because I think I read it in college or had to read it in high school or college
but I don't remember it
and then when jennie had to read it at gettysburg I got her someone
I think it was some actress reading it how interesting
they had an abridged version of it on tape
and so I got that for her and she loved doing that I'll bet
but I remember that was the book
and now I think it's around here somewhere I wouldn't be surprised
I'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it
but I read that and then I'm trying to think usually I try to find something long that I'm going to
if I have long periods of time like christmas vacation or when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while
that's what I do too and that's about it because otherwise I'm reading so much for school I have just started reading a book it's for school but it's for there's a literary not a literary journal it's kind of a journal of the history of ideas that's starting to be published from u t d the first issue doesn't come out until next year but
I'm doing some reviews of books to sort of recommend whether or not a full scale review should be done for the journal
how neat and I've it's really neat because these are brand new books and I got this one
most of the stuff is on literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that
this one is on johann sebastian bach and it's a biography that is really interesting
that's fascinating it's fascinating it really is
but it's so long I don't really have the time to read the whole thing but I think eventually I'll go back to it but it was written
the copyright is nineteen ninety one so it's a brand new book
it's a brand new book
that would be wonderful to read something like that
and this man really shed some light on some aspects of bach's genius and the more sociological things like the idea that to be a musician was as much of a family occupation as anything
families had just loads of musicians
and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these all passing it from one to the other that's right and
that's the way it was back then so
that's interesting it was just really interesting if that's kind of what but I have to not only am I reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also because the board of advisers for this journal right now doesn't have a really respected name who's a scholar on music
and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be in that position on the board so
I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not but at least I can tell them what I think that's rough
that's real rough so it's real interesting
that's a neat thing to be involved in because I think my alma mater gettysburg I think they were just starting a magazine that was similar to that it is
I think that's probably sort of a thing to do in small colleges
but that it you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that
because it attracts really a lot people's interest that's one way it's really good public relations for small schools I think so
but another one of my projects this summer it's helping a professor compile a bunch of translations of various poems for a book that he's writing and so I'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of french people
translations what do you mean translations of for instance a baudelaire poem that was written in the french and then has been translated into english by various people
I see and the translations are all so different from one another all different
that's interesting so it's multiple translations of single works and that's right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as my work is just kind of compiling all that for him so that's great it's real interesting
you really lift me up to a different
here I'm dealing with cleaning the stove
and let me tell you there are days when I would prefer really doing that
I wish I were dealing with baudelaire
that would be nice I don't know if I've told you but this is not on the subject
tell me about china cry
china cry was basically the true story written by this lady who was a native chinese who was raised by christian parents
and her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty nine revolution I see
although she herself had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other christian portions of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera she had always felt a very strong leaning in this direction and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty nine occurred and most churches were either banned or all the clergy and so forth were killed or imprisoned and the property confiscated she was safe because she had not officially joined the christian movement
as she grew up towards maturity her parents her dad was a doctor and he was rather well to do in the old regime and the communist chinese didn't like this at all the bourgeoisie was definitely out of style then
everybody was back to a commonality of one and so they kept picking at him picking at her mother and finally started picking on her and getting her to
they were starting to accuse her of crimes and atrocities before the revolution and had her write her own story over and over and over and the major point of the movie was that she had married this chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court I think I'm leaving out a portion she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had gotten a job as an instructor and they were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers when they decided that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre regime crimes as it were
being a child they kept on and on at her and in the meantime she and her husband were expecting their own child and the people kept harassing her over a period of months and finally they carried her out into the courtyard either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of shooting her or executing her by firing squad
and the lord just said no this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really she's one of mine she is not going to die and the soldiers were blinded when they shot
and her life was spared and this frightened the commandant and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
and course here's this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
she put in for going to and her husband had escaped to hong kong and then she put in to go see him and over time she finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the middle bureaucracy that they finally let her go
and of course she had to walk they stripped her of everything practically besides the clothes on her back so she went across the border to her husband and other child that they'd already had to freedom
and they knew that she wasn't going to come back but she did years later when the liberalization of china happened
and she was not persecuted or anything else like that interesting story
it was very moving too I don't even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly
it was within ninety days that recent
it was advertised over a period of about ninety days I see what you mean
but it wasn't they didn't have it in too awfully many movie houses but it was in the it had large press release I guess what I saw most recently was sort of light by comparison
my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy and we ended up going to see green card green card? green card
and he chose it and it's got this wonderful french actor who's it was his and he's been a star in france and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years but he's never made an american film this was his american film debut
I see and he speaks very broken english and basically he played a frenchman who married an american girl in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country
and because she could claim she was married she could get an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in new york that had an outside garden which is very unusual there
so she was a horticulturist and that was sort of her dream
I see of course they got married and they never saw each other again
except fate through them together and the immigration and naturalization service started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight
and she was a very svelte sophisticated urban new yorker
and he was a poor frenchman who had grown up on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was
he'd been working in a restaurant when they met
and they had to learn all about each other basically in a weekend
just then and it was you knew what was going to happen of course that they would fall in love
they fell into like at any rate and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever they did perfectly
and then he said something because his english was so poor for the most part he was so proud of himself for giving all the correct answers that on the last one he said I never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers so
what do you think about it? how are we doing in recycling? are we
I think we need to do more I know I need to do more they have programs around where you can reach the they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up
but I have a hard time of separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper
and I just haven't gotten that dedicated yet so I do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot
but there's still a lot more we can do
I don't recycle my newspapers myself but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a clothes hamper kind of thing that you lay your string in then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up
so I figured I might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper
sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it
I don't get the paper every day but I get it on I try to buy the early edition for the coupons the sunday edition so
but then I just bundle it up and put it on the front walk every monday or every other monday and have them pick that up
but that's the extent of what I've done I'd like to be able to do more the problem with a lot of it is it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it and
it's not always convenient to do it and here in lubbock everything's so close I can imagine what it's like up there
I'm not exactly sure where the can thing is but sometimes it's just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them
I went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall
and then I put me a little five gallon bucket and it's just outside the garage door
so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket
do those can crushers work good? I got one from payless cashways and it's actually metal
it's not plastic I didn't want to buy a plastic one
because those things would just snap
but payless cashways has them and they're metal and I don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have up there but it was only seven dollars not too bad
I'd have to check into something like that because we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here but occasionally we have some around
but for other kind of cans it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they I don't I don't think it would crush steel cans it's pretty tough
so I don't know I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but I need to look into it more you could probably just
it sometimes even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper they won't take paper that's shiny
they won't take any lint free paper or I work at t I
so does my husband we do a lot of recycling out there
now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but that's just now come on board
we've been throwing paper out there away for years and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out
I don't know what I haven't I'm sure they're probably doing that here some I'm sure they are t I is doing it pretty well nation wide I'm sure
I think it's necessary I like it it makes I think it's good that you see these boxes cereal they're now starting to make the packages out of recycled paper and I've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper
and I think they're just fine I bought a I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work it's his birthday we're pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag
and it's just got happy birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and it's just a paper bag
and it's really cute
but I think we're doing better and better all the time still don't
I think we're becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more so there's not going to be any room shortly
the office I don't know what new york does about theirs I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere
it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere but I think we're getting better at it
I think there's quite a bit more we could do girls put that away now but you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth
I just wish it was a little more convenient to do
seems like you're so busy anyway and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about so it sure is
I think if the cities locally they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so they'll get at it sooner I guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later
get the kids interested in it too they have we tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans
if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people they'll save them for us there's no problem there
but what do you do with them in the meantime?
that's right I don't want a garage full of cans
that's right who does people don't have room for that kind of stuff
they're not prepared for it
and in texas they're just get things like that they just get bugs in them so they do
so you don't the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that's for sure that's right so
I'm pretty lazy about it right now everything goes into one thing and goes out to the
pick it up so myself about the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans
I need to get better at it so if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way
that's right that's right if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then we'll get there that's true
that's right thank you for talking to me
thank you for calling I no problem take care
what you mean my voice?
I am from kentucky originally so
the topic today was gardening and lawn care?
I know we are about to hit it in few minutes I figured I could make this call and get it over with we are going to mow and trim and edge
and that is all we have been doing all weekend
you know what? it seems like we are doing it here forever we bought a large house that was completely unlandscaped it probably was up to your shoulder in thistles
that was all that was there and we hired a professional landscaper to do it and I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time
and so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year probably through the fall too and rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires more care than I am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies
how many kids do you have? just two
but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more how old are they?
four and five four and five
I have got a four year old and a four month old and an eight year old stepdaughter
I have a twenty six year old stepson
and I do not know if that counts you do not have to tend to him
I did for many years so you did it is over with he is gone it is over with
back to gardening are you one of these howard garrett organic enthusiasts or a neil sperry nuke the lawn with chemicals?
if I can just nuke it I would do it but I do not I just it is like I will get out there and pull my weeds I do not have a real big front yard but I do have half of it is a flower bed just about all by the porch
because the porch is pretty big I live in town but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts I do not like it and I just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff and I just plowed through the whole nine yards got up everything there was some plants that are just spring bloomers
and I when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking
so I just broke all them off it was a hyacinth have you ever seen those?
they are pretty in the spring but the leaves I do not like them once
are you sure they are hyacinths? because that is a bulb it is a bulb
you should of just ripped the whole thing out because I like the plant in the spring I love those pink flowers they are just pretty so I just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because I want them to come back up next year
have you had is this the first year they have been up?
let me tell you they do not come back very well at all maybe they will up further north but down and you are not that much further north I have probably planted around here maybe six hundred bulbs of hyacinths?
I have done hyacinths of everything
but I have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming because they do not take the heat here and if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny they will?
about the only bulb that repeats well in my area is the daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb I have got some daffodils and everybody down here calls these flags the irises I guess
they call them flags? that is what they call them down here they get just one bloom on the plant I am not sure what they are called
when does it bloom? but I do not much
I think they are stopped blooming now in the spring it has got
and what color? they come in all different colors the blooms are on some of them is yellow purple white just all different colors
and you only get one of them? per bulb you get one big flower that looks like a lily I do not know what they are called I have always called them I do not know what I have called them but when I come down here everybody told me they are flags
you know what I bet you they are? and I am a pretty good gardener because I have killed a lot of things here and I have planted a lot of them and I work on a landscape committee for our neighborhood
and our neighborhood is a planned development with seven hundred and fifty five families
but we have about sixty acres that we have to plant I am going to bet you that is a lily because it is it is some type of lily
and I will get is it what color is yours blooming? I have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue which I would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color with little purple spots that it will fade into a solid purple
and what does the foliage look like? does it fit that green spiky leaves now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a lot higher and it is a bulb
I bet you what those things are is a dutch iris dutch irises
I bet you it is a dutch iris
on the flower does it have a beard on it at all? any kind of fuzzies? I really do not know
I am going to bet you that that has got to be blooming this time of year it has they are dead now
I was just going to correct myself they bloom in the spring
because they would have bloomed pretty early
they bloomed in the spring
right about after the daffodils? right about the same time or after
I will bet you those are dutch iris I took and just mowed over them last year
and we have been I do not much care for them after the bloom dies they are not pretty and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves
but I took them out of my front yard and I just threw them on the side intending to transplant them or throw them away or something and forgot about them through the whole winter
I went out there this spring and they had took root right where they were on top of each other and they told me that they are the hardest things to kill
but they are real easy to grow does that help?
then it is not a dutch iris then I am not sure what it is they said that they are irises it is some type of iris though
but they call them flags down here
I am not so sure that texans know what they have got
I do not know what it is I am just getting into gardening this year
did you just move down here? we moved here a year ago last spring we moved in this house may of last year so it was really too late to do much
who because I have probably got a big circular driveway the whole perimeter bordering the house is all in texas wildflower beds and I am into that
and it looks quite formal it really does it looks quite formal that is
but it has been about three or four years of playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here what kind of blue? I want blue and purple and just different shades of that because my house is gray you want blue? and blue looks so pretty against it
blue is hard do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all summer? I bought I would like to have one that would bloom next year too that will come back up
put in a perennial blue salvia the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall
and it will send out a flower spike you will see them blooming now it is a wildflower here but you can get them in the nursery I am looking for a pen I want to write this down because that is where I went this year because I waited too late to really plant stuff but I did not know that these hyacinths like I said I do not know anything about plants I did not know the hyacinths were going to die
the nursery men will sell you things here and they are kind of in a labor of love the other thing to do if you really like the hyacinths is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them that is what I did with my plants I had bought these celosias or whatever
and they will not grow down here perennial blue salvia salvia
and now that will bloom all summer long but it insists on full sun I guess I just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little already grown
and it looks pretty good out there
I will tell you another plant that is purply
it is kind of a purply blue red it is really a pretty plant it is sold down here as purple buddy purple buddy?
it's not it is not a perennial it is an annual but it will take the heat down here purple buddy purple buddy its proper name is gomphrena how do you spell that?
g o m p h r e n a gomphrena and is sold as purple buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower
and they make about a foot high plant and they send out this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it but that purple ball
the topic is selecting care for the elderly
and I don't have elderly parents yet but not that far in the distant future what about yourself?
my parents are both in their seventies my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies and my father and stepmother are not in very good health so this is something that is a concern of yours right now
it is are they living independently right now? they are they are have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?
not for them my mother and stepfather have set up an arrangement where they have a large home and two of my sisters and their families one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home it's got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms and they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen and my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home that sounds the ultimate
unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home even at that point most care can be given in the home that sound like just an excellent solution you must feel real good about that
I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also I read a lot and then I know people then have visited nursing homes and have had great grandparents in the nursing homes and it was not a happy situation for any of them and we have a very active nursing home here in plano that has activities going all the time and they have even the people that are wheelchair bound and really are incapacitated go and participate in olympics
and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here
so there are a lot of activities going on all the time and this is a nursing home it's not a senior citizens home so that the people are really really in need of a nursing home
they need the nursing care
but it's a very expensive solution it's I think we just listen to the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes it's just a matter of finding a good home
and then of course there is always the problem of being able to afford either of those solutions
and that is what is scary and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best
and that's right I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating
and he apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so but when the family came in to see him they had not been made aware I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance and I overheard their conversation and when the family walked in his wife and daughter and son in law they were not even aware of what had happened
so I told them he strangled on some chicken and the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or so and I thought what a shame they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
and then they could have done that well at home
and then she was upset he had on two different shoes one of which was not even his he had on a pair of slacks and the wife said these are not his slacks' and she said I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean and you hear these stories all the time
this was just something that I witnessed to you happened
and at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour
and with just a curtain between us and
they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth and he was definitely just by looking at him and the way he acted you could tell he was in need of nursing home care but the family were all talking about putting him in another home they said he will not go back to that one
I'm glad they have a solution to do that
I'm glad they the option I know
I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford and there was no choice my ex husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for seven eight years and it's just her condition deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home
the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from people who have been independent all their lives
this was a really neat vital woman and you get in a nursing home and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life
and I do not know what the answer is but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there and I think it does a lot of it goes down to just money and family support
that's right if you have family that you can live with visits everyday
I really I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care you would do your research and you would go visit
visit and hopefully they would have it so that you could go there anytime
because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit suspicious
I remember my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time but I guess alzheimer's would come as close as anything she really was not aware of what she was doing
and I can remember she had several strokes and the nursing home was right next to a hospital and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days and it was just like keeping something what? do you want to start?
you hit it doesn't matter we're discussing the capital punishment I believe you are right I suppose I should have
which I am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done I guess I hate to see anyone die
but I guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse I don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
I agree I'm capital the capital punishment is necessary in many cases but the it's not a deterrent or our jails would not be so full there wouldn't be so many people in death row
I think it needs to be something a throwback to where they did a public execution where it's visible
something not gruesome but something more where people know that it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people if you committed a certain crime you were going to receive a death penalty and it was going to happen to you
no stays of execution no loopholes no and even that I don't really know if that would help I think a lot of these people do it mainly because of t v and
notoriety the double reason they see it being done on t v and also the fact of notoriety they become well known they are almost like a big star
but they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal
they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years
that they are going to write a book they are going to go on talk shows they're that's a reward for a heinous crime rather than having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life
in complete of any notoriety I think if they went according to the bible where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life
you take a life you give yours
that's for sure there's exceptions to the rule if it's an accidental taking then you look at that but most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure I don't like to see that
I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again
they will not if he's killed he can't do it again it
that's correct if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is executed the death penalty
but the chances are not great that that will happen
but there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that I guess I been thinking about it and I don't have a definite opinion but repeat crimes maybe not the more mild ones but more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but beating them half to death that's right just for pleasure too and I guess you've got to look at something like that
do they deserve to remain on this earth too?
you could carry it to that if they are a repeat offender and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes
and of course of battery or assault or that is not a capital crime you wouldn't be able to under our system
china and a few other countries have a little different view of that you get caught with dope there and you die period
there is no appeals there is no
why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you
do you have any elderly relatives currently in an nursing home now? I do
do you? I have a grandmother she's a hundred and two
she'll be a hundred and three in august
and we decide not to put her in a nursing home she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her
even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties
she still has her snap she takes care of her own business this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker but with somebody that needs around the clock care I have seen my family age
I have seen them in the she's been there ten years now and I have seen them age twenty in the time and with the expense and everything
I still think it is worth it if you had a good nursing home and they needed some quality care I would put someone in a nursing home
my mother in law finally they had to make a family decision there's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them live in the same home town and she has alzheimer's it was getting where she was getting dangerous letting strangers in and things like this
but they were very fortunate it's a small town and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mothers and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time
that's good but she really doesn't nobody thought she would adjust but she has adjusted beautifully
that is great but then I am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in colorado she's been taking care of him I don't know how much longer this can last and at that point because he requires round the clock he can't do anything without her he doesn't know when to take his medicine and it's really sad and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for my brothers are not interested in helping me so I would have to move him down here that way I want to see the nursing home if I have to put him into one where I can go see it I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado and
I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas and some of them are limited care too where people can do they have apartment styles but that wouldn't work for him I think he is beyond that where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctors are available if they need them
I know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in austin and allows
the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course I guess all nursing homes there is but
and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you have to be a pauper
it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your care
and that's the sad part about it I and I think a lot of people who do it now in colorado it's interesting I talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then I would send it back to her so that's what would happen
I think that's what most people do you just have to give everything away it's unfortunate
I work at a brokerage firm and I have seen so many people that just have to gift their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home
it's frightening and I guess I don't know how old you are I'm forty six we're the generation moving into this and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us I can't imagine I'm twenty nine
and everybody in my family has always had we don't have any children everybody that has has them later in life
my mother and my father are in their late sixties so they're not that far away I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are
I know and it's kind of you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but something will have to change as more and more of us get older luckily if we could be like your grandmother I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay but you see these people in their seventies it but
most people aren't most aren't that's the problem and that's the bad thing I would hate to have lived so long she lived by herself my grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety one and just did everything that's incredible have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either offering a service or they're introducing some new product in the area and normally when they call you're either in the shower or you're in the middle of cooking something and you have to stop everything to run to the phone
is that one that you're talking about that was the big one I'm talking about I work weird hours and invariably just about the time I'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
and you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
that's true or the ones that are generated by a computer it's just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that I really really hate too I've even had some of them they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
sometimes I get them on my answering machine at home and I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages and I go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all what I would love to see done to stop all of this
we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people I think it's great that freedom of speech in this country and everything but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
I have an unlisted telephone number but I still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand so I do I really feel that's an invasion of my privacy I agree with you on that particular subject there let me see that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door either religious groups or people peddling products if I wanted their products I would have either gone to the store to bought it or I would have called for their salesman to come out
that's true living in an apartment complex though you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations but they still come up to the front door and walk around so usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them there's people coming around and they're trying to sell something or they're from a religious organization and I really hate that I really really do I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago and it was about nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what I would consider family hours time to start going to bed and it was somebody from the jesus christ of latter day saints and I've read a lot about that particular sect and I don't particularly care for it so I especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me I agree with their right to pursue their religion of choice in whatever manner they want to but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment I'm on my turf if I want them there I'll call for them otherwise I don't want to know they exist
I agree with you there if they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and I don't like the way that they do it either and it's their mission that they do it they go door to door and they go out into the public and they actually have the teenagers serving two years in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work and I don't know I just don't particularly care for that at all and that's one thing that I feel really strongly about though is people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting to try and get me to join or become interested in their religion because I have my own the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting I've even gone so far as to put that I've got a storm door on the front of the house and I've put in I don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise cause I still get
that's true I didn't go that far but I probably could do the same thing I don't have a storm door but I'm sure I could rig up something but I don't think that that would stop people it's like they see that word and it says go instead of stop I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do that would be technically illegal it would be harassment
but I consider an invasion of my privacy a harassment in itself
that's true that's true what else? I believe we've pretty much summed everything up
I know but I remember you talked about something you started off and said let me think you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door you said something else I can't remember what it was and I thought yeah that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got to talking about the people coming to you at the front door I'm drawing a blank
is our five minutes up? pretty close to it
pretty close I've enjoyed talking with you
it was nice talking to you too jim and take it easy thanks
what were you saying?
do you work around children when you work? not at all I work with computers
with computers they what do you one thing I
but you have friends that have children I have some friends that have children not that many actually what is child care like in new york? what is I do not really know excuse me too much about child care in new york does the company you work for have child care on premises for employees? excuse me one second
not at all in fact my situation is a little bit strange I was a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in france for awhile and I have just come back and was doing consulting work
so I am just taking a little bit of time off right now
a sabbatical and I might
I hope you can stay as long as possible with it hopefully I can do some consulting work at home and if I can do that it will
that would be wonderful I'll be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care
but I might start to go crazy with it too
it is a little I miss the intellectual stimulation
but at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now and
I think it does when they are real little and they are changing every day
there's and you just miss the little things
and I do not think I would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was one other child with a person
I would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need
that's right maybe if I needed to work part time four hours a day I might do that cause you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time but I just think that when there's two year olds running around the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds that's right and only when the infant screams are they going to go there that's right and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
and I play with her most of the time she is awake and I think that is so important
it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother
such as things for learning gives the child stimulation I think is important and
our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a montessori day care system
and they took infants starting at six weeks and they have a program that was devised by this montessori person and a certain type of stimulations and there's times of day even when the child is awake that they lay quietly and look at certain things they deliberately keep the room not real bright
and they have different things they will put them down on the floor and of course they never have more than five and they will put them down on the floor and I think one of them was a little mirror and some were just different objects that had a definite purpose for kids
and there's something about their eyes
she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's how old is she? she's two months now nine weeks
and she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that
and she's just started that yesterday or the day before
so every days are different
and I think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older and I will probably be going back to work around january whereas she will be about eight or nine months old
a little older and so I think she will be at a I have heard it's a rough age to put them into a
it is because that's when they are clinging to mama
so you might have a real problem with that I think it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying but I think it
so it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place we are just going to have to see how things work out
but that's unusual but I am trying to leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that so that she is used to other people taking care of her
is it your parents or your husband's parents? my parents my husband's parents are in france so it's a little bit harder but during she's met them already
not that she will remember them but she's met them
that's nice when I have three grandchildren another one coming in september and I if they were where I could not get my hands on them I am afraid I would probably go crazy
I like that are they all nearby?
but if you do not have to put them in child care that's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them as or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time
that's wonderful for the child but if I work part time that might be doable
and if you do decide to go with child care you really need to look at what your options are and look at what they offer drop in at times that are unexpected the right now the situation is so tight at many places that it's even hard to have a choice
but since this is people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids
and I just find that incredible and my sister in law is going to have a baby very very soon and she is intending to stay home with the baby
and maybe do some free lance type work at home and so if I go back to work on a part time basis I am hoping I can leave my daughter with her because my daughter will be about six months older than hers
that would be wonderful and
it will be a little rough when she is a very very little infant
but when she is a month or so my sister in law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby sitting for large families
and so she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that I watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work and not be bothered
we might be able to exchange that way
and so we will just have to see how things work out but ideally I think business should have the day care centers there whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether
I do too they hire a couple of people and parents come down to supervise or whatever really well trained people
and have some kind of real good program set up so that when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows c p r or first aid
and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner and have the right toys and the right setting and have an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule
that's real important to little kids she's my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet and it's probably my fault because I do not have a real schedule now but
they adjust to what the parents she's been staying up late at night and sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me
you know that works until they start school
and that's a problem society is geared to a day person and it's I have another friend whose brother and his wife have done this they stay up until all hours of the night
we're going to talk about our lawn and garden chores do you have either one?
I don't do anything with the lawn really but I do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening do you
I we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden and that's fun actually wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because we enjoy that we love fresh vegetables in the summer and it's just one of the things I enjoy doing so do I I had rather be outside than inside any day
so would I do you work during the week outside the home? I do
so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward I work for a school system so I'm able to do that because I get home a little earlier
and I can still do some sorts of things but or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight
I unfortunately am not gardening this year I love gardening in fact I was prevented about thirty years ago with a life membership from the richmond virginia counsel of garden clubs
and it wasn't because I was so good but I organized a very large garden club but I still have
that's wonderful it's always something that seems so odd to me but
but that's and you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too that's neat it has really nothing to do with actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that
it was just that I happened to organize this group that was about seventy people
that's wonderful that isn't that
those numbers were great but it
I think it sounds good I've never belonged to a garden club because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own I've never had the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format
but I know people who do it and enjoy it very much and actually I think that most women's garden clubs that I've been aware of in the past are only flowers what I would like we've spent the last twenty years in oklahoma just moved to north carolina
and we were originally of course from this area from virginia but in north in oklahoma it's the men's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join
and you would have because they do all kinds of gardening and not just flowers like women do
there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of they're women and usually they're the tea type things where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing
but flowers are primarily the emphasis whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more I do flowers sort of look pretty I think so too
but I really like to do the vegetables and I have spent the last ten years being a florist being what? being a florist
what a wonderful thing it was nice it was exhilarating for many years
many of those tanned until the last couple when we had such an economic slowdown
tell me what's in your garden this year since I don't have one
the flowers I'm just in fact I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in I always have geraniums and then I have a shady area that I need to be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun
so I've discovered that impatiens that tried and true turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus because they look pretty in my front garden
but I like the vinca which is something I hadn't they look sort of like impatiens but they're not quite and they're better for the sun areas and of course mine are old theory ordinary flowers marigolds and that sort of thing in my do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds? I don't maybe it's
I don't know maybe this climate is a little better
but in the vegetable garden we grow usually what our favorite is something called white half runner green beans that's do you isn't that funny so is my favorite
you know why because I grew up in north carolina
and that was my mother's favorite bean she always grows five different varieties
but that's the kind that produces the best I think it has the best flavor
and they're wonderful and I pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit my mother picks them when they're fat and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs I like them in between and they're good both ways I like them in between
the flavor is better in between
in between the size wise my mother
my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them and I know I love them that's the yankee way but I think that's another vegetable
of course I love them that way just the thrill of
it is they're two different vegetables that way in fact my mother who is eighty six years old canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year
my mother will be ninety this year and she lives in western north carolina and she would do that if we didn't tell her that she'd better not
but she doesn't have that big a garden but she has a bigger one than I do
and I have four children so and she tends to it herself?
isn't that wonderful
it is it's great it's really her joy and I suppose that's why I enjoy gardening because growing up with it I think so too
we also grow yellow and green squash much to my children's chagrin
and we grow a lot of tomatoes
there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes
so we enjoy that we grow I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family but I actually was successful for the last two years so I'm going to do it again bet you showed them
that's right and we grow broccoli
and I have been very happy about the new way of controlling the worm that gets in broccoli by using the bacillus thuringiansis which is the little in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth I don't know if you have had that problem there or not
but it's a problem that's moving south from the new england area
and they devastate the trees so the government sprays two three times in the spring when the caterpillars are coming along because what they do this bacillus the worms ingest it and it expands in their digestive tract and they die
so that's the same technique that is for any of the other little varmints that get in vegetables so it that's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of handling the problem we could really talk gardening a long time I'm enjoying hearing you so much
it's nice hearing you talk and I wish you good luck have you just recently moved to charlotte? october
so that's not very long so recently seven months and it
the weather is wonderful I love it
that's great that's great it is just terrific rains a little too often
I hope you have an opportunity to garden again I think so I have a little spinach
what kind of puppy you got?
I think she's mostly german shepherd she was a person lives across the street from me brought her home from work because a coworker of hers had this dog appear on its front doorstep
somebody abandoned her and she's only six to eight weeks old
and I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though
she's this young and she's almost housebroken
she actually asks to go out that's great and I was amazed
really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality I don't know I can't imagine what would have been wrong with this dog so I have a dog that god gave us too she just appeared
my husband calls her street dog but we've had her now for about three years
and I just you get so attached to them
I had a last year I had another german shepherd this one was purebred and he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but managed to get him to a veterinarian in time
and on huge doses of antibiotics he actually got over it with seven hundred dollars in vet bills
but he actually was able to get him over that
and then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a cadillac
so I couldn't believe it that was really hard
and that was even harder for I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
so they just felt absolutely awful I bet
and I felt probably worse for them than for me because this fellow's wife who was watching the dog she loved that dog more than I did and she was really attached to it
but it's unfortunate but now I've got another one so how long has it been since the first one?
it was just over a year
it was in march of last year so it'd been didn't have one for a whole year I had a german shepherd before this one and when she died it just absolutely destroyed me I was just
I couldn't even talk about it for months and so I decided that's it I'm not going to do this anymore
and then god gave me this dog so
my dad's like that he had a beagle that he loved and when that beagle passed away he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way
and then the beagle died in about october and by christmas time we went down to the pound and got him humane society and got another one a stray
and she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but mom went an you just do
you can't help it's like a kid
it is hopefully this one here cocoa will live a full life when my doggie that we have now she's mostly golden retriever
the vet called her a golden mix who knows
but she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color
and her nose is that pink
she doesn't have a brown nose and she's sort of unicolor eyes are the same color and everything
so I named her rosebud
and a friend of mine said that she this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had a pet cow named rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name said my cow lived seventeen years
that's not too bad the golden retrievers are good dogs too they kind of get that permanent smile to them they're always always happy I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy and she's so easy going and so sociable
she loves everybody and little kids can just maul all over her
and she just thinks it's great
this friend of mine has it's the same guy that was watching my german shepherd when he got hit but went fishing with him on friday and took he's got a pure bred golden retriever and then I had the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they had a ball romping around
and you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in getting in
and this golden retriever jumped in the really fast moving river current and
actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and I he's just about a year old himself and never had really I don't think he'd swum before
but he jumped in the river did puppy go to?
the puppy jumped into some of the pools but not into the I was careful to keep her away from the fast moving water that's good
cause if she fell in then I'd of had to go in after her
and up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now
and I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but this dog dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and actually paddled up against the current and made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he jumped in again
and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it cocoa didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out
I pulled her out and then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
but she got over it so the german shepherd that I had before we had a little pool
and she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to get in the pool on the first step she'd just get on the first step and lay down in the summertime when it's really really hot
and she'd just lay there on that step and just cool off
I live right across the street from a big lake here it's on oneida lake and I'm wondering if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year I've got the yard's all fenced in so she doesn't run loose but she could go in sometime if I'm watching her
so the one that we had just didn't want any part of that
and she baths she hated baths worse than anything it was just really a fight to get her clean
have you seen canine the movie
you've got to see it especially since you have a german it is so cute
an part of the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's just hysterical
my dog last german shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too and that was the thing I couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't
normally he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it that's how cleo she'd lay on her step
but that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
obstinate obstinate but you really need to see that movie we bought the movie and I don't know how many times I've seen it
and it came on t v the other night and I was watching it again and my husband heard me laughing and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
I'll have to check it out I saw the previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie but it is great
really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately
but I got to do more fun things we always wait until we can rent them
I'm a second lieutenant in the air force and so I travel a lot
and I'm a engineer at the rolm laboratory griffis air force base up here so
that's how I got into the switchboard project and all that so
but it's nice having a dog here the there's just
what's the word I'm looking for lots of affection unconditional affection from the dog that's it not critical at all
they're really wonderful
it's been nice talking to you we seem to be degenerating here so you want to start?
I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation I guess it gives me a perspective on that
I am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women both in society and in the work place there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily now I think the change that I've seen as much as anything is one where couples are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
and I guess that's a significant change that I've both participated in and noticed I agree the equality of the roles now between the sexes has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with the vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men
I have wondered why they allowed or let both the father and mother go and the children are left without either parent to me that's kind of a drawback but I guess it's a price you pay and I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the day care centers
wonder about them in what way? from what I understand there's been studies that these children are more rebellious they term it as more creative but that they are much more contentious
so I guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up in kind of a community rather than a home
I have not to be honest had much experience with children in that situation
I guess one knows one's own storly and I know in my children's case it was one where pretty much up until the older of two was basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force so they
so I guess my experience is just with what we did and so they didn't really go through the child care route
they were able to be home together and we never actually experienced that in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so I guess I anticipate an increasing equality greater presence of women in management roles
I don't know whether there will be an increased amount of surrogacy that we see I just don't know what do you mean?
deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother
sort of rent a mom not to be crass about it but whether one might conceive of the possibility that there might be a kind of a professional mother person for instance that that's strange a nanny sort of?
and I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting story or whatever
I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that in fact I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession that's right that's right
I don't have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent I don't know that I felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs
I don't have boys that didn't bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or as a professional nanny as you put it
maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care
it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting
I know that there are young people characterized as being half my age in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child to come in and live with them?
I could easily envision that to come in and live with them?
or to put their child into a home setting where they would leave at eight in the morning and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids
and you were paying for really high quality care
I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on the order of what I quoted to someone because that's the experience they want and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
and then you might have more control over the morals that they would be taught rather than in a classroom or a day care center
I know the day care centers are not cheap either they're
I haven't ever really looked at them are you aware at all of what they cost?
I know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it they have to go with a baby sitter more or less
but I think it's about sixty dollars a week for two children if I'm not mistaken
and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation and taking care of the children or if the children are at home sick
that is just a rate that you have to pay and
what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society? I think I really don't have a vision
that's okay too I think that they will be more in the work place because the door's open
and it's just human nature to walk through an open door and I would be glad to see that I hope I don't see a lot more single moms but it seems in my experience I'm running across single women all the time
I'm noticing that too and I notice a terming emerging called solo parents that I'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that I encounter in the work place
and that is a little troublesome because the pressures on them are rather formidable it's awful
and maybe that's a change we'll see maybe the possibility of women who deliberately say we'll let the man take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever
I think we've done it
I think we're about done thank you very much
it's been interesting you take care
you take this subject much more personally than I do I suppose
I suppose I do because I've seen a lot of those changes the changes that women have had in not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from
take it back thirty years I'm going back too far from my parents generation when mom stayed home period
and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job unless if you were educated you might teach for a year or two before you got married
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something
if you were a teacher then that was it until the kids were little you weren't supposed to want a job
there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day
and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job and your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care
and we have these wonderful people who are totally prepared to teach your child everything they need to know in day care
but a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job and we'll see how the generations go
I at least for a lot of women depending on what she did
I was mechanical engineer with t I and I did it for six years and for one I had one while I was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old and it just drove me crazy did you
I could not do either well I couldn't put in enough overtime that was or things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is needed because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with work for three months and so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is
that's the thing maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they're going to be there
might have been better
but if you're going to be more professional oriented then to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that doesn't really go with the family
and so it was in my case I just decided that as long as my kids were little I would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer? is that what you're saying?
actually I've found out that I'm not going to go back to being an engineer what will you
I'm a photographer now you've found something else
I have branched out I was a photographer before but when I went to college I felt like I couldn't support myself if I decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby
and I'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so I did that and then I did that for six years and then I stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that it was great
but I was bored part of the time too and I wanted something else to do you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
it's great while they're really little but as they get older and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different
he goes to a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do and so they get the socialization with other kids and not really school but a different authority than mom once in a while kind of learning how to deal with society and they need that to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day I think they do too
and I need it for the break that's the other thing they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work still taking care of the children is a very important job
and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and if it's not mom then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
and enjoy it that's the whole thing
I think that's the thing that we're going to see I think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time
because if I had been allowed to work maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week I might still be working basically full time or part time if there had been some way to work it out
because I liked my job really well
but I was just pulled in so many different directions it was just driving me crazy and now with the photography it's working that's what I'm doing is working part time because I can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the week and use those hours to do
the thing that I'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and different stuff like that
so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband when he's at home can take care of them so jobs have to become more flexible
I think they're really going to have to and not just for mothers for fathers as well
it's going to have to be both so that's another thing that has to adapt is the father's attitudes about whose job is this
it's his job too and I to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to so
it's just convincing your husband that that's important or that it's important enough for him to do it just con
because if he saw mom doing only that all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it that I should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it and you you talk
I know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something to help and even though we were both working the same number of hours and doing things I had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done
this is what you do it now and a man might say out loud I understand this and I agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him
and and that's a very hard attitude to change
and it's just they don't look at things most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it
they just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down and in a while get around to it and I think most women walk in and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this taken care of instead of having someone say this is the time this needs to be done
but and a lot of that is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in the right ideas to so that they know that male and female are both responsible for doing this that's right and
and I think that's going to show up a lot more now in the next generation of boys and girls the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there
they were both working at whatever things needed to be done
they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be clean
but I think in between we got a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility
and it's going to and I think that's happened in a lot of cases
some kids are really having it if they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and young college some time day care is really good
but sometimes it's baby sitting
it's someone keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say here's what's right
and here's what wrong and here's what we expect of you
I think that was one of the main reasons that I quit was because I wanted my kids to have my values and I felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little
this is the way I feel about this and this is the way because that if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you add onto it as they get older
but if no one does anything when they're little then it's twice as hard as they get older I'm saying this as I'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something
I understand I wait until I put mine in bed before I make my calls she's usually in bed by this time but she's staying up late tonight but I want to have a relationship with her my dad was a very traditional dad and when I was a child I didn't really know my dad very well and I miss that and I want
that's the thing like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too but men have to be convinced of that
and a lot of it's for the better some of the women's roles are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work but I think if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like you're taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often I know mine almost never did do you have a pet?
I have two cats and do and two fish two cats you're lucky your two fish
and what do you have? my husband you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing
my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog so we have a black labrador
beautiful gorgeous black labrador but to me he belongs up in the farm
does he sleep in your house? and
because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day but this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he's comes from a purebred line and there's nothing you could say bad about him except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle
and this is huge course when he runs around the yard he just digs he doesn't know that he's tearing up things but he does
and the worst part that I had with him was when he was about eight months old
and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour and I came home and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
and it was in the floor and I just about lost it and I called and I said come home and get your dog and so he said puppies just chew when they're nervous and I wish you had told me
and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum he kept picking at it and I didn't the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it so the last thing he did was when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch and I told my husband I said it's either me or the dog and he looked at me
he loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him and he's a good dog so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic I thought do I have a pet
but I grew up with cats and I'm very comfortable I love my cats
I had one cat for eighteen years I got her when I lived in hawaii before I even got married I had my cat she's old
I had to have her put to sleep last june isn't she? I started to say then you broke your heart
it was awful it was just awful
and she just sat there on my lap
she just waited and bless your heart
it was awful that makes me feel so bad
but her hair but the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband's shoes
and she just liked his shoes and he'd have these hundred dollar shoes it was just bad
and my closet and it was something that's awful I never heard of that before
it was terrible and once she did it then she wouldn't if our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husband's shoes she must have known he didn't like her or something or the smell or something
I and I would bar the closet doors and would clean the carpets and
it was just awful does your cat sleep in the house?
that was very funny they are house cats
I have two cats right now and of course
they sleep with my kids my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat
but the cat doesn't destruct does it? it doesn't do anything
I'm not going to have a dog
we've had two dogs and they both got ran over after we had them for several years just nice little outside dogs but
were just my kids friends they would go with me when I would go running and the last one got hit as she was following one of my sons across the road to the school
it was awful it was just that is
and it's too heartbreaking but they do dig up and they just wreck things and I'm not a dog person they do wreck things I'm not either
I'm not either and it's just been I wouldn't want a lab it sounds beautiful but he's beautiful but it's just one of those concessions I just had to make
but I kind of ignore him today's the first cold we've had in texas and it's really cold and drizzly and it's freezing
and people are doing their fires and I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square and he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me I won't make any trouble and then my daughters both have hamsters and I and how old are your girls? they're eleven and eight and I gave in at christmas
and they keep their cages real clean it always smells of cedar and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and
I think they're cutting us off that's
somebody's trying to cut in on my line and I don't want to answer I'll just wait
I've got incoming calls and I don't know why body's calling
I hate to cut it off I think they would cut us off I understand so we'll just wait whoever it is will call back they'll cut us off pretty soon
it's somebody calling for my kids I know actually it's my son I know it is
my older boy he never likes to come home from school anyway that's what we have and I've tried to start a fish tank how does and I keep losing all my fish in the salt water? salt water or just regular water
the types of vacations that I usually take I usually come back more tired after my vacation then I do before I take it
I need to definitely take a vacation where all I do is rest and I guess to do that I'd probably have to take it at home
but the vacation spots that I like to go to are places like the bahamas and florida I enjoy the beach
after our last summer's vacation I am antibeach antibeach
we went to cape hatteras
we were out visiting one of our kids in maryland and we went down to cape hatteras for a few days
and the waves were huge I've never quite seen waves like this one
and I was standing in water not more than barely above my ankles
and when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles
and I was standing there talking to my daughter and this really big wave came and totally threw me and one foot did not come out of the sand and it tore the ligaments in my knee
so I'm never going to another beach again ever I'm you might be like I am I enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas but I really don't like to get in the ocean I prefer a swimming pool
I love to go and play around at least I always did although actually I like the mountains I don't really like hot weather
that's my biggest gripe about living here
and I basically don't want to go to a hot place on vacation I can understand that
my dream vacation is alaska this is just someplace I've always wanted to go that would be nice
and someday we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there I know I've taken several vacations to colorado and I used to live in colorado sometime ago for a couple of years and I really enjoyed that
I'd like that I haven't been to yellowstone for a long long time
and we've been talking about going there next summer I don't know we'll have to I've never been up to the yellowstone area so
it's been a long time but it seems when your family is different places a lot of trips involved going to visit that's right that's right you got that
I'm we usually go up to wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from
and my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here
and we've got one of our kids lives out on the east coast and so we have to go to those you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then
I know but I'm tired of them I want to go someplace different up there that's right
my idea of the ideal vacation would be to begin with money be no object so just absolutely first class fly where I want to rent a car if I want to and not worry if somebody says let's take this little side trip and not have to sit there and figure out again we fit that in there or not
and that's what I would like to do I have no interest for example in taking a cruise to me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling it would be sort of I feel like it would be confining
I would much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself
I just that does absolutely nothing for me
but I don't know I can say that I think my favorite spots are still to go where there's mountains and a lot of trees and wildlife to view and I like that kind of stuff I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery
I agree I can do that too and I think if I had the money I would probably go to europe every year
because I think that they have it all over there in two miles
there's mountains and there's beaches and it's all right there so
I guess I've never really thought about it that way our we have a daughter who's almost thirteen but she's a very picky eater
and our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is holly would starve to death if we took her into the country
but I would like if it was anywhere in the world to go I would like to go to africa
I my children as a matter of fact are all grown now so I am assisting them with their children in their selections
so my children are grown but they're teenagers
so I have three children ages fifteen seventeen and twenty
and I guess about when the youngest one was in kindergarten I started working at a preschool and doing some work
and then I took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool so I am in the child care environment so
I myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment than the one on one care is
when my children were growing up up and until they were in the preschool situation I had them in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids and I felt like that home environment was very important to them
it was important to me
and I feel that they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age it is
however in today's environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that's the way our young people are dealt with
in other words there're more people they're dealt with in packages
that's an interesting point of view I seeing the children in the school the way I do we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides for the under three year olds
but still they have an opportunity to be with other children
and it is true but as far as looking for a place I think it's very important to have very caring people to take care of the without a doubt in a school if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers you're going to need really
I recently stopped by mcdonalds and I was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was going to accomplish all of these things
however when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal it is
and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment that's right that maybe
that maybe have another salary in their family where they can do that
and that's what I had the opportunity of doing
and I could concentrate on the creativity and really having a lot of fun with the children and providing them with a great atmosphere
they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that they pay
they are to be there ahead of time they're there early to receive the kids and they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning
that's right which is
and then they have to work until the place closes at six p m and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they don't have cleaning crews in most of those
that's true that's true
and she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary
and she because people can't pay to provide and
ours is a church and so we don't have the expenses of a building
we share the expense with the church but we don't have enough
taking care of a whole building and that responsibility
so it is a lot different
I know that when my youngsters were small my older son was adopted so he went into child care at two weeks
and my younger son went into child care at six weeks
so they were in that environment actually up until they became seven and nine
and at that point I said they have been given the custodial care that they need and the after hours care has been as good a quality as I can provide for them however they're going out into the school environment now they're under a lot of other influences I need to be here for them I need to be involved in their school because I want to be the one who influences the way they develop
so I quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that I could help direct their learning experiences and their development you did?
I felt that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them
but when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that they're going to need to interact with other people I felt like I needed some strong influence there
so I well that's different than most people do it a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school I know that's right once they get up in but
I just felt very strongly about that and I did not work as a matter of fact my son was in the second grade and when he started at skyline high school I asked him son where do I go to sign up for the p t a? and he said mom don't do that to me
don't do that to me so I knew it was time to go back to work
but I feel very good about spending those years with my boys that's true
and I was just really grateful I only had one bad child care experience it was in a home the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it she was from argentina
and she was going back home and I couldn't just wait for three or four months and then bring them back to her
so I had to find a new place
and I put them in this home the kids cried when I took them I could hear the kids crying when I went to pick them up
they were always cranky and irritable
so I just took off and went there one day and the children were left unattended in a room they were not well cared for how awful
so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place
but that's the only bad experience I had the rest of the time they stayed in la petite academy
and I was very pleased with their development and their progress
they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn but they're going to learn it sometime for the most part they did have good care
and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the y and taught to swim which just pleased me to death because I've always been afraid of the water
however my older son came home and he said mom I don't like that man said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me I had to get my face wet or I'd never swim
it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school and relay that to them
and well she said kids do exaggerate but she said let's go ahead and send him another day or two days and I promise you faithfully I will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what's happening
what do you think about it?
the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so
I think a lot of it has to do with women working I do too I think it's going to in the future I think all women are going to work
they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby but that will be it
or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you just continue right on with your work
it really is coming to that because most women now days can not afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them
they can't even afford to take off to have children it seems like
and it seems if you're going to have kids that society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it
because if you have two if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three
I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when I had them and when they were small until my youngest got in junior high I didn't have to work
that is good I didn't work I needed to but I didn't
steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in march and she doesn't have to work either I don't know how they do it I don't know how people do it with one let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you
obviously we don't have any and I think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married and not have kids
and I think society for such a long time said you're married now you need to have your family and I don't think it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family
and it's getting where if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two
and it's hard with two we my youngest one I have two I have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon
and if I had a third one I just don't know where it would come from
because I work now I work full time and it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot
just the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous absolutely outrageous
I know I know and they're getting worse my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for one of her next classes and it was ninety six dollars
and this book is a little bitty skinny book
I said is it lined in gold
but it's getting worse and if I'd of probably had three or four children I don't see how we could have made it without me working
but that's probably because if you had three you would say if I'd of had four I guess it's always not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine but I think I would have had to work
if I'd of had that many I'd of had to work in order for my kids to even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up I would have had to work
but I think it's getting more and more like when you have one child that's it then you go to work and you work
because if you have two or three kids by the way the inflation's going I think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing there isn't going to be any of this very few people will ever stay home
and that's all right with me because I don't want to stay home
I think I'm just part of the new stuff that is just I think I would just go nuts sitting at home all day long I can't imagine how I did because now I work all the time
and I work all week and I can't imagine how I stayed home
I think to myself what did I do and I think it revolutionized where a woman thinks that a way just like my daughter there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job and then when everything's set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but it is so far down the road
when I graduated high school the thing
that's what you did and then you got married and then you had a family
that's just the way it was
and that's like when my I know when my mother's age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an
I like the way it is
it's being we're from houston and so it's not so hard for people you've been married three or so years and you don't have kids it's okay nobody does but you come to a place like belton and a lot of the kids here get married out of high school
it's real small town and and a lot of people in our we're the only couple in our sunday school class except for one other couple who are in their forties who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and I'm going there's life in there that's
not everybody has to have kids and I'd rather spend the time with my husband than spending time it's your turn but you know that now even whenever I was coming up and everything and we got married right out of high school a year after I got out of high school
and I didn't have kids for four and a half years but that was because I wanted to work and I wasn't ready for kids
I think that's what it is I'm not either and everybody thought what is the matter with her
they're probably going I bet she can't get pregnant they thought that it was terrible and then when I'd tell them I'm just not ready for children yet but that you better just get ready now
you don't just get ready but I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year
and I just was not ready for kids I wanted to get out and work a little bit and I wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have I don't care what anybody tells you
and I think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way because that's like my daughter she says that maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then
and even though I'd like to have grandchildren I can see her point
steve's mom finally said that god will take care of us when it's our time
she finally told me it's okay if you don't but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family
and she stayed home and raised her kids and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives to be the housewife and have dinner ready by five and be there at every beck and call and I was raised totally opposite how we got together I don't know because my mother had six girls and she worked too
and I guess I just and I saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard and and it really is I know just like now there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries it really does accept for what we give to my daughter to put her through college and stuff
but the rest of it we just buy things like boats or we go on trips or just the more or less like entertainment stuff but
I think you've earned that though I feel like I have because we're just a age now I'm not old but I'm older
and I got to stay home with my kids which I really wanted to do but now I could not go back and do it
I really couldn't I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing and I did stuff but to me it feels like I must have done nothing
and I think it's just the new way that people are thinking I think so but
I think it would be neat if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you more and more of them are I don't know if it is up there where you are but where I am just all the hospitals they're getting day care
are they? but the reason they had to do this was because so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go
more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals
I don't know if the t I in dallas does or not I know nobody around here does it it's too small around here
I almost forgot the topic I was waiting so long for it to find somebody
it's on your favorite t v shows and why what is your favorite t v show?
major dad you like that one?
I love it I think it promotes good family values and it's funny I've never really watched that one it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows
that's and there's only a few that I like to watch routinely
what kind do you like to watch? probably my favorite is I like shows like growing pains and what's the other one they moved from tuesday night to wednesday night so I don't get to watch it very much
wonder years? wonder years that's my favorite
I like both of those real much also I think basically they promote family values wonder years I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever I guess I can really relate to it and it's just a real cute show I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of honesty or sort of a purity value
I do too I don't like it uh lot of the shows that I've liked in the past like golden girls and some of them tend to get so risque and when you have children watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me
and that's one of the reasons if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was little house on the prairie my wife really likes that show
which I always felt was wonderful
and so many of them nowadays like I said are just
they go after they like I said the risque stuff just I guess they think that's what people want to watch there was but there's a sense of purity in the show one of my favorite shows used to be happy days
but richie always used to be just so honest and pure
and when he left the show it seemed to be missing that part of it
and I never did like it after that
so I don't know I see the same thing in wonder years and a lot of the shows that I like to watch there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere
I agree do you like the sports programming?
I enjoy those also almost as much to a certain extent I'm our whole house is baseball fans
and we enjoy that and so you're going to watch a game tonight?
so do you have a favorite for the series or anything?
probably the pirates but only because of steve bushel
otherwise I really don't care that much but I'm annoyed that the rangers got rid of him and I'd like to see him do well all the way to the bank I guess he's a nice guy I take it you live in the dallas area
do you live in the dallas area?
live in plano I live in garland and I like steve bushel but I don't really like the pirates I'm a big saint louis cardinals fan
so I'm kind of pulling for the braves over all they've come from so far down
I really would like to see them do well
it's so I keep hoping the rangers are going to do one year they maybe they'll make it I don't know
but I like sports programming quite a bit but I guess my favorite shows are the and getting back to the point that you made that's really true we were watching roseanne couple of weeks ago and her daughter was talking about birth control
and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time and she's only seven years old so
it's so many of them now it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in and I'm an adult
and I have adult tastes now but I don't need that
I like things that are wholesome that seems to be more our values too the wonder years it's kind of risque stuff maybe for teenagers and you can kind of relate to it
I don't know that's I enjoy that a lot
but I agree with you the and it's funny because the shows a lot of them that used to be considered risque like three's company and stuff I think they maintained people would watch them because there was really the period that was going on there he really wasn't messing around with the girls but everybody perceived him that way and stuff
but as soon as he went to move in with another girl the show just died
and it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
with credit cards me I try to get maybe just one or two I don't like having credit cards for every store I just don't like them what are you afraid of with them? what am I afraid of?
I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much I just don't think that I need them I they are tempting at times
but sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me so
that can be very very true and everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money so
that's the idea they figure that if they give you card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
and that's right they make money off of it whether you use it or not
the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you would be paying interest that's right
I use mine a great deal for groceries for everything that I can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing that's what I do
that's what I do just a second
that's all right sounds like you have a little one there I have two little ones you have so
how old are they? four and two and half
those are two very active ages so I'm like you I only use my credit card for when I I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month
do you ever use the a t m machines? I never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but I take the checkbook so if I need cash I just tell him and he gets it out and I don't even think I know my number
I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash
that's right he couldn't do without it since he can just do it right there at work for nothing that helps
the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on you're right and that's kind of silly
because they figure that that's correct you're defeating the purpose
the idea is to use their money
and during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month
I get at least one or two a week people sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it because I
I think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted it's like I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line
you've already been preapproved
preapproved that's their favorite word everybody in the country is preapproved I think
I think so you're right
it's interesting that people have generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go
and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that one day they find I didn't realize I'd spent this much money that much stuff
and then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it
and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own
and that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem it does because you're just costing yourself more money because if you can't make the monthly minimum payment you're paying interest again that's right so that's right so
it's been enjoyable talking with you it's enjoyable seeing that somebody feels the same way so
take good care take care of your little ones you too good luck
national health insurance is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive
because the articles that I've read regarding national health service in canada and england has indicated that what stay in line for four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor
I'm sort of mixed on this I think that the answer may lie not in so much a national kind of medical thing like england has but more of a national insurance sort of clearinghouse or whatever I think that too many the problem right now is that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through and I think you mentioned canada I think that they have a system where the government deals with you go to whoever you want but file through one particular setup I see
and that way they are able to reduce prices because it's all one centralized thing I think that again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own if you don't have a company picking up the major portion of your health insurance the cost is almost prohibitive
I was listening on the radio the other day and they were talking that something like this I think they were talking about the fact that the money that could be saved in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider could they could make it provide health insurance to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save we're currently where I'm working now under blue cross
I don't know what the total cost of the program is but for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a month or something like that
so I assume that probably the total cost is probably three fifty to four hundred they're probably picking up about half of it
and that's a pretty good policy but if you had something like one of these health maintenance programs
or one of whatever the type name is h m o where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest if you tried to buy something like that it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something h m o
and they're fairly expensive I was on an h m o up until last year through work
and it was I forget how much I paid a month but it is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care
and the reason I quite was not because I didn't like it I really kind of did the reason I quite was just because a certain doctor that we enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that h m o so my wife decided she wanted to stay with that doctor
so we went to the medical insurance that we have here at work
and I like the convenience of the h m o in a certain respect because it once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem a lot of people complain saying I don't want to have to be told who I need to go to but if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference if you find someone you really like that's right
and then we did find several good doctors and like you say it's five dollars an office visit and my wife was in the hospital had our daughter and I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars for everything
that included the doctors the time the hospital everything delivery room and everything delivery room and everything
including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay but that was still included in that cost so
it's really nice because their attitude is different than in a h m o they're trying to prevent a problem by keeping the cost down at the front end and have you come in
they charge five dollars a pop you're more willing to go in and try to take care of a problem before it grows big as to a company's benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job
because they don't have to worry about going in and paying seventy five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes that's a
I really liked it my wife and I both did you don't have to worry about filling out forms for reimbursement and all or getting paid eight percent of whatever you just pay the five dollars right then and then you're done with it but here again the doctor's practices in hospitals have become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now
you take a hospital the physical plant itself you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building when the rooms are empty
so they spread the costs out over all the patient costs and that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and it being a four thousand dollar bill
they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay
they get a lot of people who just have to be there and can't afford it and so they know they're not going to get money from them
so they have to absorb it somewhere else
my daughter and son in law had a baby here about what he'll be three in august
and their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital
and she went in she had the baby and she was out in two days time
and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital
the deductibles didn't apply
and so that's one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by if you'll shorten your stay then we will waive the deductible
our insurance is doing something similar where they're also going to
being a former drug user I guess I have to say at this point that I do approve of it
because I know that in using drugs I was not a good employee
and so I can see from the company's standpoint that there whenever you are an employee of the company you are using its assets you are also under their liability under the workmen's comp
on my job we had a lot of workmen's comp cases and I work for a tire company modern tire where do you work?
and it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our injuries occur
and what we do is we'll have a drug test if a man has an accident then he's automatically given a drug test
do they do it within hours of the accident or is it? when he goes to the doctor the first time
and so that kind of I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have just started using it for the past year or so
we've let some people go that we found that drugs were used in their system I don't know how t e c would handle it they haven't pursued it
if there's some problem I know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines and he went to a separate drug testing firm
and they showed it negative
so I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried
I think that's probably true too that's sort of scary and then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine
and he tested positive on cocaine you always wonder is he just saying that
that's a bad situation I think most companies now as far as entry exams require that I think they should
I'm a t I employee and I'm really gung ho for it
in fact I some of the places now like I b m don't allow them smoking in the plant
we have designated smoking areas
but I work in sort of a building that's not really it's on the campus of the t I facility but it's a little bit separated we lease the building and it's a factory environment
and they have designated smoking but it's just wide open it's not ventilated properly
and I think that's bad but as far as the drugs being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's essential
because you're endangering everybody's lives if it's something like that
in fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years
and I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to come up
they never called me they never and finally the day we declared war was my time you're kidding
and my boss has gone for about three times I think and I told him he's obviously in a high risk group the executives?
and of course they did specifically single them out when we started that they were going to do all them first the executives?
wouldn't that be awful if you were using and lose your job and everything which I thought was interesting
I can't believe I was so brazen before like I say I'm a former drug user
but I accepted christ as my lord and savior and so I don't use drugs any more
what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind? marijuana cocaine and amphetamines and all on the job too
it had gotten that bad
it's really lucky that you got away from that
cause that's really downward spiral it's life is so much more enjoyable
and I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job
that's it there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
just life in general that's right
I'm definitely for it
plus you want to think that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life that's right in some cases
my husband several years back worked for motorola
and they had it was a chemical handling type
and they have some serious chemicals out there
they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water that kind of thing
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals
and that's really frightening
so I think some places like that it should be mandatory on a greater frequency than maybe just paper pushers like I am I would think there would be
you'd think so but but they weren't? I don't know if they do it till yet isn't that awful
because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was even before they had the designated smoking type stuff at t I
I forgot what I guess it was eighty four eighty five something like that
and at that time they had no testing whatsoever
so that's scary that reminds me of I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
and I just went where?
should we move? let me move as far away as possible
that's awful but I'm proud though that I grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular
but people have really become wise about drugs
and they really have a good campaign for the young people
they know it's not smart so I guess it was just a generational thing
peer group is the other way now instead of that's right and that's good
that's that's the best way to stop it
it really is I think we did it
it's good talking to you
I enjoyed talking to you cathy
what do you think about child care
my feelings on it is I wouldn't take a child to day care you know?
I'd wind up just a baby sitter in a home probably find someone how come you wouldn't take them to a day care? just because of the
too many kids and too many infections and things coming in they seem to pass a lot of
sicknesses and I don't know then all the things you hear about them you kind of wonder whether or not
I'm sure there's some good ones but I just I don't think that I would I took cammy to a it was a preschool day care type of thing
but I liked it some ways and some ways I didn't I think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important and
how was it? I think they had two teachers and I think there were twenty kids but I only had her going two days and most of the other kids were going more days so that was probably my own fault that she didn't
she went one thing I noticed is just they were trying to teach her to write her name and I didn't notice it until this summer when I was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way not in a natural form
she did? and I was kind of mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or tried to say look you're holding your she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff but she was
wrapping her arm all the way around
and I hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point she was four or three it was last year and then this summer I got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on and I like I said I didn't notice it till then because I hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that
they'd never picked it out though? they never
or just never said anything course like I said I took her two days a week and maybe that was my main reason for taking her was just social skills more than anything else
I felt she needed the just I didn't feel like she was mature enough socially and
one thing that's kind of different too though a preschool than taking a infant at a day care where they're taken care of
I think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know preschool's a different thing but I think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know unless you have awfully good references reliable people
I don't know it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long
I think it's hard to leave them it is it is the older ones it's not you don't even really have any real worries because you know that they'll play with whoever's there and they usually adapt pretty well but
it is just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will and you know kind of their schedules and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal
I don't know how people that have young kids working work full time and do it really without being stressed out all the time I think it's I don't know then on the other hand I think it's harder to stay home in some regards it's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive and at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess and you haven't got anything done and
what am I going to fix for supper
it is it's kind of hard to always feel is this important what I'm doing and the work never ends
that's for sure it doesn't so
but I think probably people that take them to preschools and day cares full time they would probably just feel different I just think it would be hard to do that full time I feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the baby sitter crazy and
or is everything okay you
do you have any pets? we got two cats
two cats and my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies
so I'm used to having cats around I like them
I like having pets around in general I favor dogs over cats actually but I'm not a dog person at all
I'm a dog person I had I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid? probably I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid in fact I may still be we
but not cats that I wonder sometimes
but we house sat for my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and he has a dog and everything we were sitting the dog and everything and I felt just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until sunday it was maybe you're still allergic to the dog it was that could be it
the thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek of the dogs and constantly
dogs are real high maintenances you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it's not quite the same thing
that's true and it's just nice that cats you don't have to let them outside all cats are indoor cats
so you're not worried about them running all around the neighborhood and they make their mess in the cat pan which is
limited it's a pain to clean but we used to they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats pans they didn't
when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and use this thing to take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible but now you get these liners that is garbage bags and you the
that sounds so easy what I did the cats do it in there you pull it and take it out and throw it away and that's it
I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis
and what we used to do was just put newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing same idea
then I would do it everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very very rarely everyday?
and so it wasn't so bad I see
two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there because if I put a lot one of the cats would have been
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted
I that true she's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him
it was her ex boyfriend and just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was and she's stuck with it
and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it so you know so you don't have anything right now?
we don't have anything right now except the kid that's
now we have a kid but he was completely against having a dog or cat he said they're as much work as a kid and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend and I don't know because the cats pretty much we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out
and it's not a big deal really they're happier when we're around but they're pretty much okay by themselves and we couldn't do that with a dog
that's really true but other friends of mine have cats they have four of them and if they go away they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats they're so used to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset that's pampering the petals
and they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that
I figured something having so I tried to have a goldfish
and I killed that one within a very short amount of time but they're not that much fun you can't take them for a walk you can't they can't fetch
they can't do anything so I've never I think we had fish when I was a kid but I don't
my brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that and one of his fish jumped out of the fish tank and fried itself on the radiator behind the dresser I'll never forget that because I remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish
and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on the radiator behind
it was not gross I didn't see it but got them
trying to remember we had a dog for a while and I don't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now
but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish
and you like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have it's like I don't know I just never understood what the attraction they're pretty and everything but I've just never seen the attraction of having fish it's not as much fun
a friend of mine had an eel an eel?
and then he had a I forget what type of fish it was it was one of these fish that it ate a big other fish and things like that there would be sort of moby fish in a tank now we really get sick
and it I couldn't see having fish like that
I could see having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty but I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha and used to drop mice in these aren't cats this is gross
that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them
I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and your things destroyed the mice
but a cat will do the same trick let's see I had a pet rat for a while
and it was a live rat and this woman just offered it to me while I was in graduate school and she was actually a very fun pet I had a friend in college who had a pet rat for a while
I forget how she got it but it was the same kind of a deal I think she got it I think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department
mine had been a how did this work a mill rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick and she said I don't think he's sick I think she's pregnant
and they had misclassed the sex of back there and so she asked me if I want one of those babies and I took the baby and I got her when she was just this tiniest little thing like half the price of a mouse
and then she grew to be I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big a pound or something
I don't know how much and I had her for over two years and she was very affectionate she would crawl on me and she would sit on my neck or my shoulder while I was working and things like that much more than you would think
if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts so
and rats are not my favorite animals in the world but I could see getting one from birth and everything
sort of weird for me to have had one too but there it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage and it was easy to take care of
but I have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they tell me the same thing
I just again it gets into vivant much fun what I guess they can be I
actually it was more fun than you would think starting from the beginning but we also live in the city now actually in manhattan
and so it's almost impossible to it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly not a dog people do people
but it's not I don't plus the pooper scooper one new york so
you see all these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them it's really kind of funny I was living in northern jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it
we were wondering if they had any special law for the horses in central park
they don't I should make you of course not
they have the bags behind them but I think they're actually supposed to keep them clean hit the bags
but I can't even walk by central park when summertime just the smell is so bad of the horses I haven't been up there last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad
it's not that long ago it was twelve times of the year not this past fall but fall a few years
it was almost october of eighty five
I think was the last time I was up there and at center park
I had a friend who went to colombia and I used to go up and visit her so
that's not too far from were we live you said you had two cats are they breed cats or anything or are they just they're just mutts
my wife got them from uh friend of hers at work and everything as kittens
and this was before we even met she's had them for a couple years and they're really cute they're sisters
one of them is a lot bigger than the other one and she pushes the other one away from the food apparently I don't know all the details but they were born around christmas because one of them is named tinsel and the other one is named holly the
they're both females? both females they're both spayed or neutered
and they're both declawed at least on the front claws
robert what substances do you think are the most likely causes of air pollution?
I don't I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that
so I believe them but I'm not a chemist do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial areas factories and so on?
I don't really know I grew up in los angeles and have felt like I was victimized by air pollution I was going to say so you understand smog
I understand it very well and in fact I was a private pilot there
and I can remember etched clearly in my mind flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and really being unbelieving at what looked like a
it just looked liked peanut butter thick and brown and so on and that was a few years ago?
this was quite a few years ago this was in the nineteen sixties I wonder if it's any better now because california has such strict rules about emissions and so on people say that it is somewhat better
I don't know if you heard about the recent legislation in colorado against a power company that's actually on indian land I believe but it has been ruled against regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the grand canyon and particularly in the winter months
so they it was a landmark case because it's unusual to I can they were talking about shutting it down if it didn't comply and so on
did it burn coal? I don't know that the information is one of those wire services kind of pieces of news so it's hard I never did see the full story so I don't know
but they said that it really caused so much smog over the grand canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the piloting the helicopter trips and that sort of thing which would be horrible because there's nothing
that's such a spectacle it would be a shame to ruin it
what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem
I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals maybe just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing
apart from that I don't know what we can do as individuals what do you think we can do? you think it's more to society I guess I kind of agree there I on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can force government that we elect to deal more seriously with it
and I do think that we have a responsibility there I must admit I'm not always real politically active but I do think that congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards
and it's brought the they really listen to the lobbyist and the car manufacturing companies have really pushed they all those restrictions are really too hard we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution
so I suspect that that's one thing that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators but as a society I think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it being individually responsible in order to be group responsible
I guess I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless there's something economically justifiable about it
and in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to get rid of the source of it
I suspect that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure come to bear on the companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen is for governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't
and I don't know how long that will take
people also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it so if you don't want to burn coal for power how about nuclear energy
we don't want that either
how about investing in the sun nobody wants to pay twenty five cents a kilowatt hour I don't think
I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it it's just the same thing with the gasoline now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't run into the kind of problems we recently had
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent and they don't want to pay for it so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war
however it might have had other causes certainly oil was a big factor
and I think that's probably going to happen with such things as air pollution when we get serious about our motors in our automobiles then maybe we'll have a little bit of help
do you have any air pollution in your area?
there's not really a lot here in raleigh once in a while we'll get some I think it kind of washes down from your area linda
that's what they you're talking about from the middle states that have more factories and so on
that's what they say but it's not very usual and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities we really don't have that either although I think I can tell a difference in I lived in this area for about twenty five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level particularly in the summer when it gets hot and you have that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air usually caused by exhaust
it seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable and my eyes sting more and so on and so on so I suspect that it's an ever growing problem
I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here
I think we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch it was nice talking to you
and I enjoyed the conversation so did I what are your favorite shows?
it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much t v but the ones that are out now
I've watched that sisters a couple of times I think that's kind of a good show I've never seen that haven't you?
I like that one and I'm trying to think I don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch
how about you? I like l a law not because it's realistic but it's entertaining I do like that
occasionally I'll see that one let's see I watch cheers sometimes and mostly just movies when there's a good movie on do you?
when there isn't a good movie on too
I just like to have the t v on if I'm home alone or something
have either the radio or the t v s got to be on the whole time
I do I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately
I've been home with a I have a baby and so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much
so I'll watch a soap occasionally
do you watch any of those? I don't because I work all day
but I I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days around christmas or whatever after a while I'll start watching it
and then on for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened
and then I'll just forget it
what ones do you get into? I don't even remember the last time I watched was back in college it was general hospital or something
and I maybe watched it for a week
but I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera how funny it was a
I don't get into them that much
when I'm home sometimes in the day I'll watch them
but I was really trying to think I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch or else you said you have kids how old?
I have a six year old and I have a he'll be a year old in january so you aren't a sesame street fan? they watch it
my six year old's kind of he's outgrown that one a little bit but I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby
and he's entertained by it
so I do watch that one supposed to be a great babysitter
they're not entertained for too long with it he's still too little but I do turn that on
and I do like donahue sometimes I watch that I think he has some interesting things on it I know what time is that on I never see it?
it's on at four I'm not home then that's why I don't see it
I'll watch that occasionally he's got some real I don't know there's some real weird people that he seems to come up with isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange?
he does have some real bizarre things I think so other than that I don't know what's that?
guess I'm not much of a t v person really I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us but tell me is it snowing up there?
it snowed a little bit probably about four days ago
and they said we weren't going to get any more for christmas but do you have snow on the ground now?
there is snow on the ground that's nice
I wish it would snow a little bit more I've heard it's raining there we've broken all sorts of records
they've got we still have some highways closed and it stopped raining almost twenty four hours ago
but just phenomenal I you see it on the news all the time but until you've really seen it it doesn't really hit you
but I was driving home from work friday and I saw there were some stop signs submerged up to the writing on the stop sign and that was just
it was amazing to me
so there has been some flooding and there's been a lot
it's too bad but the thing is that this happens in the last three years it's happened at least once a year if not twice but the people continue to move back in the flood zones
so I don't know you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for
I don't think I would
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood what a mess
do you work for t I? I do
this has been an interesting thing to do have you made a lot of calls or
I've probably talked maybe to five people
my husband is doing it too and he's talked to a few more than me
but it's been real interesting and kind of fun do you get paid for these?
five dollars five dollars a call?
I wish I could do that
don't you have to do it as part of its we can't get paid for it don't you have to do it
do you want to go first?
I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic fitness and exercise
why don't you go first I like to do weight training and cycling and just walking swimming I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall and the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore so I had to kind of change my life style a little bit
let me ask a personal question how old are you? thirty eight
then you should over thirty five everything goes downhill the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to
you're lucky then because I've battled arthritis all my life
even since I was about two or three
then they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and I do water aerobics religiously do water aerobics I bet that helps
I used to do it about six times a week and now I'm down to about four but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in there I tried weight training and I'm telling you I just can't lift the things
and the shock on the system is just too much so I have stuck to water aerobics basically the weightless thing and trying to keep this shape that way
but it's hard to find it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way to get in shape without having to spend anything that's right that's right or it's the geriatric crowd that's right
so I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do
but you have to have an indoor pool this is true
so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water that
that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training and that does look very odd in the water I can believe that have you tried the pool at the spring creek fitness center?
and that's the only place I haven't tried and people have told me that's the texins facility? I have been told that thing is just lovely it is they keep it at eighty one degrees year round
do you use that facility a lot? a fairly good amount more on the weekends I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings I try to come down to the dallas fitness center
do you know if they have child care there? have you done your attitude survey for this year yet? you need to put that on there seriously
they don't I don't work at t I you don't?
I used to work at t I
as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and I used to fill out those attitude surveys
and me and the insurance adjusters are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there
and I get my attitude expressed through them but I find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks this is true
and never having lived in texas before I starting working for t I and I came down here and they did an attitude survey six weeks after I had been working here and I asked about day care for the shift workers
and I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that it's not
it was not applicable to me and I was kind of horrified what year are we talking about?
we're talking nineteen seventy eight things have become much more enlightened since then
they couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages we still don't have a day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it
I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care
and the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was I had been rated number one in the field and then I took when I became pregnant I also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment could you hold the phone for one second I'm back
and then they used to and then I had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them back to back and of course to maintain and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because that's when I go into labor four and a half months and I don't even know it of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back
very easy very easy and they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a thirteen thousand dollar bill
but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work
and that was when they had it would have been the eighty five layoff
and I'll tell you how they handled this and I was just outraged I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and I went back and I said what the hell is going on here
and they told me your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway and we've got people here that really need to be working and so that we had just it was this way we didn't have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go and it took me about a year of arguing I said I've got to put this in writing to me because until they put it in writing I couldn't get my insurance benefits
and I couldn't get my termination benefits either there you go
I was just pissed as hell that they could do that I can believe that
but I guess things have gotten better I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things flex time is great
I still don't think after my experiences that they could get me to go back ever again I can understand I can understand it's been good talking with you
but let me ask you this since you use texans how much is it a month? it's only about ten bucks a month
that's for individual to add dependents is maybe another dollar or something it's no big deal that's it?
if you pay your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you're taking? you do for classes but to use any of the facilities is no extra charge that's cheap it is
that's really cheap do you have to be an active t I employee to join texans or a or a or a dependent of one
I am so dependent these days
it's a sense seen that my co dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor's fence
so my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but I think I'm going to go contact texans I really think I am
that beats any offer I've heard in a long time it's great
when you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell? it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends
I'd want to be there in the mornings from nine thirty to ten thirty I don't think that would be bad at all if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the dallas site
I'm actually right on the plano line then you could go either one
the spring creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more niceties amenities and you'd probably like the pool there
it sounds like I would I might do that then I learned something here I'm glad
you can go back to work now thank you thank you you have a good day
let's see what type of car do I want? I'd like to have a corvette
but my weekly wages don't apply for me to have that kind of car so
I'm engaged to get married so I'll more likely get a car for economic reasons
so to drive back and forth to work is all I'll need a car for pretty much and we have a truck so probably a economic size car or what kind of a car do you have now? right now I have a eighty seven cavalier it's a piece of
my car is really old too because I drive out of town a lot of the weekends
and I would like my next car to have good gas mileage
and same here a nice car american made and a nice car but not too expensive because I couldn't afford a brand new lamborghini
I hardly drive but while we're talking
while we're talking my next car I'd like to be sporty and nice
but it's expensive and then insurance is really high for that too so something that's not too sporty because of insurance then I know
that insurance does come into play I forgot about that
what kind of insurance do you have up there or is it real high up there?
mine just got lowered because I just turned twenty one and I'm not sure really how much I pay I just my mom's helping me out because I'm in college so I just give her the money and take her word for it
that insurance is high dollars it is so but
and the more expensive the car the higher it is so unless I win the lottery I won't be driving anything too expensive
I don't plan on buying a car for many many years so I have to make this one last as long as I can what's everybody drive up there?
in kenosha? in wisconsin they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive
it just is or do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything?
we have a jeep with four wheel drive because of the snow you mean or it never snows down here so
we don't have any snow here now
it all melted there is no snow at all we haven't had snow yet we usually only get once a year or so
kind of strange to you all?
it is because how it's seventy degrees here right now
don't tell me that how cold is it there?
actually it's been warm it's in the forties
and that's really warm
and it's supposed to rain tomorrow so we I've only seen snow once this year and it was really bad and then it all melted within the week
and now there is no snow so but what is your dream car?
I haven't really thought about it I'm not too big on cars I don't know the names and stuff but if I were to go to a car lot and look at them I would pick out one that looked really nice what's your favorite color? for a car?
probably blue if it was just an average middle class car blue?
but if I were to get a sports car maybe white or red
what kind of car do you drive right now?
it's a sky hawk buick
eighty three I think
eighty two thousand miles
I'm afraid it's not going to last me that long and I hope it does though
it's a two door I like smaller cars they're I find them more comfortable to drive does everybody have their windows tinted up there?
I don't see too many cars tinted everybody has tinted down here
I'm sure I could see why you been down here before? did you like it?
it was busy it's different I bet
it was nice I remember swimming on easter day and it was really cold up here but came back with a little tan
so that was nice it's like everybody freaks out when it I say arlington texas now because I talked one night to somebody in arlington virginia
and plano texas rather than plano illinois do they have one?
they do I didn't know that
I learned something already
let's see the three questions are what how much time do you spend with your children?
very little because they're grown what?
they're grown and gone mine is down at u t austin at college and the other one is in high school
so you do spend less time then?
because they almost don't want to know us they want to be with their friends how old are your kids? are they married or what?
I have two married and then two almost married and the other two I'm not sure two for sure are single
you have a lot of kids
between the spouse and myself we have six that's kind of nice though you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday? because I came with a split family and she had
there is so much of them are gone and they're doing their own things and a lot of times they've got when the holidays that's true
they have to see their other parent too and sometimes they want to do their own thing so sometimes it's just spouse and me I know
and you know what? what? sometimes that's okay I know because that's what my mother said one time
because who says that they just got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays
that's true and if they force them to that's not good either
that becomes a drudgery and let's see do they all live in the area?
of the six we've got four around here
we're talking north texas
and then one is in vermont montpelier montpelier vermont and the other one is in everett washington how did they end up so far away?
that's my little pair and my second marriage
and those are the youngest ones?
the the fourth and fifth child of the six are the two that are scattered like that
those are a long way
and they wanted to go how
j r my middle son fell in love with washington state
and the third daughter fell in love with vermont vermont so so they wanted to make their homes there
that's where they've gone to make their homes are those two married?
they just working up there or going to school or what?
let's see I guess you'd say j r is working trying to go to school
I wish to god he would go back they do especially if they're meant to I think
I certainly hope so I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at u t and I'm going to u t a right now myself so it's never too late
I agree it's never too late and especially in some of these schools around here I think they have about twenty percent older students
and when you're saying older we're talking fifty up I've seen some people that are really quite up there they look like in their very late sixties
and I say that's great why not
why not because that's a lot of times it's I believe that we in that category and I'm not in that category quite yet
but we are seasoned minds you're really ready to learn finally
I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen
it was it was a complete waste of money
settle down we know what we're wanting to study and we know our limitations we and
and we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether we don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning
at seven we're past that age
we're smarter now we know what we can do
so let's see so mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here
and so the second question forgot what the second question what was it what do the trends in families and do we approve what other families do
the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing that's right
but I'm seeing a change that government can't do it a change? I was going to say the same thing
schools are not able to
and between a person's religion their faith in their maker whether you're christian or jewish or whatever
and the family are going to have to solve some of the problem
those are the two that have the wherewithal and of course judeo christianity and of the jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the mission by the lord to do this very thing
so when another group of people step in try to do it they're tromping on our territory so to speak so
I firmly believe that
do you live in a home?
it's a house we bought about two and a half years ago now did you? first house we've lived in ours for about six years we had it built actually
and it's our first home too
so what do you think of owning a home as opposed to renting somebody else's? before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in
and that was quite an experience
I much prefer having my own home and just the space and more privacy
is it a fairly large house? it's twenty four fifty square feet
that's pretty good size it's a two story how about yours? it's tiny is it small?
it's not much bigger actually we had an two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is so
it's only eleven hundred square feet do you have children? just one just one
but all the rooms are small but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted and use an extra one for an office which is handy
I'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one I guess rather have lots of rooms and lots of space but that ends up costing me
how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood?
it's pretty typical it's a very very middle class neighborhood lots of young couples with I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes
and lots of kids and stuff and so it fits well in the neighborhood it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood but on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want
is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood
it seems about probably average or is it?
but our neighborhood has just a wide variety of people and there's older people here and people that are our age we're in our thirties
and there's a lot of kids people across the street have eight eight kids?
their home just burned down matter of fact last summer
and they're just rebuilding and their house is going to be really big it's
I'm sure with eight they're building a lot bigger he's not an obstetrician an orthopedic surgeon
so since the house did burn they're going it's quite different than it was before and it's a lot bigger
but ours is about it's a nice home it's definitely not one of the smaller ones and it's not the biggest either but
new ones they tend to be real tiny especially in newer neighborhoods my brother just built a new house he lives in wichita kansas and the neighborhood actually fought him on it because the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
that's because he's doing a lot of it himself for example landscaping and lots of the other stuff
and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood but they were pretty touchy on it you
he was a little surprised that's interesting you say that because we have those architectural codes here
and when we put out house in they wanted us to have there was one we have part siding on the two story part and then on the back
and there was one side where our chimney was and just the chimney was going to be brick and they wanted us to have more brick so we ended up having to go halfway up
it does look nicer and we would have like to have had all brick but of course at that point we couldn't afford it but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all
so it's kind of like they were
kind of depends on when they get in and so it was kind of like they ours is the last street that they built on so the houses actually on our street they're kind of gone a little bit nicer
they have it's gotten just they
it's the second phase
and so they've kind of changed the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any
my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they moved into a neighborhood and bought a real nice stone house down in south austin
and what the builder apparently plans to do is they do phase one and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled codes and stuff and then they come back in and then they sell
let me see what have you seen lately?
city slickers and star trek five five? only five?
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six didn't need to I found that out how about yourself? I just saw the latest one how is it? it was fantastic
I can't wait it's the lines in there were just perfect it was classic trek
does the old star trek guys meet the new guys?
it's just the old guys still it was just a rumor that that would happen this time however the rumor is that it will happen next time so
you know that I read in people or somewhere
that they said they weren't going to do anymore that was it
but except that the rumor is that they still might but it may not include the entire crew and it will be a next generation meets this generation
I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the old guys was I think it's a hundred years
somewhere in that range considering that spock was on couple weeks ago and that the very first episode of next generation they had mccoy that's right is that right? he was a doctor still? and
he was rear admiral whatever and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow vulcans age a lot better
he didn't look too bad did he? matter of fact he looks about as old and the next generation as he does in the latest star trek imagine that that's amazing
but did they have some pretty good special effects? excellent excellent special effects but I think the script was just incredible compared to the last one
the script was bad bad bad you know why?
I don't why? william shatner wrote it
is that right? and even worse he directed it
leonard nimoy he does a lot better in fact he didn't direct this one he produced this one but he directed the one before star trek four something like that
journey home I think that was
you're a real life trekkie? I think so
I really like them I wouldn't go so far as being a trekkie but
I've gone to one for real live trek convention but
I saw james doohan the guy that plays scotty
did you get to talk to him? it was crowded not in a crowd like that
it was want an autograph want to stand in line for about four hours
it was a pretty crowded place
they have some good management principals in this new generation I it's kind of funny I was reading in a book trying to think I can't quite remember the name of the book but it was saying don't do star trek management style and they were referring to captain kirk every time he left the enterprise everything went to hell
and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
so he kind of was a cowboy type too
made all the decisions but jean luke does more of a committee type of management
it's definitely a lot better a lot more realistic really
what other movies have you seen? saw the addams family last week
how was that? it was pretty good there were a few things different than the old series but on the whole it was pretty similar and a lot of fun
lots of little funny spots
did they have thing and in fact thing has a much bigger role than he does in the series there is lots of areas where thing saves the day
and he runs around a lot
how did I've always wondered how he gets around just finger hopping
but he's in a box? in fact it's funny he never does come in out of a box he was just kind of walking around didn't he used to? not really he was always in the box before that's okay
that's what I was thinking
we've got to talk about music
and do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind?
I guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because that's really when I grew up not a seventies baby
so that's really what I like better is that kind of music is it disco or is it like
not that kind of music but
more like rock like led zepplin type so they can get the doors and led zepplin that's cool
and how about the rolling stones?
I went to their concert last year when they were here that's when they toured how about pink floyd?
I like them so then we got some same things because
I just didn't know that much about music and I wasn't sure what kind of music it's very hard because in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen I listen to heavy metal or classic rock
what kind of heavy metal are we talking about? what we're talking about what they call hard rock
give me some examples like bad company what
bad company's not bad that's not they're like a c d c
a c d c why have you heard of them?
and stuff like that that's not really hard rock
I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal
I think when you say heavy metal I'm thinking about cinderella cinderella is hard rock heavy metal
I don't really care for cinderella but I like a c d c's okay but for example they have what but other bands consider it really hard rock it's like brash metal which all they do is they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar and the guitar is set really low
I don't really care for that too much I guess and what happens is like everybody gets totally into the music and then they start dancing around
and they just bump into each other
they hit each other with their shoulders
and then you knock people down and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
is that the kind of music that you like? I don't like that music
but that's what they do that's what some people call really heavy metal
and the difference between hard rock and heavy metal is the lyrics also really heavy metal is considered the words heavy metal and you always thought about suicide and killing people and stuff like that
and just hard rock has they don't talk about that they just talk about life in general
like queen's reich if you ever heard of them of course
you're talking queen is that what you said? I said queen's reich but you got to like queen also because
because queen was real popular when I was growing up especially a night at the opera? don't they have a let's see the one that they have the whole opera singing in the background bohemian rhapsody
that was great I heard that the other day on the radio and I pumped it up
because I just love that song
that was a real good one but they had that whole record was pretty good but then they started going downhill like everybody else
that's true they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that they're still around they've got a new c d out but I wouldn't buy it because what happens is the old I like the old rolling stones I don't like the new stuff of the stones?
I agree that's the the older stuff is the best of it the new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which I don't really care for today's rock and roll too much
for example I used to like old phil collins an old genesis?
definitely I agree and then what happened was that phil collins said I can make money a lot of money doing this and then he came out with his record no jacket required
that was good but it was on his way of going downhill because he said I can make a lot of money just singing alone and then he came out with the invisible touch with genesis and that really now I hate phil collins I can't stand him
because I look at him and I say you were singing at this time and with these people and you were great and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you sing or what you record it's still going to be a number one hit and so that's what gets me mad
but did you go see that new doors movie?
not yet I guess I've been kind of considering it have you seen it yet? I saw it when it opened
was it really good? it's like I was watching siskel and ebert those guys that criticize movies?
and they both loved the movie?
they said the music's great it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that
and then one of them said everything is great but I'm going to give it thumbs down and they go but why? because the end is really depressing and so
the movie is so well made and the music that goes with it just picks you up I was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine so for me
so you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then but you learn to it's just that the sixties music's got a lot to say
I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too I was like
seventies music disco I don't like disco I've never liked disco but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants that's true
that's true but I was more in the late I mid to late seventies between seventy five and seventy nine was more my era
did you go to college?
I'm going right now that's cool
but I didn't go then but I graduated high school in seventy eight
so in seventy eight rock was starting to get really heavy and real I don't know
disco was pretty much dead by then
so that's what I mean disco wasn't really my time they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in progression ever in history so
about music? about everything
so it's like nothing happened during the seventies everything happened during the sixties the seventies I don't know what they're called it's like the eighties are called the progressive years or the technology years because of all the computers and stuff
but the seventies got nothing nobody cared to name it
that's kind of funny
you're right I never thought of that the disco years are gone I know
can you imagine a big picture of john travolta what is it saturday night fever? him just standing there
that's a good example to look for in history from now on we're going to go from nineteen sixty nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties what happened in the middle? don't worry don't worry you're not missing anything so
that's true except for vietnam and that's why everybody
you know with it's like they don't want to talk about that so they just don't name it I guess it was pretty bad times
that's very true but let's see we've been talking for seven minutes so
good I haven't even been keeping track I'm going to leave you alone what are you doing? do you have a family?
I was kind of in the middle of supper but it's not a big deal I'm sorry
I just left it it's okay because I didn't somebody tried to call me last night but I didn't have my number yet I just got it today
and so it's okay I told them I'd be available during this time so
then have fun doing this it is not that bad
I guess I've had to return something but I can't decide mostly it's been because I didn't like the color
or I'm not sure whether I've had to return that many things
I'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned are you?
for me it's actually a pretty good topic so we'll talk about that some
we could talk about that and then we could talk a bit about just quality of products in general if they're better or worse if they last longer or something like that
I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like you're
let me tell you just a little bit about myself for years I did all that shopping and whatnot but for the last four or five years I've had eye problem
and I've had two cornea transplants shopping is no fun anymore
I can imagine I don't I can't see good enough and it's hard to tell what I'm doing and it's just
you can't read labels and you can't I just thought of something we have to return
there you go it'll come to us are you ready? laurie
tell me about your computer laurie I think that sounds fascinating
we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project and we called up the company and asked them details on it we bought not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper
and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with and they were very happy with the system and they felt they've gotten a good price and we went in we explained what we needed and we had to go across the george washington bridge to new jersey to meet these people
and so we went there we told them about the stuff and the guy said that the computer would fit our needs and we these things won't make any sense to you probably but he told us we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer
and it's called a user boards or slots is what it's called
and he told us there's four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user and we can put full size cards in there and so we said great we'll buy it and we put in our order and a week later we went back and picked up the computer and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it and there's only one slot we could put it in
and at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in
and the computer was supposed to have two
it has them but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it in it and even though they told us in advance that you could I see
they told us there would be no problem because the salesman just doesn't really know I see in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it they probably didn't know what they were talking about
that's completely it the salesman didn't know
so we went back in and we struck an agreement with the people who said change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards
so they did that and we said are you sure this will work we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway and et cetera and they were doing it at their own costs and so we said and we went back and we talked to the person a second time and things like that and then we get the computer home my husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldn't go get it sooner because I just had the baby and life's just a little bit complicated
and he goes and gets it brings it home first of all they're missing components of it like cables so you can't really test it out and then second thing we still can't put the boards in because they have other things blocking where we need to do it
and now we're dealing with having to bring it back again and they say they can do something different and change some connectors and we hope so but it's a hassle it really is
you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction
I think that's the worst part I
so actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card and I just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation and they said you don't have to pay for it yet that's an advantage isn't it?
it really is I think there's a lot not to be said for credit but that's one thing to be said for credit how it gets you some muscle where you need it
and so and I think that's really important
because these guys if they give us a hard time we're going to say you look if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're just returning the computer that's right that's right and if we do that I just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge even though they've already paid it that's right
but they'll just undo the credit that they did to them they will that's right they will
they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do
and we hal bought me small little jam box kind of thing so I'd I have my ninety three year old mother living with us and so she doesn't remember anything but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help
and I thought if I had a nice little tape recorder so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that I can copy parts off and if I can copy sections off that I can use someplace I figured this will be good
the first time I turned it on I was recording and the next thing I knew the tape was chewed up in the thing
so after that then you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side
and then on the other side when I loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to videotaping they were doing and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far and so you can't get it to run the right way either so
what brand is it? do you know? so I wish I could tell you I really don't know which brand it is it's
but I was wondering in our case where we knew we were buying a copy we weren't buying on I b m p c
and I was wondering if you I think this is maybe a name brand and I suspect that it's probably just a fluke I have the papers and everything and we're going to just take it back but
do you buy it at some major store? I think it was a highlands or something like this highlands chain down there that I don't know up here do they have highlands up there?
don't they? this was a regular electronics store
so I don't think there will be too much problem but I guess I'm not sure whether I think things are not made as well I think they deliberately sometimes
I think a lot of things are not made as well don't you? what are you
of course it's hard to think of an exact example
but I that's good they're getting kind of a attitude of not
I like electronic stuff
for one thing I know their work cars I think are not made as well as they could be
I think that's right the fact that
because I they want people to replace it after a couple of years
the fact that they have competition with the japanese and whatnot sometimes dwells on a fact that I've known people who have had toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them
they may cost a little more but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day
I had a toyota and I loved it
my toyota did really well it did a good job
so part of it is that we need to develop more of a pride in the kinds of things we do so we make them better
and it kind of has to start from the top or from the bottom maybe and go clear up people
I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship the people just don't care about what they're doing
the whole nobody's really paying
attitude is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do and on
give me my paycheck so I can go home what I'm doing I think that's too bad and it's a shame too because when you get right down to it most things if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough there isn't any way to get paid enough
but if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction so whatever you're paid is enough
and also I think I do research and so I'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done
and you get satisfaction out of it that's right
but I think things come both from the individual side and also from the company side I think they underestimate how much value the satisfaction is
because the companies that give the attitude that you're the last one hired so you'll be the first one fired
and we just want you to do your day's work
and we don't really care about you as an individual
when you've got that type of attitude on it the people don't care about their work
and so it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately starts with the one person that and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay
little value just in whatever you do that the value is in doing it well doing a good job of it and
what how do you get your main source of current events?
until recently I was taking the wall street journal and I thought that was a good way but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things it's a week or two late but that's how I'm staying up I either watch the news or occasionally I'll read the paper
do you like how it's presented on the news? I think the media's a little bit too manipulative they allow you they try to lead you too much I believe and sometimes they're not very open I don't know I think they're a little bit biased sometimes like for example the kennedy rape case the coverage on that was when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty they try to have you form opinions or whatever and then I didn't like the things that were going on when we had desert storm and stuff like that basically I think they don't present the whole sides of everything
so it makes you feel like they're wanting you to take their opinion instead of reporting the news it's more like an editorial on a lot of issues
I've noticed that too and it's kind of distressing isn't it?
and I've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words usually just that sway the whole report by just a couple of words when I was in school I was a communications major so I'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and so forth
so communications were you looking into becoming a reporter or I was and I ventured off in a whole entire different field I went with the state
and I went with the department of state treasurer in retirement disability calculate benefits
I bet that's a interesting job so the and working for state government you hear all about current events about things going on within the state itself so that's another source where I keep up with current events and
there's one that I'm reading right now it's information week it says a t and t to account for the benefits that the a I c p a now says you have to show as a liability it's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety three to account for that it's a lot of money and it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more it's a lot of money
it is and you have to stay up on stuff and I bet in your job that you have to do you read the wall street journal? I primarily deal with the state employees but I find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the state of north carolina's budget and stuff like that and I really know what the budget is and when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that and I'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has and it's just funny so that's so I don't have a whole lot of faith in the news course it's they get what they hear from but it's not always one hundred percent reliable
can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective? I think they need to go into a little bit more depth before they would just report somebody wants to make a statement or something like that because another example is the aids issue or whatever someone said I found a cure they immediately the headlines on the news or whatever is someone says they found a cure for aids and then two months later it's discovered it's not before they come out with something like that they need to research the matter a little bit more
I guess they do that so they don't get scooped so they have the big story that I it I think the
we're going to talk about the public school system what's wrong with it or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it
fantastic one thing that pops into my mind real quick is about the funding of the school system right now
evidently that's a big problem it's amazing I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough to be doing what they're doing
when I was in college I enjoyed teaching cause I did some teaching part time and I really enjoyed that but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high it just all the problems
an you talk about stress and pressure I tell you what it's they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready
do and they're being paid probably half what most people being paid
and and we're paying basketball people millions of dollars a year for what
that's right and then they poof it off do like tarpley
but I what gets me is I can't believe that our state legislature can't come up with some kind of workable means to have funds for the school it's I just don't understand that it's do you have little kids or what?
sure don't my wife and I've just been married about two years but I have a sister that's a school teacher and my wife and I have a three year old almost four and a two year old
so we're looking at the older one going to school next year not this coming fall but the year after that
so it's getting close he's going to be going to kindergarten so we're thinking about that
what's that going to be like are they going to be taught nothing or they going be taught something we're going to be involved in our child's education we're going to be teaching him what we can at home of course because I guess we don't trust the school system which is very sad
but if it doesn't start at home it's not going to go anywhere
that's true and we're going to try to teach him good values because when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write or understand some science
give me a break that's bogus
and one thing my wife and I've talked about are private schools whether we would want to invest in private schools as they're growing up because just in the dallas area we're not real comfortable with the public schools
and dallas school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling
I couldn't believe that
that's one reason we bought a house here in plano we were hoping the school district's going to be good for resale value and so on and so forth
but I can definitely see on down the road where we do have kids and are getting to that age that's going to be a definite concern you talked before about the school funding I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids that's the only way they're going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property people are going to throw a fit
that's and that's taxes right now are political suicide
and I don't think any politician's going to do that so and the only thing they would think of would be tuition if it works at colleges it will work down below
and that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do but it will be hard for people that have in school because they have to pay out even more
and it's going to really hurt the middle class people because they're the ones that will probably have to carry the brunt of the load that's right
and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and knives and everything what's
that's just unbelievable to me I can't believe that when I was in junior high and high school that never happened you never heard about that
we didn't even think about it and now what do we have now got kids that either got a magnum gun school
I'd be afraid to be in school teaching or even being a student and think what's it going to be like for my oldest son when he goes to school what's going to happen? I'm afraid for him to go
but there again you can't hold them back
another reason and you want to encourage them to be active and everything in school but with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it's a tough environment to be growing up in and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school and that was I graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine so that was twelve years ago I guess
so it's lot different now and what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my oldest son is in high school
that's right that's right I'm afraid to even think about it
that is a scary thought but I don't know I guess what you have to do is just keep encouraging them and try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up that's all you can do
and you got to be your child's best friend even when they're a teenager and they are kind of standoffish
still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or your parents
and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're going to be in even worse shape
that's right and the schools don't really encourage to stay away from that the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad maybe I'm wrong because I haven't been in that kind of environment for a long time but it just is amazing
need to teach them good values
that's true that's true and of course if I say this is a good value someone else is going to stand up and say and the a c l u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit which is going to take twenty years to resolve
and I think you touched on it you've got to start them at the home
that's where they get the deep rooted values and that's about right that's all you can do
then you just have to hope and pray that everything works out okay so that's right I got to be going so
I appreciate the call nice talking to you today
you to have a good life
particularly what kind of music do you like? I mostly listen to popular music I listen to it all the time in my car so I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I don't like commercials but I find myself listening to popular music
and quite honestly I have some little children and I unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately but that's not by my choice how about you?
I don't have that experience to share lucky you
I do listen to a lot of I switch the stations a lot because I don't have a cassette player in my car
however I do like a lot of different forms of music so I switch quite often I think I like I'm really particular about the type of music that I listen to
but the there's such a wide selection I like a little bit of a lot of different types of music I like music that I feel if it is performed correctly or if it's done right or if the version is done right I like it
but if it's not then I won't I really don't how do you feel about rap music? rap it seems to be so popular these days
I don't really have anything against rap music I the one thing I do object to about rap music is when it becomes militant or if it's violence oriented
I have strong objections to that actually I listen to one time I remember I when it was really just starting
when it was just starting I heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap
and it was about the piece of music was about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible the parallel between it and rap
and you listen a lot if you hear a lot of old gospel especially the black gospel you can really pick it up you really it seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm
and it sounds so much different and yet I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music and she thinks it's pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces
they do cover versions of standards that's right
I think it's kind of absurd the fact that they don't really give the original artist or the original composer the credit that is really due to them
I guess there was even a bit of ruckus caused by the m c hammer who's really
seems to be the hot one of today he used wild thing do you remember that song
he used I can't remember who the artist was on that jimi hendrix was the original who?
jimi hendrix was the original he wrote was it maybe it wasn't that one because it was a living person that I'm thinking of that said those are my words
and I guess that they because they hadn't originally gotten permission from him to use it
and he since then has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the song goes on but
I don't know it may have been somebody else because I think that even jimi hendrix did it I think that was a come to think of it I think that was a cover version of a john lee hooker song or something maybe so I can't think
it was just like it was really old
I there are so many different songs the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times I've heard some songs that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of I'm I don't want to listen to this because you think of the original is
that was really great that was a really good piece of work and then when you hear the cover it's what are they doing they destroyed it
I think a good one was there was a peter frampton song
and then the cover version I thought it was pitiful I remember seeing the video of it on m t v and I thought it was hideous
I did too it was I didn't like that either
but whatever became of peter frampton there was nothing he was a phenomenon there was no reason for him to really come into great stardom or anything I remember I saw him in a concert when I was
I think it I think it was in high school
I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer he was very good I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in philadelphia it was in j f k stadium if I can remember
hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like
I graduated back in seventy nine so
but I've really I loved I was really into the album oriented music even then
so I was really familiar with a lot of the a o r type music the album oriented like james taylor and the beatles
and a lot of people they go they're better than the beatles and I'm you don't know what you're talking about
the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles it was just you can only laugh
you just sort of I guess I can just humor them at this point they I guess our age is showing when we think that
but I've liked a lot of the new music I think when
I saw some promise with a lot of the new wave when it came out back in the mid and early eighties
and then I don't know it's in a very weird position right now I think that I like things like to hear what they call world music which is using all these natural forms of music and like paul simon like paul simon
really that's not world music but what paul simon's doing is great because he's using eclectic drawing from a lot of different sources and making a synthesis of a new type of music what do you mean by world music?
world music is a lot of where they make music that they adapt to another type of listener
for example let's say you're taking an original brazilian form of music with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for another audience a north american
and then when they hear it it's another form of music and sort of trying to draw out the best sources
the best of every type of music
because there are some I there are some types of heavy metal that I really like but I wouldn't say that I completely like heavy metal
I think and it's the same way with world music takes the forms that have really been the cream of the crop and then taking those qualities and then applying in the styles that are extremely enjoyable and then taking so then it becomes a kind of music of its own so to speak or
it becomes a kind of music of its own when you listen to it it's I think that they don't use some of it it's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably
so a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa now and from west africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles
but they're trying to make it somewhat more modern I another good example was I heard miles davis and miles davis worked with robbie shoncar if you can believe it
he's a jazz performer
and then he's playing with robbie shoncar who's a very good he's a very good arranger arrangement to we're going to have to get off the are they trying to
I don't know but we've talked our five minutes though
but when I heard his album I heard it and it was just incredible I've been listening to that a lot lately
I listened and I heard you hear this guitar and then you hear the muted trumpet I me and you never would think that they can actually play together but
I'll let you start this time
how much do you like lawn and garden work? even though it's totally out of my degree training I've been working in the horticultural aspect so the last fifteen twenty years I'm for goodness sakes
what do you do? I work for the state as a grounds keeper
that's interesting so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work? mostly snow removal which we've had a lot of
but I don't know I guess growing up on the farm and that I've always had a big interest
when I have an area to do I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and everything
I love to work outside really and I enjoy flowers and stuff I don't do a whole lot of it at this exact point in my life because I have two teenage boys and so they do all the lawn care
but I still take care of the flower beds and things like that
I was even planning to go out and to dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but were planted in the ground since last spring
and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me and about five days ago we had a freeze down to about twenty three degrees or something
so the hibiscus plants no longer exist that's terrible twenty three
and I really feel bad about it it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty five years that these were cuttings off of
so they're all gone at this point gardening in texas is really interesting though I grew up in illinois
and texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has watering system
and so with that our lawns do stay pretty nice all summer if you water
but in the winter we have bermuda grass
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
and I just think it's ugly
when I go back home to my parents in illinois in the winter their grass is fairly green that's one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant I think the saint augustine and centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there those two
some people have fescue that stays green all winter
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer
they have to water an incredible amount but those lawns look nice during the winter but they almost stick out like a pretty thumb but when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one it's sort of like I know my folks live in arizona there and they just grow rocks and that's their gardening there I guess as long as you can have some grass there
so I know I was in houston when I was working for a company once and we were taking care of lawns out there and that particular year they had just tons of rain it was raining continuously
and then I know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems
that's true houston is a lot wetter than dallas area that's where plano is and just humidity just all the time it's an awfully lot more humid
are you able to get sometimes a double crops of certain things in your garden?
I think people do I don't have a vegetable garden I guess I never have here actually but we have neil sperry talks on the radio ed
books actually I am reading a couple of different books one is a story it is not a story it is a collection of memos supposedly written by howard hughes
that was it came out a couple of years ago and I have just now gotten around to reading it I have had it a couple years but who wrote that?
I do not remember the man's name he used to be a reporter for the new york times or the washington post one of the two and he supposedly was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell and they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the corporate headquarters in los angeles
they on romain drive or romain street or something there in los angeles they had a big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he was a great collector of everything he did not throw anything away and supposedly this guy had been breaking there for he was a burglar had been breaking there awhile and had ended up I see
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they broke in one night and found a bunch of memos that were supposedly from hughes to his main assistant back in the fifties and in the sixties up until his death that is interesting
it's pretty interesting work so that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that
it's a little hard you have to plod through it and it does not have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on and they have not made a movie of the week of it yet I have not seen it
but it is real interesting
I also reading it's another old book that I happen to have I am sort of rereading it it's a book about the bermuda triangle but it's a real good book that a guy wrote who was a research librarian he wrote sort of debunking many of the stories about the bermuda triangle he was thinking many of the myths of the triangle actually could be explained explained
and the reason I picked it back up was in light of when they found the airplanes in the atlantic thinking they were flight nineteen and I don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's flight nineteen was a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two right after world war two and they were lost and supposedly scooped up by the triangle they were
and in the book even he wrote this book back in the seventies and even then he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water and because he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth and it's probably real close to what everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and could not find their way back on that same topic have you ever read anything about the amelia earhart story whatever happened with her?
I have not I think that would be I am sure there is something out there
I would like to too because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her possibilities of where she I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years
whatever this is one aspect of it
of course it is so weird cause no one will ever really know but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things that is for sure
that is pretty much for right now that is what I have been reading
I kind of like to read different stuff and I like to read a novel every now and then but I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time I guess I just have not read usually if I find a good book I will sit for two days until it is finished if it's that good
and I think the last one I read like that was scott thurow's and that was presumed innocent
and I just really really liked the way he writes it's just incredible
I read that too I got it right after it came out my
he was an assistant district attorney in chicago while he was writing the book and my sister in law lives in chicago and before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this this guy is from here
and I read it and really liked it and then about that is when it really got big so I that was good I think
and the other book was in the last year and I think I did read tom wolfe and vanity
bonfire of the vanity bon
I have not read that although I have heard it is pretty good
I that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book
that is what I have heard and
I saw the movie and the movie was a joke compared to because tom wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to pinpointing society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
and so it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
I know and we are not talking about that but I like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what to do with my garden and
I have a lot of computer books that I do computer work and so I have a lot of those so I spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but looking through them
but I'm interested in a lot of that but I have got a lot of books that I intend to read but I have not been able to yet for one reason or another what is a book on your list I have a list too and I have never gotten to it
I do not really have a list cause I just have all the books out I have book shelves and I have them all out and usually when I am through with one I will go in and look through I have one now and I can not remember the name of it that I got is the sister in law in chicago usually for my birthday or christmas or something will send me another good book and
I have one and I can not remember the name of it it is supposed to be a mystery
the latest one I've seen had to do with basically a manhunt and it was called manhunter actually the guy apparently had a mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people just kill them with as much blood and guts as possible
how awful it was truly awful it was not one that I picked but it did show some interesting things about the f b I because the characters trying to get him were f b I people and of the few good things that were in it it did show a lot about the f b I about the training and how they go through training and how they try to develop a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that and it was pretty telling about the f b I and their procedures
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the f b I going
they keep it rather secretive
the most recent movie I saw was two of them actually the rain man was one that was great one
wasn't that fabulous and driving miss daisy I loved it
I haven't seen that one yet and I need to go see it
you need to see that
that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was jewish and one was black
and this all took place in the south
and normally never the twain shall meet you bet especially in the south
and it really was a fantastic movie the acting was phenomenal as I recall it got some academy awards didn't it
jessica tandy won best actress and that's right it might have one best picture too it did it did
just as rain man with dustin hoffman that was tremendous and tom cruise that was
I think it was more a lesson for tom cruise than anything else in terms of how to act from dustin hoffman but
that was what much of the hype was that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman it must have been great just being with him on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his lines and all that stuff
and a good bit of that was filmed right in cincinnati which is just forty five miles from where I actually live in a suburb of dayton is the kmart there?
we do have kmart here you better believe it isn't there a kmart everywhere? that was so funny he had to or was it kmart
he had to buy his underwear at kmart
that was hilarious the first scene in that movie that really got my attention concerning the disease and all that was when he dropped the toothpicks
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image unbelievable
there are people referred to as savants also who can do most phenomenal things
and everyone feels they are totally retarded because that's the way they might seem outwardly
that's right but there's a lots going on in there
it's amazing and I think the best thing about rainman was the way that they put together the real awfulness of the disease only
and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it and you need to work with it certainly on a daily basis but then again work with it toward a good end not toward winning in las vegas for example and the
the warmth that developed between them and again it was a picture of relationships
again the relationship between the two that never would have occurred by accident I was so impressed with that movie I saw it three times
did you I can tell you so much about that movie just because it really rang a lot of my personal background I have a brother myself that's older and he's not nothing serious is wrong with him but we have gone through these lapses of a relationship sometimes
and then for no real direct reason we get into a really good relationship for a while and then back and forth so I was really able to relate to the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers that was neat
that's tremendous it's good because it does make you think about your own family a lot
and it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother no question he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that he likes the bang them up and shoot them up things
and it was like pulling teeth to go get him to see it but he gave the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for rain man he certainly didn't he only saw it one time and he didn't go back for more but he said he enjoyed it and
he at least saw it one time and he really I don't know he's kind of a dustin hoffman fan anyway but before he saw the movie he was disappointed that dustin hoffman would do this I'm come on
just think of what a phenomenal actor dustin hoffman is
he will do that to research it and to be able to mimic a person with the kinds of problems that he had and to make it believable
I was believing it I don't know about any body else but I was it was great
I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them he did great
it's just been delightful talking with you you take care up there and let's hear it for the summertime
absolutely I'm ready for it but they're predicting some more snow for our direction take care take care
I don't I am only twenty eight and I haven't had much experience with nursing homes I have never visited any of them and I don't think I've ever even been in one have you?
actually I've been in them but just visiting and we used to when we were in our teen ages we'd go on sundays and visit the older people but I have an elderly grandma that lives with us
and she's lived with us for five years so I kind of know how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home or we've had those discussions about should we put her in because she's pretty senile and and it takes a lot of care twenty four hours a day someone has to be there's someone in my fiancee's family
it's his grandmother too and they're her son his uncle whatever
he's recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and all the other children are working or whatever
they're all my parents age so he's got his retirement though is really twenty four hours a day they have a day care two days a week they call it senior citizen day care but she goes in the senior citizen center
so he gets a break two days a week but it's only for two or three hours at a time
and just you see a lot of things like was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now
but he refuses to consider any other I don't
to put her in a rest home? and is that how your parents feel or
it's more my grandma that feels that way
she says that when her husband died that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home so it's kind of I don't know I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad she has to have a little toilet right by her bed and it's
and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets I don't know it's a hard decision but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally I know at this I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents either but I really feel bad for the people I see not very I'm not really experienced but like I said I just have that one family and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now than he thought it would be but
when he retired? and he's got seven brothers and sisters and he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone and
it's that good for us just because my uncle and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months that's great
so that works out good that's a good idea we ought to
and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever I don't know what they're going to do it's really not my family it's my fiancee's so I can't say much
but I always feel like I would never put my parents in either and I wonder I'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children so if my parents do need to live with someone it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for
and I that's fine with me my fiancee and I both figure that's what's we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever if you know what I mean? we feel like it's our responsibility
and I feel like I would never put them in a home but I wonder if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something
you think about it and it's really I don't know this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country
you think? I'm not really familiar with how other countries and it's really more of a respect issue that the older people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people
and they really seem as wise and in this country nobody really pays attention
they're seen as senile and the old timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions and it's I'm not saying that I do either but it's just funny
and we really don't have any that don't have the social security and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on
even if they're in good health it's incredible
they don't have any they don't get special treatment and maybe they should because we're all going to get old someday
I know and so it's kind of a depressing topic though how old are you?
I'm twenty so and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother it really is and she drives us this is archie
archie I'm sharon have you seen dancing with wolves?
I've seen that that was a really good movie probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and I thought the story was pretty good too I think kevin costner did a really good job with it have you ever lived in that part of the country?
I haven't have you ever visited it?
I've visited the wyoming area I'm not sure exactly where dances with wolves was filmed I think it was the black hills of south dakota
could be I haven't been to south dakota have you been up to that? I lived in omaha for five winters
and that rolling kind of
terrain is fairly the thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it's going to win everything
and I had been told you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of that's true
I agree with that I noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it I think it's been nominated for twelve awards and all the critics initially said that it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud so it has surprised everybody the interesting thing is I had heard that and I tend to overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and the thing is it was a good story
and I guess that's what I really like although I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour did you?
have you seen sleeping with the enemy? I've heard that's really great though
you have to go see that one and how about silence of the lamb? go you must really keep up
I do I go every weekend I those are two definite must see movies I think sleeping with the enemy isn't that a is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful?
it's suspenseful I don't think it's very there's not really any blood and guts in it or anything like that it's more suspense the other one silence of the lambs is kind of a gory movie if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's pretty graphic at points but I think they're both excellent movies do you listen to gary cogill?
is do you know who he is?
somebody in south carolina told me about him he's the movie critic you've he's a movie critic on channel eight in dallas
and he has a talk show on the k l I f anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and people call in and it's if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting there's a certain a mount of dribble that they do they've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it's
anyway he it's interesting you listen to him and then you go watch the movie in fact people had just seen I was listening sunday night a little bit when I was going to pick up my daughter
but anyway it was the it's interesting though the difficulty with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it the question is did he really know it was going to be good or did he just do it?
I think he really his heart was in it but I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was I think it was something that he really wanted to do he wanted to direct it he wanted to star in it he enjoyed the story line and I think he really wanted it and whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office I think he would have been happy because I think he did a good job the self satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him do you know who the guy was that was playing the wagon driver?
a little piece of trivia the guy when he first headed out from the army post
who I don't know who that guy is he plays on murphy brown
he does? he's eldon her housepainter as a recurring character every week?
can you believe that?
I'd a never put those two together that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that?
I thought it's really funny but I thought it you think back and it was him but with the beard and all that stuff it's
real scruffy looking real scruffy looking
and it was really funny that he winds up playing in the movie but I thought it's good that it was a lot of fun
I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about five minutes I should think we've done enough
you think so? I haven't been watching my watch I guess does it usually cut off? is that what it does? I don't know why do we end this thing?
it used to just automatically cut off I think it just says hang up
but it says when the conversation is over just say your good byes and hang up so I guess so why don't we do that? sharon good talking to you archie
movies I haven't seen too many lately I have kids and we went and saw the rescuers down under over the break
do you have kids you take to movies or no kids
it's a walt disney movie and it didn't get as good a reviews as the little mermaid their last one and got all kinds of academy awards and things last year but this one was excellent the was that the animated version?
it's animated and I can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now it's just the special effects and in this movie there's this boy and he rescues this bald eagle and it's a huge eagle wing span of twenty feet or something like that and the boy actually rides on his back and he rides through the clouds and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out and they're flying all over with it and I know there must have been computers or something for animation this day but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation it was a good show even better than roger rabbit insofar as animation?
roger was a composite one
there's a movie I've seen roger rabbit that's not a recent movie but I enjoyed that show that was made several years back
latest one I've saw which was a mistake to go see was lionheart had claude van damme
of course I guess he's trained in this martial arts of some sort but the plot was bland the acting was bland it was just mostly centered upon his abilities to
chop them up? chop them up and
this is supposed to be the guy that's replaces bruce lee or whatever or the next chuck norris type of guy
or he's singular you know how they can make any single one of them in a movie to be a superstar of any sort superstar
but chuck norris of course could be just about equal if not more
and all of them could be in that fashion or category
it was about a french foreign legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother's wife who became a widow because he was selling drugs and he got killed
really uplifting? so he deserts and goes to new york and he starts out by fighting to make money and then he moves on to l a to where she is to just help him out
the hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something I don't know
I hadn't heard much about that movie I other than it was a chop them up movie but I guess that's one I won't go see it was worth the buck I guess
you went to the dollar movie? they show up at the dollar movie right after they come out they're usually not that great or didn't do that great anyway a lot of
let me see let me see another movie I watched I want to see that new one that won all those academy awards this year dances with wolves
I haven't seen that have you seen that one yet?
what I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting I guess what made it so good was the cinematography
the wide open the spaces and the music and it had an excellent story line everything about it was good
I thought an excellent one too was misery with kathy bates and james caan I'm not a james caan fan but that was a well directed and acted movie is that right? I'd recommend it it's a little on the violent side
but then what movie isn't anymore
our movies today it used to be x and p g s used to be r s and seems like the rating system is kind of switching that way a little bit I have no objections to it it's just and it's a matter of your taste
it's just that it's just that the rating system seems instead of having x now they have n c seventeen?
they just changed it because x had a connotation with it so and even on those type they don't show what you expect
a lot of those are really violent type movies
really gory that seems to be the norm of most movies but this is america
let me see one movie I saw red october
have you seen that one? I have that was pretty good
I read the book before so I knew the story line going in but they changed some things in the movie it wasn't the same I thought the book was better than the movie but I thought the movie was really good as well I always wait for the movie I don't have time to read the book
I don't I read about one or two thick novels like that a year
that's about all the time I can spare but that was a good show I thought I read an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the hollywood magic
all those underwater scenes I thought it looked to me like it was a real submarine that was in the water they that's the magic of hollywood special effects
I hear this movie f x part two coming out is pretty good is that right? did you ever see the original one?
I didn't it was you ought to rent the f x part one it doesn't say part one but it's f slash x
what's that about? a special effects man who somehow gets involved in this I'm not sure I can't remember it's been a while since I've seen it but he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody and he has to go underground and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done and
to fool people and and using makeup and using all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go all the tricks
that sounds like an interesting concept but you need to rent the first one first
to understand what's going on in the second? if that is that the second one follows the first I don't know if they have the original actors on that first one to that one
they're supposed to be coming out with all these desert storm movies this summer too I expected those
they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there I think
they had some in some of those they retitled some movies that were going to be about lebanese and americans
and they decide make it iraqis and americans and they just change the title and reshot a few parts where they could I guess they figured we can't tell the difference between an actual names will not be used
eventually they will come out with the proper names
it was such a it I guess they'll probably come out with a lot of movies it was such a rout though I don't know they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured latest story
kevin costner is supposed to play schwartzkopf supposedly is that right? I don't know that's just one of the many rumors that floats around or what you read
I think we've probably pretty much used up the tape
it's been about five minutes it's been nice talking with you same and we'll talk to you on the next go around
keep on watching those movies? how do you usually keep up with current events?
normally I listen to c n n or headline news about an hour a day and then I supplement that with radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week and a newspaper if I have time do you
I don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday so I try to listen to the radio in the morning and try to catch one of the morning talk shows and then I usually end up flipping through c n n and headline news during the evening I always try to read the sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the week's hot events so I try to catch that if nothing else
that's true and how do you rate the are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving? for local news I think we do real well where it's we live in a kind of small town but I think we get excellent local coverage and I like the national news that we see we watch n b c and I think they do a real good job so I've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get how about you?
on the whole I'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts I would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves since I don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite
I think I'm fed up with trite there seems to be more and more of it and I understand the void that comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations and as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don't want any dead airspace
but I think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries because I'm going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions I don't really need their help to do that
we're certainly in agreement there I don't think radio is as bad to do that as t v is
radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done maybe they're a little more efficient or have more to do over that same time frame
I don't know which that answer is I think my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like sixty minutes do you watch that? I used to but I don't anymore maybe once or twice a year
I used to watch sixty minutes until they did two programs that I knew both the people and the incidences
and I knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings
and ever since that time I just don't watch so I guess we have the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not I had heard a couple of people that I had talked to about certain programs say that they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the news articles or whatever they had already been familiar with so I started questioning just how bias they really were so
I don't know how old you are but it seems to me like the last newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted to hear was walter cronkite
so I don't know if you're familiar with him or not not really in the last few years just his kind of informal segments I've seen but I never got to see his actual nightly news I liked I did grow up with david brinkley
brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold of cronkite
and he did a pretty good job the huntley brinkley report was quite excellent over the years we used to watch him and john chancellor
and I always liked david brinkley and I used to enjoy john chancellor's style of reporting but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary and that's where I get into the problem with him I frequently disagree with his commentaries so
once they've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore what did you think of the news coverage of the war?
I almost felt like it was too much I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst
and I don't need their fill ins did that help you understand a lot what was going on your prior experience with the military did
but I think it helps me everyday in trying to review the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going I wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that people like myself might not pick up on
I think my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with sixty minutes what weekly magazine do you look at is it
I like u s news and world report at one time or another I've taken them all for a year
I believe in giving anything a chance
but I keep coming back to that one so that's kind of my favorite does that give a pretty good overview of everything or does it give little encapsulated reports and then a few big stories?
it's primarily a few big stories and then lots of high level reports
here's what went on in asia over the past week and there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was the focus of their main stories that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick
it too is one those in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways and I do most of my reading in the bathroom
and it's one of those that I can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I'm going to spend in there
and it just seems to fit nicely so that I can get it read in about three days we're working on a newsweek for the last couple of months we got an introductory subscription so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like glamour or sports illustrated so we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us
to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway it can't hurt
anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt I enjoy reading t news I try to catch it because it's another example they just show you the words and the facts and they don't offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to be caught up during the day because we don't listen to the radio at work at all so I don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything
I'm with you I have to check t news every day it's my noontime dose of facts and the other thing we have that I like to check sometimes is talking fingers do you have that?
you have different telephone numbers that you can dial and then you dial in an access code and depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you updated information that can give you current news updates current weather updates things like that and it's offered through the local phone company free of charge so that's an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use
it does sound very interesting it really is nice because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and find out about maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for I think it's catching on throughout the country
so what do you guys having up there? I haven't been up there since forty eight I guess forty eight that's a long time
it wasn't forty eight it was forty eight I was in the air force
we did an air show out at andrews andrews?
so what's it been like up there? for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
but before that for most of the year it's been hot and dry
september was hot and dry october september really was I'm not sure about october I think for about twelve months through september the average temperature has been higher than normal each month lots of ninety degree days during the summer
it really has been strange here this year course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one
but we have all these somebody said you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict texas weather but always they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever
and we had all this rain and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool but all of a sudden in october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time and then the end of october it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down there were flash floods everywhere that kind of deal and then into of november the first week actually we had a freeze
and the average first frost is the fifteenth of november here if you had it early
but usually it's not until later it's really strange I think we usually have a frost in october
but we really need the rain that we've been getting and it has not today but the last few days it's been pouring most of the day
is it flooding anywhere? flooding anywhere I have not heard of any problems of it flooding anywhere that's occurred certainly at times in the past but I've not heard of any particular problems this time
it's just kind of we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here which will be a little bit more typical autumn weather but really it's strange we haven't really had an autumn it's like we went into winter
the poor trees said what we had summer lasting long then it became winter today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day it's
there usually there's I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in east texas and all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to maine it's that same trees pines and hard woods hickories and oaks and stuff
and I was up there last weekend and there are trees that still have their leaves on and they're green but they're dead the freeze just got them
they weren't ready for it at all apparently and we haven't had a typical fall at all not much color changes have occurred at all really weird this year I'm not sure what that means I don't know our leaves are all on the ground now I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors
so you all actually had some color?
it kind of crept in and we did for a time
it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
gorgeous that's I think you could drive along in maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the pines and what not and you could be driving along in east texas and looks just the same it's almost identical kind of country beautiful been that this year for the trees for the leaves
I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend so
little oak tree that was dead and cut it up and split it that's because it can't tolerate a freeze this early is that right?
if it would came later it would be all right?
there's some trees like the oaks the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy there's nothing bothers them their leaves are still green and there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves what I notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead the dogwoods still look they got bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit but they still look pretty good
it just depends on the tree
I guess first of all I could have asked that before
do you have children?
because I didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt
what do you think about the proposal that all young americans should spend a year or two I think it's a good idea I think everybody should put in their time so to speak for the good of the nation and for the good of themselves
I think it's would everyone grow up and mature and realize what this country's all about
I just I guess that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and I had opportunities in high school to work in some programs did you?
and I agree with what you said that it benefits the person doing it so much I don't think they realize
and I think it gives you a better perspective on life
and it gives you a little bit more a glimpse of the real world and it would certainly help the country too
I think that's probably like quite a few things that the kids maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through
they did things for people for their communities for their families for their friends where now I'm not sure they really do
I think sometimes through groups and organizations when they asked the question I thought that sounds wonderful and then I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long but I do know through some organized groups like scouts and church they do still have opportunities
that's probably true
but I think that's a small number could but even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?
not as much as I remember growing up and that was something in the fifties and sixties seemed more common in the last two decades
I think that's probably true
but I think it's probably more true still in the smaller communities then in the larger cities
where abouts do you live? what part of the country? I live in richardson right now which is just
we're in plano so we're not far apart
one of the calls I'd gotten before was down to austin and I know a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area
I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're right I grew up in a real small town in florida
I mean a real small town and I think it was just of course it was back in the fifties and I think it was real prevalent back then I think people thought more of others than they do now as far as doing things for them and then gaining benefits from it
and maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back if we've lost some of that and it seems in the last decade or two that's true maybe that's a way if young people had to do it maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country is helping others I do to I do to
I'm not sure that today's kids would go for it though I think you would have to start younger
I don't know how young you'd have to go but I think by the time they're early teenagers anyway I think it's too late now at least around here
I think it does help even preschoolers they're things even just starting around the home
little ones can do a little bit to help the family
and just watching the parents do things too it can start a pattern there's always something no matter how young and then that helps develop that attitude I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more I think this is certainly a possible way to handle it but I wish that's something that I think that has been lost in families and I think that's a good place to start again I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for your own immediate family you're sure not going to do it for anybody else
and I do think the schools if you're trying to do something even with food drives and sometimes what richardson and plano both when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is
that's I'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas and it's that's probably true that's probably true
I know our church youth group starts with projects young but they have a high school group that works in the appalachia area every year
they've done this for fourteen years now that's great
and it's and they've also see that there's a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there
and it really every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective and that's just the two weeks during the summer
so if two weeks could have that kind of effect I would think that's great
I'm glad that there are still some areas that get the youth involved in that sort of thing
that's like I said I think it does even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes
I guess did you have anything else? I guess that's about all
I enjoyed talking with you good talking with you and I hope you have a good evening you too how are you today?
I'm great as a matter of fact before we started this conversation I was working on my p c at home do you have one?
I don't have one at home I work with one at work continually but I do not have one of my own at home do you have
what do you have at home? we have an actually it's a t I computer but it is the I b m clone
it's not the t I p c from back when
from the oldies but the goodies
it's probably pretty close to what I have because I have the same kind of thing at work I have a three eighty six s x which is t I computer but everything is in I b m mode so that's what we have
do you use it a lot at home? I really do I am an accountant but I work at home
so you're on it a lot so I use it for that quite often
we have used some of it for some personal things we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it I since it's tax season I'm doing a lot of taxes so I do a lot of that work on it as well
I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person and she works out of her home also
and the software that does the taxes is just incredible it is
she just I expected to go and drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later and she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little p c you can
it was great you can that's right
that's wonderful I have often thought that having one at home would be neat I just don't know if we would really use it that much we really we didn't decide to get one until I started working at home
then we thought we can use it for some personal things we for us it really took a business application to justify the expense of it
I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer probably three years ago for christmas and it's got some stuff on it it's got a nice little word processing software on it and some budgeting type things and stuff and I don't think she's ever touched it
it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer so she could just as easily do those things by hand just as quickly
I know my boss has bought the software that his checkbook is on a disk
and he goes in and types his checks on the screen and then hits print and they print out on the checks and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places
and he just whips out I saw him yesterday morning over there and he paid his monthly bills and he just wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print and it printed out like ten checks and he just they're perforated and he just ripped them off they go through just a continuous thing on the printer
and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went and he said I can balance my checkbook in seconds because it's all in the computer
so and there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make
that's exactly why he said used to be I always sat looking for those he said this way there isn't any it does it for you so this there are definitely some advantages to it it's just a matter of like you say does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business so I think in most cases I'd have to say no not unless somebody really enjoys it or perhaps is using it for education
I have a four year old son and we have some education programs that he likes a little sesame street one
and we have another one that plays music and he really likes that one as he grows up he'll be even more and more too that's right
that'll be great and on now I think about it I guess for kids as they get older especially now when they get to junior high school and even college
my sister went to college started about three years ago and she had to have a computer it was a necessity
I she couldn't imagine going through college without a computer
I'm going through right now I'm going part time in the evenings and I do everything has to be typed they require it you have to type it
and so I'm up here nights and weekends working on the p c up here typing stuff so I can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home if you were going to school any more I don't even know if a college kid would have a typewriter
you I don't know probably not even
and they probably used to have it I just finished a major research paper a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where I could go back in and move stuff around and change it
I don't know what they used to do before they unfortunately in our family my husband and I went through college together and then he went on and got his master's degree while I was working
and I'm the better typist of us
and we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then
and you had to type all of his papers it wasn't that long ago but I typed his master's papers and things on a typewriter
to have a computer back then
cut your time in half at least at least
at least and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over you take out a sentence on a computer you take it out print it out
take out a sentence on a piece of paper
you do the whole thing over
that's right I remember when I was working in high school I was working in an office right after I got out of high school I continued working there for probably another year and we did everything on a typewriter everything
but it's amazing then when someone would have you type a letter they did it right they were the first time
they sit there and they go is this really what I want to say and you typed it and that was it and now people just send it back over and over and over and over that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about because people do feel like we can just change it
we'll try this out and see what it looks like use it as just a
instead of knowing what they want to say before they they just play with it which in a way is nice to be able to do
but it gets a little out of hand sometimes I've seen it get out of hand up here where we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up of all the letters I type how many of them do I make changes on and on each letter what types of changes
are they typos? are they because I couldn't read it or people just change one word because they think it sounds better or whatever and she's also keeping what percentage of letters am I retyping for whatever reason
and there's one week she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed I believe it
and it's ridiculous and that was the high week but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types
it's good that she does that bring it to people's attention
that's exactly right she keeps several weeks worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show look this didn't really need to be changed this is ridiculous and changing add this time to now
that's the kind of things that she's keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste to change something like that
anyway maybe it'll help in some way but I don't know there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative I have to
without a doubt without a doubt I would like to get one at home some day we've got a two year old son and so some day I would like to get even just the video or something like that just to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful so especially when they're in school I think they would get a lot out of it
I do too I do too the on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful that sounds like such a great idea it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it I know my father had a p c and when we were in high school it was always fun we could link in and I don't even remember now what it was called but you could link in and talk to people all over the country
and you have your own little code name and you'd type in how are you and they'd type back and everybody and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they're typing it and it was just great fun it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance it was like a long distance phone call
so we were each limited to twenty minutes a day so that still could add up
it added up big my parents were divorced and so the time we were visiting our father in the summer time so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it
I'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations but when you're doing the guilty father complex because he's not there to watch us grow you can kind of get all kinds of stuff
that's sad it was nice to talk to you you too have a have a nice day you too
myrna how do you get your news?
most of it is from the radio and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon
we usually watch the local news and the national news both I'm pretty much the same I find that I'm a graduate student and I read a lot for school and I find I have no patience to really read a newspaper because I'm reading so much all the time and I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast
you can always get up and leave that that's true
I just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper either by the time I get home from work it's already time for the news to come on that's right
so it's so much easier to sit there and besides I can be doing other things and still listen to the news that's right I agree that's a lot of times I eat while I'm watching the news
the same thing is there any what did you think about the coverage over in the persian gulf?
I think they did a great job I thought so too it for a while when we were really interested we saw it all the time some of the stations carried it for twenty four hours for a couple of days there and then the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good
and you could always find some channel that had something on but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time just news that's right
I noticed that one thing that t I did they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings
and they used to have a program called t news and just updates of different things that were going on within t I well when all the mess in the persian gulf came about they started carrying c n n
they have had so much good response from this that t I now has c n n on all the time that's great
so we can always run upstairs and get a quickie update on what's going on if we really want to
or if you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed
that's really good that's I've found that when I went back to graduate school I just didn't have the money to rent a cable t v line or whatever so I don't get c n n which was a big disappointment I used to watch that was my if I wasn't home I'm a college teacher and sometimes I teach in the evening so I'll miss the evening news and you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on c n n I think that really has changed the way I look at the news
we don't get it either we live out in the country
and we just don't have it available out there where we are but when we did have it that's what we usually watched was c n n
and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations that's same that's when I had it I watched it religiously for half an hour and then you could go on to do what else you wanted to do
I find I read very little I don't even get a regular newspaper and because I don't drive that much I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work I find I spend so little time in the car that I don't really listen to the radio I don't so television is my main new source
I get that too because I'm in a van pool
and I'm in the van two hours a day an to commute to work?
and in the morning I try to sleep because it's dark thirty
but in the afternoon I try to read so I can not pay attention to what our driver is doing I can the van pools I know that and I'm in the baltimore washington area and I know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas but if you want a nicer home beyond the suburbs I that's necessary
are you in baltimore itself? I am right outside baltimore I am less than a mile from the baltimore line
and I go to a campus of the university of maryland that is just less than a mile from my house so I'm actually in baltimore you could say I'm in baltimore
I have two kids over there in baltimore? in d c area
one works for the state department and her husband is in the navy and he's stationed at bethesda an that's a really nice area bethesda area
it's funny there's a big difference between baltimore and washington even though they're so close there's only an hour less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values and the closer you get to d c the more expensive it is
and the different slant washington it really is an international city where baltimore is hometown baltimore there's really most people have relocated to the washington area
I'd rather have baltimore with the home town atmosphere that's I like it a little bit better too it's interesting though to meet different populations being from pittsburgh originally I'm just now meeting different populations like chinese students and things and I find that really interesting to imagine here is somebody that was in china two years ago when all that was going on in beijing that's an interesting perspective but I really much like the hometown area and I think that also goes it's funny you can watch different news I can watch washington news or baltimore news and I really do watch baltimore news that really makes I don't really bother with the washington station because it's so far removed from what I'm interested in
most of what they're talking about in washington is the crime problems that they're having there it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with hispanics they had to impose a curfew in two of the areas in the washington suburbs the mayor they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then brought in
I heard about that and then came a woman that's she's big in the democratic party so that's good so she has good national ties but she also was something like a state auditor or something like that before this position she was a state auditor I guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the district of columbia at washington and then she left that to get a position with the democratic party and now she ran for mayor so fiscally she's pretty tight and she's cleaning house and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job for washington which is you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there from what I pick up on the news it's a difficult process to get rid of a bad mayor
I know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the downtown areas
they both moved way out
I think one of them lives in germantown and I can't remember where the other one lives but germantown is a nice area it's a nice area
it's means they have to drive a little bit but they might be car pooling too do they car pool in? are they driven by themselves I think he carpools
because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back but they have probably been carpooling together in fact because she had been called back up active duty
and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last friday so I haven't talked to them this weekend I don't know what the situation is but she was they didn't call you for mother's day? we were gone you weren't home?
we weren't home but she had called and left a message on our recorder but I had that from all my kids except for one that's good
I guess we should stop now
I thank you for calling I have enjoyed it
I really do like this program because I get to talk to people from all over the united states so do I I've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever I really enjoyed it it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective it's interesting to see the wider world so I enjoy it thanks a lot and thank you where to start
I think I haven't had that much of course I just heard but I haven't had that much time to think about it either I guess the biggest thing I find is the financial aspects particularly the ability of people to access your financial records or your credit rating almost at will that's true I didn't think about that
and of course flying using your social security number of course permits people to do that
and almost anything you do now a social security number is required
and of course there's another aspect of this too in terms of invasion of privacy I just thought about it being a professional of course you probably belong to one or more professional organizations and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which I think is an invasion of privacy I agree
I get some of these things in the mail that I wonder where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name
and in fact some of these things I get some of these questionnaires it's funny because I was in the process of filling one out when I decided I would make this phone call but I haven't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information I just have a real hard time doing that and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and t v s and v c r s and you hate to send something off with your name and address and what types of things do you own and what kind of money do you make and you wonder who's going to get ahold of this and think that's a nice place to go rob
and not only that it opens you to phone solicitations
and I've noticed more and more over the last six months
I am getting more at home phone solicitations for a variety of things from I got one tonight about six thirty when I sat down to eat dinner carpet cleaning
I've had them for carpet cleaning I've had them of course for real estate investments
you get send in this particular card and you get a free trip or something along those lines
and so that bothers me because of course I enjoy being at home and I do not enjoy getting called by strangers soliciting
so having your and I know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls
they just start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers but some of them are sold and I know you talking about mailing lists the I there is one particular group to which I belong and for some reason they have three different names for me
the address is the same my office address
but they have one under my first name james they have one under my first name and middle initial
then they have a third one under just my two initials
and I get mail here at home under each of those names
so I know that they have sold their mailing list
and I think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy
and I can't really think of anything else offhand that I think I dislike the phone number part the worst it's one thing to get junk mail because you can just put it right in the trash but it's the phone calls and usually when they call you it's going to be right when you sit down to dinner because they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you right when you've just gotten home from work the last thing you want is a phone call unless it's something halfway enjoyable but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with and I've gotten a lot of them lately or I'll sometimes I come home from work and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine and I'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day and I wasn't home and they'll probably call me up and call me back and bother me when I sit down to dinner later on but I find that very annoying the mail stuff
it's kind of irritating but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls
I think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
I know when I sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity to talk and see what's going on and all those things
even if friends call it irritates me
so I try to actually during that period of time usually from six o'clock or six thirty whenever I get home until eight or so I will shut off the phone
and my daughter gets irate when I do that because she's a teenager
so she'll why are you cutting off the phone I might get an important phone call
so I guess those three things are the most irritating to me
I agree with the phone too in that I'm single but when I come home from work there's times I need to pay bills I need to balance my checking account I need to do all kinds of different things like that and even though it's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time I need to get things done and the phone ringing bothers me but that's where answering machines are nice because if it's really important they'll leave a message and I can call them back
that's right but at work I have so many phone calls from customers calling in sometimes I just want to get away from the phone ringing because it really does annoy me and if I've had a lot of phone calls during the day occasionally when we have this past week we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system and phone rings like crazy and you come home and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone and if it's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse and it just I get to where I turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone but now with this thing I'm participating in I kind of have to answer it because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's somebody calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone
now we have a voice mail system at the office
what I have done is I have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that I do not have to have a ring at all if I want to do that a ring at all that's an idea
or I will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to the office
and so it makes it convenient but at the office when I on our system and on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service ours is that way too
and when I want to be not bothered during the day that's exactly what I do
and so yours is probably the same as ours it's tigon isn't tigon part of g t e or vice versa or something like that seems I read
tigon is part of g t e
that's it that g t e had purchased tigon and that's what we have except we call it aspen aspen?
and we I couldn't remember in tigon had purchased g t e s phone mail services or if g t e had purchased tigon I knew there was some type of a tie in there I remember reading in the paper a few months back but
g t e purchased tigon
and so we had been using the aspen service before they purchased tigon
so I imagine we will be shifting over to that service in a while as soon as we determine what we're going to do with contel after we bought contel
dana I think we have probably conversed long enough I think we did that's good
I didn't think we could go too far on this privacy thing but I guess it's close enough
thank you for calling I enjoyed talking to you good talking to you jim take care
I haven't talked to anybody outside the metroplex so I didn't even think of saying arlington texas
this is a real first
are you at work? I am
I've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and I thought I'm not having any luck I'll try the middle of the afternoon I'm happy we got through
I am too do you have any opinion on the subject? I'm especially interested with what's happening in the soviet union the ukraine's vote basically to secede and set itself up independently is quite a remarkable counts democracy
is that reported in the texas papers?
we hear a little of the news I have heard about that the last couple of days how big is the ukraine the area do you know? as an area it's not
or a population or anything I'm really uninformed I'm afraid I don't have the statistics in front of me
it's not a tiny area if I was looking at a u s map I would say it sort of reminds me of a it's not as big as california proportionately
but it's more significant in the sense of it's a great agricultural region
I see I didn't really know that I know a lot of their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them
and what about astonia are they they're completely out now
I thought they were the three baltic republics got out as quickly as they could
but the ukraine is especially significant because of the agriculture? it's very important for the economics of the soviet union
so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could except they can't fight
they don't it's done democratically
and bush has already given his opinion on it? didn't I read that?
so now not that that may matter I don't know anymore I fear for the russians from what I read I wonder how they're going to get through the winter food wise or any wise
sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon or not that that would do any good but I guess people do that when they're desperate that's true hasn't happened here for a while but it
that's true since the depression when the veterans went to washington
and the war riots of course let's just hope we don't get to that point
things are not so good in texas job wise I hear you have some problems
we do we have lots and lots of layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs and it's pretty scary do you blame the government in washington for this?
I don't understand economics that well I don't know I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't
and so I assume that that has a great effect
and they said during the way reagan bush years the rich got richer the poor got poorer the statistics prove that so I guess then you think it's reagan and bush have done this or is it just coincidence it was during this period?
I really don't know I think maybe they contributed to it maybe they should pay more attention to the more equalization of the trade
of course if somebody in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions I don't know what's going to happen then the chinese use slave labor too
that's one of the ways they get away with it and child labor
I don't know what do you think has caused our horrible situation? I don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing
one thing that's very complicated
they say too that having a democratic congress and republican president is not good I've read that is a theory which one are we going to throw out?
I hate to say it but I'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party
texas used to be a democratic state didn't it?
I know it used to you don't want too many democrats anymore and for a while I kind of deserted the party but now it's looking better to me I like your governor
do you? I'm glad to hear that she's an impressive woman
I think so too I just admire her a lot
and I really hope she does well but she's probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win
but look who she was running against anybody could beat claytie in texas he shot himself in the foot so many times
how did you get on this t I thing? I know some of the people
why don't you start you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
I'm already on my job you are
so you reached me at my job how do you dress for work?
my dress for work most of the time is rather comfortable and casual usually slacks and a soft colored shirt
the thing that distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is I wear a clerical collar and a suit and all of that sort of thing
but when I don't need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort I don't
you're in a church there?
this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds and they have bible lessons and they have all the things during the morning but they still have snack time and play time so I'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and t shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just tennis shoes and play clothes
around there you can probably wear t shirts and other things but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and coats I'm envious
it's a beautiful day here and it's in the sixties but we still have a lot of hot afternoons it's supposed to be eighty five today so you'll still see people it's kind of an in between change that they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons because you just can't stand the sweaters but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly
today we wear coats and as the day warms up we may go to light jackets did you? but I don't think there's an escape from light jackets I understand
the wind will take away a lot of body heat are the people around you dressing similar to you?
very similar you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do
I'm not stuck with that kind of a situation that's good that's good
as I say unless it happens to be yesterday I had to dress up and be more formal because I had a formal meeting at noon time
but then I can go home later in the day and be a little more casual that's wonderful
and then if I have a meeting of people that I know I can be very casual in the evening my husband has to take the bus into dallas and doesn't return all day so he has to dress and he just really hates it they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
around here in a lot of places that's the way it is
there are expected dress codes
and the people need to follow that I think years ago I used to be far more committed to the idea of a dress code
but I've relaxed a lot more as I've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself I think that's great I think that's good
it's taken a long time to break away from that I understand
but now that I've broken away from it I'm glad I have another interesting thing on our end here is how much younger I dress than my mother would have in her forties and I will run around to the store in slacks and tennis shoes and she
you mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses any more? and pearls and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school
so she tells me I dress young but that's okay
that's a good idea that's a good idea there's not a lot more I can think of to discuss on clothing
there I guess this is what you call a natural end
what kind of shoes do they wear down there? we wear of course like I said if my husband's going downtown he's got the whole men's dress shoes
but for as out here just anything that the moms we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids
we can wear pretty much that although tennis shoes are kind of out in almost every situation unless you want to look like a gook I'm sure they are there I'm sure they are that's right I'm sure that true it's a lot different than working in a kids preschool
a lot different that's right you all have a nice day there you too and thank you for calling thank you very much where do you live?
in the houston area I used to I lived there for a long time but I'm now in palo alto california which is the recycling capital of the world
that's great so we have many recycling activities and I'm in full support of all of them
we are too our community is just starting to get organized about it they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our things and dump them off ourselves
and it that's something but it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better cooperation out here by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra actually I don't think we pay very much extra at all too but the garbage men come by on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
I think that's great there's a few places in houston where they're trying that out I don't know if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded bags and bins we have burlap sacks
and they give us one for aluminum and steel one for metals and one for glass
and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags so we leave three little piles that they need out on the curb every thursday
and the garbage men come by and collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape
that's great and it really pays for itself because then the city gets the money from the recycling
we're all for it our we've got several bins in our garage where we sort things out and take it to the appropriate places the one thing I wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way they're bound it's too expensive to recycle them at my office we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail
and they're one's for white paper and one's for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or things like that goes in those boxes
but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and there's no way to get rid of them it just seems like such a waste
it does it does but I'm sure that they can find some sort of use for them if there I've seen talk about using garbage for energy
and so you could also apply the magazines toward that that would be a help I wish they would do that here we have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade
and it's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things
I know it we did have another novel experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out
you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they're about four feet high
and you get them for about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you usually buy them by the dozen
and then you put all your yard clippings and leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible
and the garbage men also pick those up on thursdays
that's great and then they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing and at the end of every year they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds
that's a great idea I wish that our city was that involved in recycling like that
because I've talked to many people and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience I think most people would
and I don't mind at first it was the little extra money that you got returning the cans in and stuff like that
but now I don't mind as long as things are getting recycled that we don't get reimbursed I think it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up then to get that two cents when you take it to the store
I know it we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans for cash
but so few people have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back
plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also do the grocery stores in houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags?
we have I know the one that we use has recycling for the bags
and they're promoting the cloth bags the reusable cloth bags we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
that's great they just take it off like they do a coupon they can just subtract it from your bill
and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags
and they say as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop
here they don't want your rotted tomatoes but they want any clean and dry plastic bag so I keep and the thing is I hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle so right outside the back door I've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
and there right outside that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags
I understand my husband about once a weekend he'll go to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
and he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that he how nice that's great
and it's so we have all our piles of recyclables also
I remember at christmas the only thing that I'm when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did was they provided a place for us to take our christmas trees for them to mulch for city use
that's they just put all our christmas trees in the regular compost pickup
so they did say that you had to put it out within three weeks after christmas
and otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths
so if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths
but otherwise they have to be in one of their paper bags
that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there and they even picked up our styrofoam packing materials the week after christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only if you have any of those little styrofoam peanuts that any of your christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling
and we'll take all of those back and try to recycle them
that's one but I that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after christmas
the but something does need to be done about the styrofoam that those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
they don't they don't mash
they don't compress at all and they stay forever
and I've seen where some places have taken a plastic and they're recycling them into other plastics and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that
and I think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines I do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff
because otherwise they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts
I was thinking about the styrofoam used at the fast food restaurants that if everybody
and so I know our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam but we quit that about three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody
and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five year drought and so it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or china cups to use up our water but at the moment we're using the china cups
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then you're supposed to keep it recycled every day
that's good that's a
they should last awhile let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get better reuse of things because
I believe we are I have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
and so it will be good in the long run it sure will
I enjoyed it good to talk favorite type of music or musician or any
I don't really have a favorite type I like a lot of different types of music do you?
I have a tape collection that I like to listen to cassette tapes
but it's pretty varied
how about you? I'm very varied as well I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for maybe heavy metal and that
that's exactly me the acid rock or the heavy metal
even some of that I like okay but not mostly as a general rule
I don't care for that at all I don't enjoy rap too much either that doesn't appeal to my ears
as far as the rap goes I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves
and I like some of their songs
but as I agree with the general rule I wouldn't choose rap either
but I like to listen to what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz classical
I don't I like like I said pretty varied music
I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to like billy holiday
I really love to listen to her
and I even have a tape of lady smith blackman bazo
and they're very harmonic they really are
so they're interesting to listen to you might try that how about you? I listen to specific most likely I would be listen to jazz or classical music in college I took four years of classical guitar and I played in the jazz combo all four years I play guitar for the jazz combo
so that's where my two listening enjoyments are but jazz can get on my nerves after a while you can't just listen to it especially a lot of the deeper stuff you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're playing it
it's too you have to concentrate on it it seems it just doesn't do anything
what about the blues or something like that? blues are okay I tell you I do like I grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so
I wouldn't have admitted it when I was in high school but I really do like it a lot so
I like some of it as far as what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it? it doesn't it doesn't
some of it sounds more like pop music they've all got the real screechy electric guitars now
I don't care for that if I'm going to listen to today's country western I have tapes of randy travis and clint black
and I even liked jim reeves I I grew up on him
or merle haggard and faron young
that type of country western is what I like to listen to
asleep at the wheel sons of the pioneers stuff like that
I like sound tracks a lot do you?
it seems like you get a lot of original music that way you sure do
think about the twin peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent
things like that I like to listen to I like instrumental things
I have some spiro gyro tapes they're great aren't they they're wonderful
I love them I have some dulcimer music like I said that's pretty varied it sure is
al jarreau he's somebody I like he's kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop too
I like his he has a nice smooth voice
and what I like the most about him is I've gone to see him in concert and he looks like he's having fun
some people sing and they have their faced all contorted like it hurts them or something
but he looks like he's having a good time he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it too
and he is real fun to listen to
bonnie rait I like her a lot
in fact whenever she won her big grammy
I think it was five of them or something
was it five or something like that it was last year wasn't it
last year or the year before I can't remember but I was listening to a particular radio station and the one d j said who the heck is bonnie rait and why does she deserve five grammies?
I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that radio station any more if that d j can make such a how are you? I'm doing fine where you from? I'm from new england massachusetts
I'm from berkeley california this is quite a long distance
it certainly is do you have any pets?
use too use to but none right now how come you don't have any now? you get tired of them?
I live in an apartment building and it's just not feasible
I'd love to have a dog I've got a little doggy that I've had quite a long time in fact she just turned sixteen years old new year's eve and is she? I beg your pardon?
what is she? she's a poodle a toy poodle and she's
I got my mom a teacup little mutt not too long ago this is a little bigger than a teacup
and it's funny how I acquired this animal when I was married my ex wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that the woman needed someone to baby sit and this is what she had told the kids and she even told me that and after the two week period was up she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it after you had an animal for a couple of weeks you become attached to it for sure
so I've had this dog now for sixteen years and she's been a lot of company she's however getting a little old and things are starting to fail I live alone now and she stays in the house all day while I go to work and she's been holding herself pretty well up until recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is and I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home but she's usually pretty good
my mother has one that's it's uh teacup and it's made such a difference for her but just I the way my mom's presence countenance is just for having a puppy but having this dog she's had it for three years now possibly four
but it's really made such a difference for her I really would like to I'm a disabled person
so I'm unable to really take care of a pet and if that weren't so I would certainly have one I just it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog you might want to get yourself an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat
I typically am not a cat person
I have a friend that has on occasion brought her cat over for me to keep from time to time and this cat is like no other cat I have ever seen and it would sleep on my chest
it's just a great cat but my personal preference is a dog I don't know that I would ever want a cat I like cats I just wouldn't want to own one they're affectionate
you don't own cats but they I don't know I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog
they own you or grant you with their presence
that we're supposed to appreciate them when I come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door I don't know that a cat would do that
I used to have a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life
I could just walk in the door and she knew whether to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over
she really could pick up on my mood the way I walked in the door
it was uncanny I think in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too so I know when she has an accident I know she's not doing it on purpose
when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
and some people might not believe that but I do
if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours because I was going out she would break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did
that's the way I had that cat that I mentioned alfie one morning the first thing you do is you get up and you feed this cat something and you make sure that it can get to its litter box for some reason during the night the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
and the next morning when my roommate got up and did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest
and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it
have I got your attention now? animals have a way of talking
alfie did I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day I don't know that I'd trade my dog in for the world it was about two years ago she got sick on me and I took her to the vet's because she wasn't eating and she wasn't able to jump she lost all her activity and she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said she had a low white cell count and that she was dying and suggested that I take her to a animal hospital so I took his suggestion and I took the dog to the dog hospital there and they said they'd keep her there for three days she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care it cost me over five hundred dollars
plus the vet sent me a bill for what he did then she recouped she was okay for a couple of years and then she got sick on me again and I brought her to a different vet this time and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything and he gave me the same medication that I gave her the last time and she was okay and she's been okay every since it's been about two years now
that's great it really is I'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time the problem is if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive what do you want to do? I probably would have had second thoughts
of course you would but what they do is they say it's going to cost twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and it creeps up on you you don't know that you don't know what it's going to until it's all over
to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who whoever evidently got a hold of it and the cat got sick so she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died so the doctor had called her up and said your cat died and you owe me this bill and by the way do you want me to bury the cat
so it cost her three hundred dollars and she didn't get the cat back so they had to pay for all the medical bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
and she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good so that was kind of a surprise at
you kind of wonder what really happened even the they claimed they did the best that they could have and then the cat died so
I'm looking for another cat for them
I've got a little kitten that's still just being born right now so another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to my folks
that will make their day I think it will because they're both in their seventies and the cat although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns out to be a pleasant experience for them I think they enjoy that only work initially for cats anyway
listen it's been a pleasure talking to you the same here and you take care
maybe we'll talk again sometimes what is that sound?
that's my buzzer at the door I'll let you go thank you
how do you feel about our policy in latin america?
I'm all in favor of it I think we've been doing a pretty good job not taking advantage of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us we could direct the government even more than we have been I don't think we've been doing too bad do you think that's right? do you think we should direct the government?
I think as a whole that being that the drug industry can bring so much money to a country I think that if it wasn't for the united states government matching that the drug cartels or whatever would control most the central and latin america
just that money is power
and I have a friend that's his descendants are from nicaragua and very it's like his mother came over
and he I just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about our intervention and their government and stuff like that
and he was all for it because it's just like you say there's so many people there that get the kind of control that's bad
and that their governments can become so corrupt and it's like I use to feel like
they should work their way they should be able to work their self out of it or why intervene in another country's problems and things like that why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that but I think just a lot of times if we don't then that influence will affect our country too for one and for two that it does help I think the people in those country do want our help the people that are under conditions that are not favorable to their rights
but but I wish we didn't have to I'd rather even if a country chooses a government that's not exactly the kind of government that we have or as in complete opposition to it at least it's their choice as long it's one that makes since so to speak it is a government that stays in power that can stay in power but it seems like most of them don't
sometimes that's america doing that too
we fall out of agreements with certain leaders and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader it's so you think c I a influence and our money over there
that and america starts talking then about removing bases and whatnot and stuff like that and people
or government aids and stuff
I think that has a lot of things to did with then how can you say in europe as far as the toppling of those kinds of governments that was I mean
I'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not because on one hand you have the soviet government of course mistreating a lot of the slovak countries and then on the other hand you have
they were feeding us so I don't know really what's going to happen
but we're not intervening in that or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing are
I think we're getting quite a put it this way I think I think the people are revolting themselves and
and we're allowing it to happen I agree with that
I agree that communication has become so much more widespread and worldwide that people are realizing we don't have it so good and let's stand up
this is ridiculous we're living with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is
that I think people are just saying we don't want anywhere of this
I think central america has always been one of those places where people are more passive where it's always the minority that are trying to make the country better
I don't mean to I guess I do in a way sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that I think that because of those countries where such catholic influence and I think the catholic religion itself was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down so to speak I thought it was the other way around but
they were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it it's been sort of
but I don't agree with that because the catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak they are the ones that set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down
when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're expected to bow down to it I think that keeps people in sort of line
I don't quite understand that do they even understand what's being said? when it use to be latin I'm just saying that the old church the old church
which it's not that way now but I think that it's just latin countries are slower in coming around
they actually understood it is in america where it was hard latin is very very very close to spanish latin
they still didn't understand it though I don't think
because I descend from that and I don't understand latin
and I'm of spanish descent so I just think that has something to do with why latinos tend to be the more meek
they tend to be more not stand up for their rights as much they're not really sure of what they are I don't think
I never really thought of it that way how can you contrast the europeans and their vocalism on their rights to the people in latin america
why are they not as vocal or why do they not stand up so to speak for their rights?
I don't know could be the economic still
the there's the poverty level is certainly much worse in the latin american countries you can say that about africa too I think it has something to do with the poverty level because africa is certainly not a catholic country
and yet they have the same problem where kings and such I don't agree with that
I don't agree because I think that they are pretty vocal about it in africa I think they've made a lot more chances they're very vocal
in south africa in south africa I think they are but yet so what's the difference?
idi amin was in power for so long
so what makes the difference between south africa and rest of africa?
racial I think or like you say maybe communication of knowing that up in other english colonies or previous english colonies everything is equal and yet down there it's not
I think communication does have a lot to do with it in education maybe
I don't know about education because the black community is still not very educated down there so I think it is communication it's just oopsy I think it maybe has a lot to do with education because you look at the european countries I think they tend to be more educated much more educated than africa or the latin american countries
that's true you know that I don't know whether actually I've always wondered how the education system works in the russian countries the republics
I know that russia they're comparably better educated than we are in our country
that's good in a way something we compete with
and I've been sort of disappointed that they say literacy rate has gone down that's sort of upsetting to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer in our country? in our country
that is really upsetting and considering it's free good education is really still free that's just it though good education
is it good education? it may be free but is it good education and that's just it are we willing to pay for it
a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all but are they willing to pay for quality education?
and yet people get very frightened when they see the japanese moving in and the russians moving in certain areas of technology that we use to dominate and it's like they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do so you're going to have to expect it so what you are you willing to compromise a little and take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education so I don't know but I
this is easy for me since I
and me too because I eat out a lot I travel I do about forty percent of my time on the road
so you eat all your meals out I eat a lot of meals out I'm also married and my wife is an a one cook but she enjoys eating out so I have to share it with her and actually it's very easy for me because I make it a practice when I am out I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here
so I look for just about anything and it's a lot of fun I don't have to really worry too much about price considerations because I
I was going to ask you could you go to nice places and and it's really great I like different types of food
what are the memorable places you've eaten? you name it let's see you've got one down near addison there's two restaurants that I particularly like that every time I get into texas or I get into atlanta georgia I make sure I go and that's houston's houston's
it's a great place it's great there's a restaurant right outside of reading pennsylvania that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people
but it is fantastic there's a restaurant in panama city of course not too many people want to rush back to the country panama
because I was thinking I grew up in panama city this is the country panama I get it
but I have gotten to quite a few and I go to canada and get quite a few restaurants up there and I know the locations and I know the places but lot of times I don't remember the names I'd have to go back through some expense reports
but particularly down in your area I'm looking for some more restaurants so I don't know what's down there the ones out in addison do you like mexican? do you like mexican food not particularly
that's one of the few which one were you going to recommend?
there's so many places here it's just lots of good mexican restaurants here
but in the addison about everything that you could want in dallas is in the addison area anyway
now there's a new italian place sfuzi I have a
but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in dallas and now there's one in addison let I'm writing it down it's s f u z I
and it's in addison and it's a great place also a great place that they have cajun food is copelands I've been there
now I really like copelands I've been there one down there is the I think it's an old schoolhouse
the I know I don't like that place I like the food but I don't care for the clowning around
when I went I thought the food was not good I've had magic time machine is the place you're thinking of that's it that's it I've had excellent food there
when I went I thought the people drove me crazy first of all
but then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was that's great italian is fine I make it a habit of always going out to pasta oggi's which is right down there in
do you like southwestern?
now there's a good place in addison too called blue mesa grill that's on belt line that's close to houston's as a matter of fact
and it's great they have I think sometimes I've been when I thought it wasn't as good but I went there recently and I thought this really is good
so that's a very good place to eat the blue mesa grill
and this is great this is going to give me some more places to go a whole new dining experience
I guess our time's about up so
they haven't beeped us have they? they don't always
I thought sometimes they say this is three minutes or whatever they've been doing that when the circuits are busy
and other than that they leave you go about five minutes and then that's about it I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat so
it was a pleasure talking to you
thanks for calling for helping us out you bet
let's see I believe in the trial by jury I think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for payoffs briberies unfairness one sidedness all those kinds of things and I also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody I really agree with the innocent until proven guilty theory I think that's a good way to do it that's about all
I think basically we're in a lot of agreement in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs some kind of legal definition
but for anything involving that trial by jury certainly should be mandatory
but there should be with our overworked judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of not having to take everything before a full court maybe there ought to be some kind of isn't there a type of word called a jury duty now
and maybe instead of just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of twenty five instead of twelve
and each case is presented to that group of twenty five and those cases are lesser degrees of magnitude the guy was caught burgling and he had his pockets full of stuff when he was caught
that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say your pleasure your honor and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing
but the way our court system works that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
I just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stretch the true meaning of right to a speedy trial that's a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury or do they need a six person jury or those kinds of things and the seriousness of it how is this open and shut like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened a jury like that
we they could be a good idea to that could work
kind of off what we've been talking about here I believe that we've become almost a litigious society where everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff and although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that
maybe instead of being so quick to sue you if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you and if you want to your lawyer or your opponent need to go face this group of twenty five or a judge like they have on t v good idea
and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case that's
and let's get rid of some of this harassment suing that's a good idea I in the bible it says if you have something against somebody to go to them first and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church so that's right off that same kind of principle
you bet and if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the that's a good idea
that's true that's true too but that whole biblical concept that's true in a lot of our the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't work on that but it's based out of that so that could work
I'd forgotten what that's called there's a real name for that like the judean law or something like that what is that called? the judeo christian ethic judeo christian ethic
that may be right it's in there some place
I think we both know that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society
and too the that was sort of the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly
I guess the lord started out with I'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what I say that's sort of the old testament version that's
I know I did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament where there's a vengeful lord in the old testament and there's a loving lord in the new testament
but that's a whole different subject
I think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on the legal system mine too mine too
but it's been a pleasure talking with you same here what part of the country are you from?
I'm living here in texas in texas I was just being curious
that's quite all right I'm from the dallas area so am I that's neat
in fact I'm at work out at lewisville are you really? I'll let you go and it was nice talking to you my pleasure have a good day you too
what are your do you use credit cards?
not very often I usually the ones we use is visa and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month
I have so it doesn't get the credit
the interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy don't you?
otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's not a very good idea that's right
do you have a lot of credit cards? I have a lot of them but I don't use them very much though
I use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes tuition if I'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as I can the other thing I think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off more than one at a time because I think you could run forever paying what they require just goes on and on
which is what they want
I think a lot of people go in debt because they think I can just charge it but really if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in a month so that's true
they make the mistake of pushing all their cards there are times when it's very useful like emergency trip or something
sometimes when you the money will be available but it's not immediately handy I think they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
but you really do need to be very responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble
I made that mistake when I first got a job and that's kind of it took me quite a while to pay them off
so after that I decided I'm not going to use them at all and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then we got married so we decided if we used them we would pay them off as we go
that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances the other thing about them is too you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and haven't developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things if you pay for everything by cash there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or a car
that's true so they have become a very vital part of our monetary system over the last few years
but it's true you have to be very careful or you end up going in the deep end and an awful lot of people are in trouble
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card company that and he makes calls to people who have problems credit problems that are trying to work out
and poor thing he comes home very depressed every night because the world has so many problems of that sort
it's a really big problem and takes mature people to treat it
so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
I think the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards with a big write off at the end of the year
but now it's punch money because it didn't do you any good now does it?
you can not you can not write off your interest even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
I'm not other than that I don't have too much on credit cards but it's good to talk to you
you too for calling now
what are your first comments on that subject?
my first comments on the budget I would say there has what would you start cutting what would be the first thing you'd cut? defense?
surprisingly I would cut the prison systems and let them self support mean private enterprise?
have private enterprise do it?
you mean the prisons? they're already talking about it they're talking about having it as a business so the government doesn't have to deal with it
I hadn't heard that but because I think it's all either state or federally funded or obviously
but there's not enough room in these prisons and that to continue funding it
but to me it they think they need to maybe have private enterprise come in so
the other way I'm thinking about is they should be self supporting like the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work rather than sitting there
it's the same thing the whole criminal but the whole police department of the united states I feel the same way someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there
so it's self defense on that point as far as my defense budget they're cutting it back now twenty five percent? I wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that
but again I'd like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today so I'm lost on that one I would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems and to come up with something a little better than what we've got it's tough to say what as far as this that good or bad or what but I was just talking to somebody else and all those european countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that they so
not so much pay I'm not trying to see the government put out any more I know what you are saying but I'm just saying that even the differences is that some countries pay for students to go through college and etcetera but here it's just up to high school
but we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college to go either as an apprentice which they do in other countries just doing it which would bring the education back up
why not apprentice out to a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or just a technician? you can learn on the job of course again which would mean again
our education budget will go down if this is in a few years it's not going to be overnight
but that would come down I think that's one reason we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board they're not willing to put the training for only a certain amount
so it's as far as the technical side but even one of the biggest things now is paralegals and stuff they're trying to get more people into that field but they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to school in that area before they can work for a lawyer as a paralegal
I see it being done I know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her I'm assuming that it can be done my perspective is that I've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they are unwilling to put the time in they want somebody when they bring them in that they have a certain amount to contribute obviously there's a lot to learn after that but that's true I'm sure there's a lot of businesses are small businesses that could let me change my channel I've got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up is that better?
it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad frequency there or something so we had some interference so I changed that
it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere
but I think maybe they need to help promote that more give incentives like if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is for them to train people stuff like that programs like that
I don't know what kind of options they've got
that's something about what germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now and they have jobs out on bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields but that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with people at high school level which I would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school
they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around because they don't have any education
I don't mean college and I'm for college but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote college is concerned they've had it I think I just heard something the other day it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college and then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree
I thought that was interesting but most people I knew have gone and got their degree so
but there's a lot of them out there that haven't I was basic in a upper middle class area
that's and so I think that demographic area there a lot of them do go on and they go to college etcetera
it seems to me that kids that get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if they're said it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a happier life for themselves
question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do? as far as the deficit that's a whole nother my perception of the budget the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money going out and too many goods coming into this country and part of that problem is still japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country and obviously the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here and to start even that out we need to continue to at least threaten that we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to ours but it's just that they're I think you're going to find that just because the united states there is such a demand here the market and the money being spent and the goods flow in we don't sell products abroad as much as we bring in so
were you watching I think one of the news stations they had on there where the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting
what do you feel are some of the main problems?
I'm in an urban area I'm in dallas
and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem even a more major problem in dallas some of the major problems drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with people trying to get money for drugs
and I think that's a national problem though it's pretty bad here too it's not unique we've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff in durham which is right next to raleigh
we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you? that durham raleigh and chapel hill is the triangle
research triangle and all of that
and I'm sure you have a lot of students there and a lot of researchers so you may have perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like there is a crowd that's really effected by this bill really it's and I've seen more in durham than I have in raleigh or chapel hill
chapel hill is kind of a ritzy city or whatever it's kind of I'm sure there is problems with it but it has a pretty low crime rate compared to durham has probably got the worst they've had forty eight murders since the beginning of the year
and over half of it has been drug related
here I'm not sure how many dallas has had I've houston is averaging about two a week or three or four I don't know a number every week
dallas is having quite a few seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or like I say drug related I guess the other thing that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values seems like a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to
I that and the economy is so bad and so many people have been laid off and stuff
the economy is lousy they've done special stories on the local news here
we had a lot of bank robberies and lot of break ins and stuff I know a week or so ago I live in a town house which is it's a pretty nice neighborhood and this lady was going to work she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything and nobody thought any different they just thought she was moving it was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned
that really takes someone who is bold to do that it's pretty bad
do you find that security is very good in a town home? I would say so for the majority in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home
and we all know one another and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that
that it's I'm probably one of the youngest people that live over here
I see most people are retired or they're in their forties or whatever and I'm in my twenties so I'm out more than they are but they're at home at night
so I really don't worry about anything
I think you hit on one point there is you know each other
I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything I am about three blocks off a major road and a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs I guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the commercial districts and I'm over the northeast part of dallas it's in a nice neighborhood the houses here before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now that's the same thing here
but we have one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the they're not nearly as selective as they used to be
and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so I'm sure that aggravates it also but unemployment now in dallas or in texas is up around six point
my name is dolphene I live in texas
my name is pat johnson and I live in texas too I work for t I do you also?
I live in dallas I work for the dallas school system you ready to begin? we might as well
I understand we are doing care of the elderly?
and how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? I don't think that any of my relatives would really like to go there I believe if I am in a position when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also or have someone go into their home and look after them that way
I would find it very difficult to place my father or my step mother in a place like that particularly since I know how they feel about it
it's more how they feel about it
and it is like they feel like somebody had thrown them away?
I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to look for if you are faced with placing someone in a place like that aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such
but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference and I have a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who could care for her
and I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about her situation and another thing to think about on the positive side of the nursing homes here I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home
and I got to see a lot of the things that they did
they had a lot of crafts
and they had a lot of games and they get together and just do they do all sorts of things and then there some of the people that are in there are very nice and friendly to everybody
and then there are others that are it is just a job and they just want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home
the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important
I think it would matter too kinds of disabilities that the nursing home accepts because there are some who poor things don't have any real grasp on reality any longer
and they may be ambulatory but they tend to behave like small children
and that would be very difficult for an adult who wasn't in that situation to have to deal with on a daily basis
it is like the one that I worked in you would see some of them just in wheelchairs all day they would just roll themselves around all over the place and they would enjoy themselves with activities
and then you would see some of the others that were distant from the other group and they just didn't participate together with the others because they had some slight mental disabilities and things like that
what do you call alzheimer disease and stuff like that
alzheimer and they weren't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities and that can
what do you think about it?
I guess I'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the concern for the idea of preserving privacy for the individual privacy
because I can't really see why anyone who has nothing to hide would object there is always the possibility even remote as it is of
of course that is certainly true
and that bothers me I'm very much for drug testing
I really am I'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it
I have to take medication for kidney transplant
and I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life you
I don't know how that's going to affect
if you had to have a drug test?
I haven't had one yet t I I work for texas instruments
and we do have the random drug testing but I've missed it so far but in the back of my mind it always bothers me and what happens if they catch it they think that I'm on drugs and they send me and have me go through this thing
checked out or whatever
but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that I agree that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test
but I would think that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that for example that one positive would not be accepted as an automatic reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive dismissal or treatment or whatever but that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps one or two more stages where further tests could be done
because there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with false positives for certain kind of drugs on the other hand I think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in the transportation industry specifically
but in many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but himself and his own family perhaps depending on the kind of drug he might be on
but and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works and so on
but there's so many things that it would make a difference I guess I would not want to have anyone in my family victimized by a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who hadn't been tested like I said I'm very much pro testing and this is why
number one is I'm kind of I know this sounds like a slogan for the government but we are in a war against drugs it's horrible
you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
and it takes some drastic steps at this point and I think personally the drastic step has to be that you can't work if you continue taking drugs
it's as simple as that make it not necessarily difficult make it difficult enough but make it so that it's not glamorous
it's glamorous taking drugs or at least it seems that way
according to what you hear
the people who have serious problems we have really I guess we're kind of lucky we really only know of one young man who's a they go to our church
and it's the son and so on and he was friends with my children and he's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up having been involved with drugs but I know of a number of other people who have gotten all messed up
most of these are young people I work in the education system and so I have a little more contact with that but the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking
and he may never really be a productive member of society but sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are almost uncontrollable he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not he's so messed up
and this was a nice sweet young man who teenager and he's now a young man about twenty who just got really down the wrong path
and I don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing but seeing what drugs did to him makes me realize what it could do to people in the work force as well
it's horrible then let's answer the second half of the question what limits ought to be put on it do you think?
the limits would have to do with what I'd alluded to before that one positive on a drug test would not constitute dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might have set up for those who genuinely have a problem
in other words there needs to be more than treatment before dismissal type thing
there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some measure of certainty before anything drastic happens
there are lots of things that are involved there such as perhaps denial of insurance for someone
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this that it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or even people who might be of the gay community and I'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society but I think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination
because it makes a bigger problem so it seems to me that there needs to be some rules that protect
I'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say certain segments should not have to be tested I really don't see why personally I think that's what I was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested and
I don't know why it would be bad to test just it
and it may be it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that they that it could happen
would be some measure of protection but the bottom line is that if you're going to stay clean and straight then you're going to do that because you want to
there's going to be some measure of incentive reward or whatever but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
so I've got to agree with that that's very true
it sounds like we agree anyway I think so
I think we did pretty good
I guess that's about it
I guess if that's all we've done and I guess we've talked long enough
it was nice talking to you it was nice talking to you too
did you watch the bulls this morning?
you know what I watched a little bit of the bulls game and I had to leave in fact I think the bulls were ahead when I left who won the game? they won in a squeaker they won by two points
is that right? they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back in the second half and at the end I think they looked like they were closing it out and then detroit kept coming back and isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end
and I think the bulls won by two
don't they have the best record now? I think they do as a matter of fact
one of the commentators said that they expected that the bulls would set an n b a record for seventy wins in a season
they looked real good and
they do and they I think by relieving some of the pressure off of michael jordan really helped them out they don't have to rely on him to score thirty or forty points at every game
so they're balancing their attack and I think they look like they'll repeat although here in the bay area people are real impressed with what don nelson's done with the warriors
I know I'm I saw just a little bit of the highlights of the warriors dallas game I saw the second half of the game last night and they were impressive they look good billy owens looks like he was that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him
I haven't kept up with what was going on with the they traded away mitch richmond or is it tim hardaway one of the two who along with chris mullen was though three were three of the best in the n b a and they made a heck of a threesome
and they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens and
good move he's really worked out well the warriors have got a team and I think that will be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the lakers are down in fourth position in the west and I don't know
in the east I don't know is it boston in first place?
I think boston's in first I haven't kept up with any of the other teams I'm so depressed with the dallas mavericks they've had a hard time they said they've lost a lot of squeakers
that but just this whole year has been just disastrous for them and I think they're going for an all time record of how many losses in a row they can pull out it's unbelievable how do people in texas deal with dallas houston and san antonio do you for example like san antonio in dallas?
actually the dallas area here pulls for dallas san antonio pulls for san antonio and houston pulls for the rockets so there isn't much crossover
there really not a whole lot you find them to be pretty loyal with the local teams
I guess it's kind of like there in the bay area you don't find a whole lot of sacramento fans it's true because san antonio isn't that close to you are they? really isn't
it's about the same distance from here to san antonio as it is from there to sacramento is it?
so it's not something you'd drive
so it's not really a local I was thinking maybe david robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing
he does a lot of local stuff there in san antonio and they have got a great club they've done a good job of course drafting a franchise like him certainly
that always makes a big difference that's
I think that's the way it works now in basketball magic was a franchise for the lakers and bird for the celtics and
and I used to think that one player really doesn't make a club but it really does it
you get somebody like magic and you can see the decline in that team
once he left it's not the same team there's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for I think you're right and I think isaiah thomas would fit in detroit and I think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players and I think jordan and the bulls have to be considered the likely favorites
I don't know who would meet them in the west I don't know how good portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so
who won that portland game? I watched only a few minutes of it and I wasn't paying attention and so I don't know
but phoenix and portland have both been very good clubs and tell me what you think about the vietnam war
I'm a vietnam era veteran and I was fortunate not to have to serve in the theater however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation I'm of the old school that believes that the contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored however I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker but those are my personal thoughts and I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run world war two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people but as it was the politicians ran the korean conflict and ultimately the vietnam thing and we managed to come out losers all the way around and so this is what ultimately triggered us united states per se deciding to get out of the role of world policeman your views as I understand it we got in there because of france
france was there first they had
we got into it because of seato agreement back just right after world war two that we pledged a mutual defense of the south vietnamese and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another and really we I question us now of course hindsight is all too clear
so we have to deal with the situation as we played it jerry what did you think of people like jane fonda another anti war activist
I don't get me started on those people before jane fonda did what she did I thought she was a wonderful person but after I just don't want anything to do with her any more because you support your government right or wrong?
right or wrong I don't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong because you're having to deal with again I think we could have made a different agreement back in the late forties era that would have kept of there
I didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that I thought we came in as first advisors to the french and then they decided to pull out and
can you hold just a second terry?
one moment wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something fascinating that's not sorry for the delay that's okay
this is the mutual defense thing was we it was complicated and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation I don't but what I can gather is we went and said we will help the south vietnamese should they ask the french went in and tried their old style warfare and got soundly thrashed and we didn't do a whole lot better I had thought that they had colonies there or something
that was the old french colony but the french were our allies in nato
and they're also our allies in seato which was the southeast asia treaty organization which has since been disbanded as far as I know nato is on the way of being disbanded but the french we go in as an ally to the french and says we'll help you out if you get in a bind they got in a bind and says we don't want to play any more
so we kind of got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly operations and then the full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera I'm thirty two so I I missed it seventy four is when they quit sending troops
roughly I was just probably three or four years
first of all I want to tell you I have two little kids but they're not in public school yet I get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
so you haven't really dealt with that in a sense
but being one of these late in life mothers I've listened to everybody else's complaints as to what's the matter with either their kids or the school system
so I've been surprised
do you have school age kids? mine are both out of school
and I've in hindsight seen some things that I wished that I had done something about that was within my power or wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over what's happening up there type thing
such as? just over the years there were situations that came up that I didn't think were fair or handled correctly or the teachers didn't seem to be teaching anything of course it's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child
they bring things home and I was never one to believe everything my kids said about something
but still I questioned the ability of some of the teachers to really do a bang up job and yet others I know are just wonderful
I heard a frightening thing actually I didn't hear it it was told to me or suggested to me that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of texas if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of people to teach math and sciences
and somebody said you could go in and substitute teach at seventy five dollars a day and there's always going to be somebody having a need for a math or science teacher I thought they're letting me in to
this would be frightening I don't know anything about it that's pretty interesting because just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it
and even if I knew how to teach the subject matter I don't know if I'd know how to handle that kind of a group of kids in fact I think that's one of the big problems today is the way the kids behave or act and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive
I tell you what I'm finding frightening and this comes from the aging hippie near forty mother so I went through this period of supposedly cosmic social enlightenment
I'm in the plano school system and living in richardson and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school
and I used to think that's wonderful they can get a real life experience what I'm seeing now in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from in different preschools it's like day and night
and I wonder how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak english let alone know her colors
and they're in the same classrooms and I guess also you're going to see the first of the crack kids starting kindergarten I think it would be next year is what I'd read I thought how do you weed those out? some of those certainly have a lot of difficulties with all sorts of things and I would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases
when I was listening to n p r the national public radio and they've quoted statistics that my throat just about fell into my toes they said at the bottom of the s a t scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education that's encouraging
and I got to thinking back when I was teaching college chemistry the people that took the lower level courses I sometimes wondered are they really even educatable or trainable and it are the rest of us who went for the big bucks staying out of where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids?
I don't know that's an idea maybe there need to be some radical changes made do some things that are totally different and unheard of
you sit here and you think about that at the same time you think I hope I don't sound like a stage mother because right now if you ask my friends put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children you're going to have twenty hands up there you're kidding
nobody has a nongifted child
and I keep thinking gifted is einstein or musical prodigies it's not a kid who's precocious
what has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted?
I don't know that's interesting I don't know mine did not fall into the gifted category
don't say that and I would never had said so either but they managed to get through although not always with flying colors in fact one of the incidents I was thinking of that my son had he was struggling with senior english and I had a meeting with the vice principal and the english instructor and she showed me a paper that he had just handed in and she told me what she had requested and I read it and while it had a few little grammatical problems it wasn't very long and so forth I thought it had some nice well thought out parts to it
she gave him an f on that paper and I thought here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject and you give them an f on something that doesn't seem that bad to me what are you telling that student? you're telling them that you might as well forget it
I think that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years because I have a stepson now who's twenty five and I was just absolutely shocked the first time that I saw his schoolwork I remember being taught and you have to teach how to write an answer and how to construct a thought process
and they can grasp the points can they convey the data verbally or in writing and that's what's really scary to me I would really there's such a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate I would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age and if they can't if they have missed that training then somebody before you're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking teach them these basic skills it's pretty sad to think about those who even today are graduating from school and they are telling that they don't know how to read
my stepson he went into the navy or air force I just really get my military I married into a military family and I don't know I address them all as generals so I don't offend anybody
but fortunately for him he wasn't dumb but he sure had trouble putting things on paper
and one of the things that they did for him they tested him and they said that he's great in electronics but he really does need the basic skills and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors
this is the kid who really barely made it through high school
and I keep thinking it's really not too late at any point to do that's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it
you would have expected them to be the last ones to
and I kind of have always pooh poohed military educations but I think that for this kid it's going to be his lifesaver otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses from here to eternity so I don't know
it does make me nervous I can see why if you've got little ones just coming along there's a whole lot of stuff going on out there
there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and part of me says I just would like to shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't go on or send them to private schools and then the old social conscience says I'm not working I don't need to work maybe I should volunteer to teach what I know
maybe adult literacy maybe composition writing maybe volunteering on a tutor line or even through the elementary schools for help with homework or the other part of me says is I've had enough kids do I
do you have any pets now?
we don't right now we've I grew up with pets my folks and I always had a dog and a cat some birds
but right now we don't have anything that what about you? a matter of choice or compulsion?
we've just it seems like we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something
and it was never convenient to have anything
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house
someplace where there we can take care of it and everything we've got some children who would just really enjoy having an animal a dog I think
and what about you all?
right now I'm a student and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat
is that right? they're very strict about it
but you like pets and things? I love animals
I was raised our house when I was growing up there was almost never at least one cat in the house
it was almost always at least one cat sometimes fifteen or twenty but always cats in the house we enjoyed them
we like pets but you've got to deal with taking care of them and feeding them and everything like that
and our kids are we've got some children and they're not used to it on a daily basis they how old are your kids?
from fourteen down to seven you sound like you've got some small ones in the background one is that right? our first he's about eleven weeks now
where are you from? originally? west virginia
I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country but I've been to charleston charleston west virginia?
that's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway?
in the north end of the state you've got that little narrow strip of west virginia going up between ohio and pennsylvania
right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown
that's interesting so it's really up north in the country really
I guess so it's my parents house is three miles south of where the mason dixon line would have hit the ohio river had it continued that far I see
it's pretty nice country up there? it's beautiful
hills or what? from my neck of the woods it's hilly
maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation type variations from the valleys up to the hilltops
is it farmland? not a lot of farmland there mostly it's there's individuals growing their own food most of the agriculture it's more in the way of sheep and cattle
and even that's small time mostly
the biggest chunk of what's going on there is industry
it's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants
aluminum plants there's two aluminum plants
what are you studying there at heidelberg? computer engineering
what year? just finished up my fourth semester
I hope that works out well it's a big change
I spent twenty years as a mechanic what's so did you?
you've got some experience behind you in the work force
are you shooting for a bachelor's now or a master's or what? I'm working on a bachelor's degree
I'm working on a bachelor's degree it'll be
hope it's a good program there
hope it's a good program there it seems to me from what I've been able to find out
that's considered a pretty good program it's nice and small which means if you don't get the class this semester then you've got to wait anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again
but it's worth it once you get it
that's good and probably a good student teacher ratio and things
most the class are pretty small
that works out real well
I was wondering what if you all were to get a pet if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere what would you get? first off we'd probably wind up with a cat or maybe a puppy
I'm partial towards the larger dogs
our last we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus
had a hamster or two and they got to be a lot of fun a hamster
it's amazing how much character there we go
I'm a dodgers fan from way back
how way back late fifties early sixties
so wally moon moon shots and all that what's that?
coliseum wally moon and all that
it's a I'm living just west of baltimore and frederick which is also just west of baltimore has a minor league team and wally moon is the manager of them is that right?
so he's still kicking around that's interesting I also lived eight years in ohio before going away to college and I used to go watch the toledo mudhens
I saw them I was out there last summer and I saw a game at ned skelton is that the stadium? I couldn't tell you for sure it's been a long time
so there used to be a race track
it was that was impression I got when I was there so I think that's right
so had a lot of fun actually I like minor league baseball a lot it's cheaper for one thing that's true I think I've kind of become a rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here they've led the american league in batting fielding and pitching but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any given year so
I think they're in for a odd year this year actually they I don't understand why encovilla got released I don't either the guy's twenty twenty five home rums maybe thirty eighty some r b I s
he can't field and he strikes out a lot but he's done that for five years why get rid of him now? he really has become a very decent fielder
he's not the liability that he was that he used to be
he fits right in with detroit bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot of course get a guy like cecil fielder if he strikes out a lot so what
with detroit they can get away with one guy like that if I were in detroit I would start building the team around fielder
but that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out which they did
I think the key for l a this year is whether oral herschiser can come back I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter it may be
I like them a lot I think they're going to go all the way and by saying I like them I like their chances I actually don't like the dodgers I'm a giants fan from way back
picking up darrell strawberry didn't hurt
but butler didn't hurt either and bobby ojeda didn't hurt and who's the last one
bobby ojeda they got him from the mets for hubie brooks
he's a pretty decent pitcher he's he is he
and that guy the short stop is going to be good
it should be an interesting year
I'm looking I've already been to one game and I should have been to two but are you an orioles fan?
the team I live and die with actually is the red sox mostly die but I go to the orioles since they're here and I do enjoy them
I've had an opening day on monday I kind of wish that they had inter league play like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the national league teams here once in a while
how far is houston? three hundred miles
keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes it's incredible
I we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a national league team I can usually go up to philadelphia there you go
and saw the cardinals and cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before you are a baseball fan aren't you
I try to see whatever I can I've been to thirty or forty games each of the last few years
hope I'm going to do it this year because having a kid this fall so it's so much for going to lots of baseball games
so do it while you can
seriously it's been good talking with you
good talking with you and you'll be happy in october when the dodgers win I wouldn't mind it
I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right god bless and good talking with you
and good talking with you take care
I suppose we both have credit cards
they seem to be a part of life
how do you use them? I do use them
I have a few favorites that I use more than others and I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to
but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few
and they all can build up
I think they're handy I just get I don't carry a lot of cash with me
and I hate writing checks when you go shopping
do you use credit cards?
I use a few I watched my grandmother go into debt on them and so I've and then I guess my mother grandmother
so my mother learned from that and I guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so basically I just keep them I use them so that I build up a credit rating
but otherwise I generally and my husband I've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something that's good
but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge that's wonderful
so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what your savings is bringing
it's really ridiculous to let them keep building
that's what I feel so but I know some people can get carried away with them and let them get out of hand
it's really easy just to forget that you charged that or charged that I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come but sometimes I forget and so a bill will come in and I'll think I didn't know it was going to be that high
but so far we've been able to pay it off every time so that's good right now I'm kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them have gotten higher
and I saw on t v they had a program on credit cards and they're supposed to I don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some other state had a visa card that was the lowest one in the country and I didn't write it down at the time
and then I went and looked to see what my visa was and I think it's eighteen percent or something
so think I want to find something that has a lower rate
have you ever used discover card? I haven't
I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off but you know is that the one from sears?
I think sears originally put it out
but it's pretty well taken all over the u s now I've haven't found many places that don't take discover and there's no annual service fee which is good
and then they also give you cash back at the end of the year for the amount that I charge I get two dollars back or something
but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back they give you money back for using your credit card basically that's it I didn't know that
and I think the service charge is pretty low too but I'm not sure sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards
I worked at sears for over ten years and it was only a sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with another credit card that was accepted
so now they'll take the discover but I still don't know if sears will take visa or mastercard
but I never did apply for a discover card
I just figure with the visa and american express I probably have an
I can do enough damage with those two
I think it's best to keep the number down that you have
I've got some that I haven't even used at all past few years I probably wouldn't be able to use them
but I do like my dillard's I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop
and I do use dillard's probably more than any of the other department stores but
do you have anything else to say?
not too much more about credit cards
I don't think I do either so
it was good talking to you good talking to you beth good luck have a good evening you too
do you have recycling in sachse?
we do we've got a pickup twice a week that they come out do
and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it
and it's twice a week?
we have recently started a bin program here in plano where
used to be we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up and now they have these large green containers and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet but they're planning on doing it very soon apparently the trucks that they had lined up they needed the parts for saudi arabia
and so that put off the program for a while but do you recycle? my kids do do they?
put it that way they've been recycling cans for extra money
so that's been their summer money and they're fixing to go to disneyland so that's great
that's the way we started too my daughter was going to camp goddard which is through the plano school system in the fall couple of years ago
and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to baby sit so that's how she started she started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and aluminum cans and plastics
is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they weigh it or whatever
and the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans
the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling
and so we don't get paid for that but that's okay
it's not that much of a bother really you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of two liter bottles and milk cartons and things like that it's amazing how much plastic you generate
I was amazed at how many cans that we got
because when the kids first went down I said that's great and I was thinking maybe I'd help supplement it when they turned them in
but it's amazing how many cans you go through and how fast they accumulate it really is
all that stuff and how much we have reduced our waste that we're generating a week
I know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said there's no way we're going to have to have pickup twice a week they were real upset but they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container
and it's really amazing the other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings
he got a little mulcher thing
it's just a little attachment for the lawn mower and we mow once a week more often then that and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the lawn and it's amazing it's amazing we don't collect any of that and that has cut down a lot in what we throw out
we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard so if it gets mowed I do it normally and I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it it's too heavy
so I just mow it and leave it
it just soaks in sure it does sure it does it really does and it actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're catching your grass clippings
that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing
I like it better doing it one it cuts down on my mow time anyway that's true
and you zip through it quicker that's true that's true I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it
we probably will it's really not that much trouble we keep a garbage bag in the garage
and as soon as we use something we crush it up and put it out there and then every few weeks we have a recycling center near wal mart
they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble
and I feel like at least we're doing something
I read a magazine article and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but it's not if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day just from not throwing out your newspapers
and when you read that you think maybe it is a big deal
what makes me sick is when they show the dump sites and how big they are
or in new york the barges that go up and down the river
and they don't have any place to put it and it just floats in the it's ugh and that's really not necessary
it really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so I'm excited about the recycling program in plano I can't wait for them to get it started because it'll be that much easier for us
like I said now we have to take it over to wal mart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up
it's convenient out here for them to do it
what do they pick up? it's just
they pick up the plastic the glass and the newspaper they do?
and do you have to sort that? and they will do the or do you just put it all in
you just put it in the one bin and I guess they do the sorting but they'll do the aluminum cans too but we don't give them those the kids keep those so so you're doing that now? you're doing the newspapers and the glass?
we don't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home to read it
so we don't have the newspapers but the plastic and the glass at first when it first started it was hard because you're just used to throwing things my husband would come home and go through the trash and say you threw this away
he would get all upset and I'd say it's just such an automatic reaction and now we think before we throw anything away
it is it's really funny we really once you get into the habit of it it's okay it's just making it a habit that's hard
I know the kids have even got to the point where if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can they're don't do that and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain and then after a couple of days they take them all outside
and I put them in a big bag anyway
and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them so that's their activity thing to go out there and crush that's fun that's a lot of fun
that's a lot of fun that's great I'm to hear you're doing that I my sister was here recently from connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans
what have you seen? the latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was dances with wolves
that's I knew you were going to say that I want to go see that
I just finally ended up going to see it and one day my husband had the kids and I just went because we could never get to go see it together because it's so long by the time we had a babysitter for that long
so I finally just went to see it and I just thought it was fantastic
I watched costner on the academy awards I was really happy that he got I was hoping he was going to get best actor
but he did pretty good on that one that was quite a the buffalo scene in that thing was so real
it's like it just blew me away I bet
there're several of them that are out right now that I want to see dances silence of the lambs
I'm afraid to go see that one that one looks so scary just from the previews
I thought I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months
it's supposed to be good though
that's what people said I know some friends who went to see it
they said it was really riveting
that's what they said about the exorcist it's terrible you'll have nightmares I watched last weekend me and my roommate we laughed about it you're not a thirteen year old I don't know I saw it when I was a kid and I thought
I'll tell I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie
and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was
he's a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene it was
and of course I was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and you start hearing noises call the crisis line I bet
and there's rats in the attic
let's see there was a couple of others that are out
and I can't remember I saw one I thought was crummy with that new michael j fox movie the hard way where he plays a actor that's
I didn't even like the previews on that I know it was I ended up at the theater and there didn't seem to be anything else on I wanted to see so I'll try that but it wasn't worth anything I didn't care for that at all
I don't much care for michael j fox anyway the last two I saw him in one of those back to the future part three deals that was crummy also I didn't think that was any good so
I saw the original back to the future and then I know I hardly ever go see a sequel
I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one
two thousand and ten was far better
two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book I hadn't read it and I couldn't figure what was going on half the time so
nobody could figure it out the book was so much
there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures
a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you say what is this?
what's the significance of the apes I should probably go back and read the book now that I just saw the movie again not too long ago
the book is really good I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again and that's one of them
it's so well written I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids otis and milo
you're right I haven't that is the most precious movie it has to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life and it's all this it's the story of this little cat and dog and it's not cutesy it's just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things
those and it was a real dog and cat a real dog and cat?
and all the other animals they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised and then the cat gets on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up all over creation I don't know where in the world it is somewhere in china somewhere I think that it was filmed
but it's just really an incredible thing
sounds sort of like the incredible journey it was pretty wild and of course the only sound is dudley moore narrates it
but there's nothing else to keep it going but it really keeps me going
I've seen it twice now
that sounds a lot like a walt disney film
sounds a lot like a walt disney film it was like the best of the walt disney ones walt disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years
not anymore I was raised on walt disney films
old yeller big red all those old good ones that you wish they had on more now but
when I was a little kid I saw the incredible journey on christmas eve and it was so good that I had forgotten that it was christmas eve
that's something for a kid that's pretty good
and that was something for greedy old me at christmas time I'll tell you let's see what are some other ones I've seen lately I'm trying to remember I can't I just saw one on the video have you seen the gods must be crazy part two? that is a riot
is it? the first one was really good but the second one is really good too I was really surprised
I didn't much care for the first one maybe that's I thought it was funny but that's my sense of humor
I'll have to go get that one I guess it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and I guess I'm just middle america or something I just go to be entertained and and not really interested in the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger stuff it's it's I just
I get so tired of these sequels number nine number ten number fourteen freddy's revenge part twenty five or whatever I've never
freddy eats a nuclear warhead I'm just I'm so sick and tired of that
I just can't believe it it's like rocky films I haven't seen a one I've never seen any of those
I can't stand stallone I can't either he seems so macho I just
and I was afraid that rambo was going to do the same thing that rocky was going to do go into fourteen hundred episodes
I hardly ever watch t v if I ever get the hankering to see something I've got maybe about thirty or forty movies and I just when they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can
I don't even rent them you don't?
I figure if I find a movie I like I'll buy it cause I just watch them over and over again that's like my husband does that he can watch them over and over
I and I'm there's very few I would want to see that many times so once he has one he likes to watch it over and over
my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is excalibur that was a good one I haven't seen that one in a long time
I loved that film it's just so well done
and I lived over in england for four years
that was the first place I ever saw it
and it was just it was so good
it was filmed in ireland
and they got pretty scenery in ireland I bet it's nice
and I've been down to the south of england where supposedly king arthur's castle was so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
it was unimpressive to look at the whole thing was about the size of a medium house it wasn't when I was in england years ago and I went to shakespeare's and stratford on avon and all that
and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short
the ceilings were so short but
there's some nice stuff over there to see
I spent four years traveling around and didn't see hardly anything I just I need to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel go around all the places
stonehenge of course everybody makes the obligatory trip to stonehenge
big deal here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field it's boring did you see any movies over there? I remember I went to see don quixote over there when it came out it came out right around the time with sophia loren and that was a riot to see that
you know something come to think of it I don't think I went to the movies one time cause when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie
I where I lived it was a little town called newmarket about seventy miles north of london
and there was another town called barry saint edmunds about twenty miles away from us
and they had a little theater company there and we use to go out to that about once a week
a really nice place amateurs but really quite good
but that was interesting course go to london quite a lot and see shows down there that sounds great
but other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies
never anyway anything that I ever wanted I rented a lot of videos
cause the closest movie theater was barry saint edmunds and who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies probably some of them did a lot of people did
but it would have to be a good show it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore
because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by
I they have all these neat phrases like critically acclaimed
that's what they when the thing hasn't won any award I see
they can't it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're two miles away from water
from love canal water view
waterfront property here at love canal
but critically acclaimed give me a break
that's there's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies
and primarily I'm probably going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
the last movie that I saw I don't go to that many so I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see but it was awakenings with robin williams and peter deniro have you seen it
unfortunately I haven't I heard it's really good but it is I just have to take my hat off to peter deniro
he is one of the best actors I've ever seen it's there's a point where the show is about these catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living more or less but it wears off
and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic it starts off with a tic
and then it gets to where he can't control his movements at all and it was just so realistic the way you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor
what is robin williams does he have a funny part in it? it was very
how does he do serious he's good he's talented he is
I've only seen him in funny stuff and so I know me too but what was that show I want to say garfield but that wasn't it
the world according to garp the world according to garp he wasn't always funny in that show was he
I didn't see the movie I read the book but I I did too that's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part
in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so what have you seen?
I think the last movie that we went out to see was dances with wolves I saw it
we've both seen one did you cry through it? the whole way
it was telling a friend I said I only cried twice but each was about half an hour long where did you cry
let's see each time that I thought that the indians were going to get killed I cried
I cried the first time when the wagon man got killed when they attacked him
and I think from there on all the way through the movie let's see what else did it what other parts I can't remember any of the other parts right off now I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed
I don't remember when the horse got killed when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him
and then the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards
and that horse has been such a pal to him when he was alone
you can tell I'm an animal lover you can hear my dog
unfortunately we don't have any animals so it was a beautiful story it really was
it there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie
what did you think about the buffalo scenes I thought it was awful and so graphic that was
I hadn't even imagined it I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo
I had a friend who had fixed some buffalo chili about a week before went to see the movie
of course they raise them now to eat
it's not but we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that
at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in it wasn't
I thought the scenes when the buffalos running though were beautiful that was great
and there were so many of them I didn't know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place
that was pretty and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you could follow this beaten down path
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing I wonder how they kept up with them though it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast I know
I guess they graze though that wouldn't be a problem have you seen any of the behind the scenes of that movie
it was they tried to keep it very close to real
kevin costner did all of his own scenes and they had to teach a wolf how to howl
that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves
I guess they're just not domesticated or what they just don't howl that much anymore
that'll teach them in a couple minutes I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that's all they'd have to do
that's funny I think we've made it
is that five minutes is that I don't know is it five or three
I'm not sure I'm not either
I think we've done okay though me too
thank you for calling thank you
and I hope you enjoy some more good movies you too
I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years our total tax burden despite tax cuts
but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in the world and in of the matter you get what you pay for if we're going to have national health insurance which seems likely it's necessarily going to involve more taxes I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look
I guess I kind of have mixed feelings you always sit there and out of each pay check so much comes out of it and you wonder where's it all going where's it all going?
and we have such a huge national deficit and I guess a lot of times there's questions wondering if it's doing a whole lot of good I know there's a lot of social programs out there that need help but you kind of always wonder where's the money going? one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into a big trust fund
but that is a particularly regressive tax it's a tax on the first dollar earnings and senator moynihan's proposal to cut there makes a lot of sense
I'm sorry I couldn't I think senator moynihan's proposal to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to beef up the social security program could make a lot of sense
I agree with that as far as other countries I don't keep up on it too much as far as what they're I know we were in ireland last year
and I know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here but as far as other countries I'm not up to par on
I think japan is probably about equal to ours
and other major countries are higher our friends were amazed that the cost of things when they went to canada not so long ago
and as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services and it's a real
they're real trade offs there
and you sit there and wonder I guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general and wondering if you're going to have enough when you retire to live on I that's a scary thing that there's no real knowing about there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans
that's true but are you involved with the legislature up there or which I'm at the national institute of standards and technology part of the commerce department here in gaithersburg maryland
I was just wondering since you said washington d c and you picked this topic I was just kind of curious I didn't pick it
you didn't I don't really recall I may have filled out on the form but I certainly have the feeling I've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before
did you I haven't placed any calls did they automatically assign the topic? when you place a call topic is given to you I didn't know that
I thought whoever made the call could choose what topic because I haven't made any calls yet I've just received some you should try it
I didn't realize that because it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you're talking to many of the subjects are taxes especially one thing that has kept our tax burden high is the level of the defense budget
and that same subject
have you painted something lately?
I have that room I showed you
and then since then we have painted the bedroom another bedroom
I showed you that one too didn't I? the brown one
the one that looks like a fudgesicle
I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom
but I have that problem with the ceiling the blown ceiling where you get around the edge
that is hard I asked janice or somebody recently how you do that when you paint the ceilings where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with
how do you get the edge though?
how do you get the edge? the straight edge?
you just have to be real careful I see
we use a two inch brush on a slant
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes but are you going to paint the outside of your house too?
I think I am going to do it this spring actually
there are six houses the people that own the house they pay for anything like that that we do as far as the materials nice
there are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses
so I am thinking I am going to change it to something the brick is multi color mostly earth tones
I think I am going to put something like a brown on it on the outside and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little that will be nice
what color did you paint or two tone
there are some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house? white on the out but I have a problem I can't get up high and we can't paint the chimney
you have got to get one of those ladders we have one of those ladders we are just not willing to get up that high
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house and that is what he I was out there last week and he has finished everything except the chimney we did too we did it in the fall and it's just too high it is really scary and the only thing I would consider a professional maybe doing that
but it other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional
our house in new mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
so I hired this man to come in and do it a young kid
and he came with his own what do you call those things? the blowers?
those where you built a rafter thing I know what you are talking about scaffold scaffold that's it
he came and did it that way and I think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up and literally I wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that I had left for him were above huge humongous cactus it's
and if he fell he was dead and he knew that so so that was worth it getting a professional for that
plus he cleaned up my mess I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself
it wasn't too bad you think
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside? maybe a hundred and fifty
since it is a one story but we did two heavy coats over it but then that way you are assured you did a good job than you are if you hire someone to do it
but that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to buy his paint
and yet he bought seventeen gallons
and anyway when he checked out they only charged him for one gallon of paint thirteen bucks or something
and he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
so she had to start all over again
and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was thirteen ninety nine or something and he saw so that was really worth it painting his own house
it was over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff
he really saved in that way
but I think we are going to do another bathroom but I think I will probably just do it in a roller I want to do it about the same color and just be a little
rollers are so messy we never any more I know but it's the textured wall a little paintbrush how big is provo?
that a little town or a bigger city?
it's not one of the bigger ones it's probably I compare it to the size of plano maybe a little smaller plano texas I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town I think
I forgot the name of the town I thought maybe it was you
we're supposed to talk about education I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college I'd say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic in grade school
because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to and it shows up that's one idea do you have any?
I don't know I think I'm pretty satisfied with I grew up in plano
and my dad is actually on the school board there so I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on it's plano improved greatly in the last twenty twenty five years
that's for sure it used to be the pits and arlington is excellent now but I'm just speaking overall across the country
something is definitely wrong
and one thing they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year and they truly can't read
so I don't know how they expect them to pass history when they can't read anything even read a word problem in math so that's definitely a problem another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do but
so what do you think is good about the schools? that is good about it depends on where you are they're all so different that's another thing about the united states
there's no national curriculum what they'd be teaching in an arlington school they may not be teaching in a plano school
and in the same school district even in an arlington seventh grade for instance you may have an english class you may have half literature for the whole year whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature
grammar it's up to the teacher in other words so that's kind of odd to me
it depends on what school you're in and who your teacher is actually
or is how you end up overall arlington is good one of the better ones in the state so I guess we lucked out when we moved here
so that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you of course we have a slight problem in that the number of the illiterate in america is mushrooming at this point and where our kids might be in a great school we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read so
but do you think that there should be nationwide curriculum? I don't know I just read about that the other day and I had never even thought of it actually it makes sense to a certain extent because sometimes a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach according to her plan
so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn
but we actually rank forty ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes
that's pretty low that there's forty eight countries ahead of us that have more citizens percentage wise that can read and write
so unless we want to keep paying for these people that can't make it in society we're going to have to do something
who do you think it should be done through? I don't know obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet so I probably can't but I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write
because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays
you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something or fill out an application to work at mcdonalds if you can't read
so I think that's a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades
and they say that the average english student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago and that's a big jump I believe that did you go to school in plano? I did through high school
do you do a lot of dining out? we don't although we enjoy it we do it more when we have company come what about you?
we do some dining out I do a lot of cooking so mostly when we go out it's my husband and I we don't go out too often as a family unless it's a fast food kind of thing but we do enjoy dining out one of our favorite places here in the dallas area is atlantic cafe I don't know if you have you ever been there? I've heard of that but I haven't been there where about is that?
actually there's the atlantic cafe and cafe pacific and I've been to cafe pacific
have you? that's down in highland park
it's highland park village did you like it?
I love it before we moved to the area my brother lived in dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and we all ate there
and their seafood was wonderful
it's fabulous it really is a great place where is the atlantic cafe?
I believe it's on mckinney
and originally the guy who owns the cafe pacific and the guy who owns the atlantic cafe were partners in the atlantic cafe and then they separated and the guy started cafe pacific and I loved them both I really do I think they're wonderful that's our favorite what we'd really like if we just have a casual evening is houston's have you been there? but I've heard that's really good too and
it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have to expect to wait at least an hour
so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there for an hour waiting to get in and as long as you know that it's okay but they have just about the best prime rib anywhere in the area I love it and my husband really likes their ribs so it's hysterical we go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't even look at the menu you know right away what you want
I know right away what we want we really enjoy prime rib too and actually the steak and ale out here we've gone to my in laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on sunday monday or tuesday night
and the time we went the prime rib was really good
was it? I've been there for lunch
but I've never been there for dinner and it was good
that's great that's great
another nice place for prime rib is baby doe's I've heard about that too
maxwell's nice have you been there? but I guess we eat out even less than I realize
and I didn't think we ate out very often baby doe's is nice
and one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to is lawry's I've heard that's real good lawry's prime rib?
I had heard that too
I've never been there but I've heard it's real good have you been to the cafe de france right here on central expressway?
actually they have one in richardson that I've been to
they have real nice lunches have you been there for lunch? or
primarily lunch and breakfast sometimes but during the week they often have a limited menu choice but very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
and the my husband and I like veal a lot
and their veal dishes have been good we've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the the specials have you ever been to biffin's?
I keep hearing about it I keep hearing the advertisements of it I
and they keep saying it's wonderful it's wonderful I have not been over there and I was thinking it's supposed to be a family place over near plano super bowl and
and I've not been there I haven't either one place and I've only been there for lunch but I went with a friend and we met her husband down on greenville down near the highway twelve area is gershwin's
I've been there we just
that was nice it was and we both enjoy mushroom soup
and linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert which was a chocolate sack
I don't know if you tried or
I've heard of it where it's made it's like a it's all chocolate made like a paper bag
and it's filled with whip cream and strawberries and something? it had a sponge cake and whip cream
and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry puree
and we shared one the three of us
and it was plenty because it was very rich but I wished I'd had a camera it was beautiful
I bet it was I bet it was
the last time we went to cafe pacific it was father's day and we took another friend with us
and for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves and so they had a berry assortment it was raspberries and blueberries and strawberries on a plate with a custard on the bottom
and they did the raspberry puree just kind of in a decoration on the you know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it sounds wonderful
it was really relatively simple but it was good it was really good that's one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant I love fresh berries and their fruits are always exceptional I don't know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer's market you can't find them like that you can't find them and
I'm originally from connecticut and I was home a few years ago and my sister and brother in law were going to take us out for dinner and I was really amazed the restaurants up there were kind of quaint they were real real pretty but they lacked the service and they lacked just the I don't know the restaurants down here seem like they have I guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good
and I thought I would really miss that I would too because we don't go out very often
when we do go out in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess and it's a whole experience of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service are important too
and in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good
because the ones that aren't so good just don't make it that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful it's called cafe max and it's at plano road and campbell they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three
short term I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it
are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?
the short term the recession is getting top attention I think that you're absolutely right there the other thing is is that we've got all these bank defaults going on and savings and loan defaults and
and that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not
and that's got to be paid so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come I'm not really sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if they're talking about reducing the tax that needs to be paid or the tax that's currently being paid then it seems to me it can't possibly help with the deficit picture
it can only hurt the deficit picture
and the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without bringing on serious problems for the longer term
so that's the current predicament it seems like it's a kind of a catch twenty two it's the my understanding is what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend and if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity which in turn will generate revenue but it seems like it's sort of an unending spiral and it I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the idea that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye bye the bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to result in substantial amounts of money for consumers to spend and
I'm not sure how I feel about paying on the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point it's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do
first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates
I think that's been a positive development I think what that's done is it's help keep inflation from
at the moment we're doing very well on inflation that's the sort of upside to the deficit it's a sort of a piece of luck
that's the upside to the recession I don't know what kind of things do you think can be done in the long term?
can be done or will be done are two different things at various places to look for cutting the budget first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation
but there are various other areas such as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed a lot of entitlement programs like education aid I think they should put in the reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class
in the longer term we'd do well to make reductions there also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed I think that I agree with you certainly in the second situation and I think certain entitlements I'm inclined to agree with you too education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to
a lot of education aid has gone to so called trade schools which are sort of not colleges
but schools that teach you trades beautician often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition and the school gets paid off immediately I see what you're saying
and then the people default on the loans and then they don't provide very much education
I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that around and I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing but taking what you're saying at face value then I would have to agree with completely
personally I don't have any children I'm twenty two and I'm doing my master's at n c state
so children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now
would they how do you spend the time with your children?
both of mine are boys they're eight and eleven and did
and they're into sports
as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight what are you doing?
baseball has started does the eight year old play baseball?
we start here at five and in his league do they have a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what?
up until it's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in may
so he's going to be with regular pitching
and my eleven year old of course is pitching I used to play soccer when I was that age up in new york so
but we're into baseball and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball we even have peewee basketball here
there's always something and how about on the weekends do you do sports or do you go out?
both if we're not doing sports we go somewhere do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off?
in the summer or in the easter time around now?
usually in the summer time and where do you go?
different places every year we have you been out of the country?
first they always say get to know your country first before you leave I lived in places like
when I lived in washington d c I never went to the washington memorial and then when I went back to visit I went to the washington memorial
I've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often and that must be the thing they really hadn't either they went to the memorial when they go it's on business
it's not really just getting to sight see it's a beautiful city
I bet it is too but the problem is first time I went out of here they took me to las vegas
and that was the most boring place on earth
my husband and I we go different places but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close did you go to disneyland?
but now I don't know but let's see when I was eleven I went also to the caribbean
that was fun that was and then after that I my sister lives in turkey so when I was fourteen fifteen I went to turkey
and this christmas I went to turkey but basically it's a for the past couple of years I since my parents are I'm from argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling I do is alone
and we were never much of a very family thing made go skiing in vermont or something
that was a lot of fun
but what happens is we used to fight a lot so there's never much of a family thing one of those hell family vacations
but I try my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does
because my dad died when I was less than a year old
so I always just had a mother so I always thought when I have kids I really want to be involved with them my dad all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things
material things that is and to me it's now I'm twenty two but I still feel it's we never threw a football or something
and the way I was brought up and he wants me now he wants to be best friends now
best friends now and it's very hard for me because it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man
and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old and he wants to be best friends
but it's I can only express myself so much because everything that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say I'm sorry it's I love you and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it
and so that's that whole thing that he'll say when I've seen my uncle and his family does everything together and his kids are when his little girl was five years old and everything they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning
and I was brought up the same way it doesn't matter what age you have just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up
but what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house you have to
you honestly do I have friends that I love to death and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them to do it
and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying I work full time too but it's just something that my theory is when you have kids and all you want to do what I'll do is you might have problems but it's not your kids problems
and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to thing is that if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying I got a problem
problem and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time
first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem and that's very hard to do because once you're best friends with your parents then I think everything go a lot better
I agree with you very much so we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew time wise and money wise too
it would not have been a good idea to had them then my father was raising three kids before he had me so it was you're trying to support four kids and it's pretty hard
and I told him you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids
he says yeah but then I wouldn't have you I go yeah but then you would have a lot of money
that's right but you can't take this money with us though
that's how I keep looking at it but four children is expensive especially for me which I'm paying out of state tuition I'm paying three thousand what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester
and people say it's expensive to think it's college but if everybody would be a little bit responsible it's what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester they go to a state college and they live at home
and it costs two hundred dollars for books but seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead
if you can it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college
what are you learning to be? excuse me?
what are you wanting to do after you get out of college? I'm doing computer engineering
that's my husband's into computers and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home
because since I'm an international student they want to send me back to argentina
my dad wants me to go back so
and you don't want to?
because if you go back there then you can never get out
you don't have any money to get out
and I was thinking I go back there and I get married there and now I have kids there and then I'll never leave the place
then you'll never leave I know and that's what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain so
maybe something will open up for you I've been calling a lot of companies there some of them are interested at least for a year and a half I can work so
I've enjoyed talking to you same here where do you live? in plano
in plano? where do you live? in dallas
the air pollution isn't too bad in our area so we're very fortunate but I know in some areas it really is bad
I was trying to think something we were watching the other day and they were doing an overview of los angeles from an area that was up higher and you literally could see the band of smog that I've never been out there but it was quite evident that it was a real brown area I haven't either and
I think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately I think there are a lot of areas that are that bad
particularly in the areas where there are industries where they are burning a lot of coal and oil more up north I guess
I think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution anti pollution devices I think air isn't as bad it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area I know that's been the concern in europe they hadn't we have friends in germany and have family that live near the black forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we switched to the unleaded gas and had the emission control devices required on the cars that's something that europe didn't do right away and now they're doing that and I guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there it's not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of trees and a lot of
from acid rain? I guess from something that the car was giving
I think in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere and form a weak acid and
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time I think that accumulates in trees because they take it up through their roots as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad
what's interesting several years ago I took a course on it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was and there wasn't from various kinds of energy and at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh poohed you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing and it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage so it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear I'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that they use is not bomb quality and we're so strict with all our controls in the united states the chances of an accident are slight and it doesn't pollute the air at all it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants it's kind of funny because people are just petrified at the thought of nuclear
so I don't know in europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become bomb quality but that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as I'm concerned where it could eventually pollute the groundwater so I don't know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or fusion or something clean
we've got a problem on the line don't we I get that sometimes my line gets some static I don't know why
but solar of course would be the cleanest I know it's
we did have a solar water heater when we lived in houston and oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal
I can't hear you at all for all this static I don't know what to usually it's the other phone I have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me? now I can again
I don't know what the problem is but when we lived in houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
and we have enough clouds that there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because I think we have a tremendous amount of sunny days
and it it can be used and it can help but that was a problem that they were still working on but
it's still got a long way to go I
it's just a possible solution in the future maybe to help in some ways
it may not in all ways maybe they'll come up with fusion be able to control it I don't know how long that'll take but one of these days because that's perfectly clean
it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isn't not at all and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so that's not going to work at least not now but who knows what the future will hold as far as energy goes I think with solving some of the future energy problems we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well I hope so
I do to I like to be optimistic I don't like to be pessimistic about these things I do think you've already mentioned several things just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in
we have one earth to live on
and we got to take care of it and for the future generations too
I've noticed students are much more young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth
and so if we can raise generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems I'm afraid I know I was part of the me generation where people didn't care it's whatever recycle if it's a problem forget that not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away? how horrible
I've always done those kinds of things because I just didn't like messes and
this is the season for vacations and I guess for places I like to go I enjoy going to the beach and being outdoors somewhere someplace that's very different than texas
and I maybe as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot and being able to be outside enjoy outside activities so
enjoy going places where I enjoy playing tennis so I like to have a tennis court there or if it's at the beach the beach is great a pool is great and I
where do you usually go? let's see we have plans this year to drive up to colorado
and we will be going to estes park and colorado springs so
one year we went to the southwest corner of colorado into durango and north of the area there
and I that's a nice place to visit it's really nice at there's a nice nice train ride that goes up to the city of silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining
and then actually north of that is another town on a smaller scale than silverton and then there's lots and lots of mountains that are covered with boulders
so I guess people jeep through that area and we did not have a chance to do that but I sure would like to go back there and do that again
we have not had a vacation in several years so be our first chance in awhile we are going to go to destin florida which is a very nice beach area if you are not familiar with it I have not been but I have heard it's wonderful
it's gorgeous we used to go quite a bit before I moved out here we were closer and used to go almost every summer and rent a condo there on the beach there's a lot of development of condominiums there on the beach front
so they are very very large condos and they have quite a few rooms so we will usually rent one for about a week or so and and the beach is nice go down
the beach is really nice isn't it
it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a lot of nice waves usually sea shells
enough to make it I am sorry sea shells
there's not as many sea shells along there that's the only thing that they really do not they have some but not so much
if you go further down you will usually find some but not right in there I do not know why it is but it just it seems not to have as many right there but we enjoy it it's we usually stay at the same place every year and they are like I say right on the beach so where do you stay? my husband always wants to go to destin we just have not gone that direction yet
it's a place called jetty east j e t t y e a s t and it's called that because it's at the very end of a jetty there which is sort of at the end of this little little point
and it's at the very end it's the last set of condominiums there and it's very nice it's not very expensive you can I think we are going to go with another couple and their kids and we have a three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep quite a few about six or eight cause it's got pull out couches and all that
and I think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week that's nice
it really is because it has got its own full size kitchen and everything
and this one has two baths and it's the one we got is on the beach side so
we have got a beautiful view and balcony and just it's really a nice stay in fact we stayed there on our honeymoon I had won a trip to the bahamas but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time so we instead went there and loved it just as much as if we had gone to the bahamas in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked
the particular suite we had gotten was very nice and so we decided to stay
but it's a pretty nice place you will need to try to go and stay there sometime we have just
it's a little far from here but are you driving?
we are we are it will take a day and a half to get there probably
so we are the neighborhood that we live they are switching to an alternate calendar this year so it starting at the end of july we will have two vacation weeks in october and two vacation weeks in march
so that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family so I
what does that mean alternate? it's what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation
and in the summer would be more like a two month break
and they hope to boost the learning of the children just the retention of the material for them I see so
kind of scattering the vacation throughout the year
so it's anyway so maybe within a year we will see how that falls
we will head for florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer
that's probably all we need to do today thanks a lot
what kind of car are you thinking of buying next?
more than likely it's going to be a chrysler you like the chrysler products do you?
chrysler lebaron it won't be a ford I've got a ford mustang now and I hate it do you really? what year is it? it's a eighty eight and why don't you like the mustang?
it's I've had one problem with it after the other I'll be darned
the paint's peeling off of it and there's no reason for it fix or repair daily or find them road dead you know the old sayings about fords what they stand for there you go
that I it's my electrical system shorted out like two or three times and it's been torn up since april and luckily everything was under warranty so it's only costing a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed it would have been two thousand we've always had oldsmobiles and been very happy with oldsmobiles but my wife thought she wanted to get a ford mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those mitsubishi eclipses she likes those
those are nice cars she has a sister that lives in phoenix that has one and really enjoys it what things do you consider when you buy a car?
the gas mileage for one thing and I've always had stick shift the next car I get I want it to be automatic I see
I hate driving anyway and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now especially when you're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time
and when you work nine to five or eight to five and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately that makes it very frustrating
and I look and one of the things with chrysler right now is the warranties that they have and I feel like their everybody I've talked to that owns one has been real pleased with it and I like the driver's air bag I like that this is a lebaron?
all chrysler products has it in there but lebaron would be the next car I get I sure like those rag top lebarons they really look sporty
I like that too but I couldn't afford the insurance on one of those we always this last oldsmobile we bought it's an eighty seven but we bought it in eighty eight right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them
and we found a real good interest rate when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices and we looked around at used cars and we really couldn't afford the payments on a used car because if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent and we ended up with a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and the payments
that's what I'm paying on mine now I had to get a first time my dad's always cosigned on my loans or whatever and this is one when I bought I got my mustang this time by myself because I got on my own or whatever and I had said they said it had to be a first time buyer's car or whatever and they're charging me unreasonable interest but I've got eight more payments and it's paid for that's great
but I got it when the eighty eights first came out it's a good car I got in eighty seven in november or something like that and when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door our first car was an oldsmobile back in seventy seven it was a two door cutlass supreme and it just happened that when we looked for our new car they had a thing going with oldsmobile and if you'd buy a new oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate because it was their seventy fifth anniversary
I seventy fifth anniversary so in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them our papers on our first car and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it so we got a four door this time and I sort of went more for the comfort factor and I liked the smaller cars but I'm a bigger person and I really like comfort driving along the road and stuff
that's another big factor of mine next car I get's going to be a four door too something with some room
because my mustang is two door with bucket seats and you buy groceries and stuff like that and if you try to take anybody go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome
are you a freshwater or mostly freshwater I
freshwater I used to fish when I was real young down in galveston with my parents and I never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything and I didn't know anybody who had a boat so I don't fish too much in saltwater
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish
and I have caught one or two small sharks
and what'd you do with them? put them back you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do?
I love shark steak but the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything do they have a limit on sharks is that a sport fish can you actually catch those and there's no limit
is there a limit? I have no idea I know I my home is in pensacola florida
so they do a lot of shark fishing in the gulf
and there's a certain period of time during the year all along the gulf coast from galveston to mayport they have shark tournaments and there either as part of or separate from the bill fishing tournaments they usually have so I have not done much lake fishing for bass and so forth but maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things but nothing
I think I've been trout fishing once I've never fly fished have you fly fished? I haven't I don't know that I could do that that looks awful tiring I've tried it once did you
a friend of mine didn't like it? I could never get the hang of it it looks complicated to me it's a rhythm or something
I usually ended snagging my fishing partners or the trees along the bank catching tree bass
almost got an owl once did you that would have been something
but do you fish mainly for trophies or do you eat what you fish
when I was working in florida I used to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation
there are people who fish and then there are people who catch
I'm a fisher you just like to sit down and watch it
that's right I've never caught that much but
and occasionally we'd go out on a full day trip three or four other people and do either again bottom fishing or for grouper
or I've caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth that's nice
what about you a most of my fishing is done at area lakes around here freshwater lakes
and most of it I haven't been really in a long time last time I went I actually was in galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun
but I went fishing at lake worth it's a fairly new lake in texas
and we went fishing there last memorial day and I caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep I was so excited and that's really about it mostly just the lakes around here and I fish to take home and cook
I don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching I get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly I want to say I brought something home I want to say I did this I was out there for a reason
the last time I went bass fishing I was with my daughter a friend of hers and a friend of mine and his daughter I was the only one who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish everybody but you
I did not even I was out on a party boat a few years ago and we were grouper fishing or actually we were snapper fishing everyone on the boat was catching snappers except guess who it had to be you
I couldn't catch one to save your life
that's right I would go from one side of the boat to the other and the party boat captain could not understand
even he started baiting my hook and holding the fishing rod how funny just hoping maybe he could pull
and it was really really really bad as I said I am a fisher I'm not a catcher
but I enjoy it though I don't really get out as much as I would like too
and they do of course here in we're forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland
and they do a lot of fishing there of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or for oysters that would be fun
and that I was able to do when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom hand picked
that right the weirdest fishing experience I ever had people to this day are still trying to figure out if I really caught what I think I caught we were in rockport which is close to corpus
and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area and we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab so I got my chicken and all my little net and everything and something I had a rock to weight it down something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish
I'm sure it's not a fish and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so I netted it and it was the ugliest fish I've ever seen in my life it had real teeth like human teeth and it looked archaic I had no idea what it was I called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in its mouth not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed
they say it's a dog fish from everything I've described it was brown with these little white dots
and it made a loud almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
it was the strangest thing I'll never get over that to this day I don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because I'm sure one of those fish are there
we used to I guess the weirdest thing I've ever caught is in some of the inlets and the rivers around delaware they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker I don't know if you've ever heard of it I've never heard of that one
and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually use their teeth to open oysters that's where it gets its name obviously
and this is the ugliest fish I have ever seen
and they come in all I've caught them from three or four inches long up to
I guess the largest one I ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible can you eat them?
I don't think I'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but
they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them that's like this dog fish it scared me to death
it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
the first time I went surf fishing was in and I threw my line out and the first thing I caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or two feet long
and scared me to death
I had never seen anything and then I fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth and then I felt something relatively heavy and I thought here I'm really going to get one and I do you have any particular thoughts about the school system?
I think that in recently with the I'm not sure if it's more a problem with american families or a problem with the school system they seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems any problems that a child might have whether it's actually a school related thing or not and I
I agree with you a hundred percent there
and it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything
if you've some kid who doesn't have who's from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void it's gotten way beyond teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something were kind of traditionally the school's roles
it's interesting because we're just having conversation on this with a couple of people yesterday and I was expressing my frustrations that so many problems are that kids don't have a degree of self discipline which may be reflected in society at large and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home
and it's seen more so because when you call parents up many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say my kid I've never heard anything about this before this is the first time there have been problems and you wonder don't these parents know that teachers talk and we do check with other teachers and other teachers find the same things in this child
and how do you tell the parent wake up and smell the coffee
but it is a problem and I'm not sure just how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it
whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems of society and that the school can only do so much on it
then again when you have a society where a certain percentage of the parents are doing drugs in the home either unemployed and have their own problems how do you expect the
you can't really expect that parent who's quite frankly a loser in life as it is to care about the situation with their child that's right
and you know what scares me too is that we have yet to see the biggest effect of the crack children in the school system
these are children that are born with low attention deficit
and what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system that's really scary
but I think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve and this is something that I see too many times students get diagnosed as slow learners and in fact they're not they're behavior problems
and so they get put in our school system in a class that's limited for skills children that really have to master skills
and that's not their problem at the same time I've seen we have an international population there's no bridge area for students coming out of the e s o l which is english for speakers of other languages program
the once they're past e s o l they get out they got thrown right into the total mainstream
and there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition for that
so the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes having slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems
and then the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated
and then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but they're discipline problems and you sometimes the average classes really are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there
the gifted and talented are fast classes there's really not that much of a problem with but it's
I've seen more incredibly intelligent underachievers than
I would take a person who's motivated and a little less intelligent than the person who is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of isn't motivated to do anything that's I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration
not to toot my own horn here or anything but I was graduated from my high school I was the valedictorian and I know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me
and they proved out late when it came time to take the s a t s mine were good
but they weren't great
and when I got into college I struggled just to get my degree in the field that I was in
whereas I knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all but they got motivated in college and they did a lot better than I did and when it I guess kids do mature at different ages too
that's and as a teacher you try to be understanding that there are different ages kids are is this a got a kid that just a question of maturity or is he a problem child
but teachers are asked to diagnose so much we're have to be we're alerted
there's all sorts of systems where suicide predisposition we're alerted to the moment we see something if we see a child that's on drugs such as if he's got a beeper or if they're flashing lots of money around there are certain things to do so the school system's asked to do so much but you can't operate in a vacuum
you actually have students with beepers? we're in a rather wealthy suburb of washington
and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the principal
where what are the what could they possibly be thinking how it's for drug use they can't imagine for anything else
it's amazing but you get all sorts of things in the schools and it's and as a teacher you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy you're alert to the kid who suddenly has a behavioral change and you refer them to the nurse
and you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason or whether this is a warning signal
how can you expect to and parents frequently resent when you ask them is there a problem that we should be aware of?
I was sitting in the barber shop I'm an officer in the air force and I was having my hair cut
and the barber got a call while I was there from his son's school his son's in high school and his son was failing gym and having trouble with a few other things
but this guy was there's no problem with my kid my kid's a great kid and all this the kid had missed all these classes and basically his answer was I gave him permission to miss
the denial mechanism is really strong and so many parents are facilitators
they're manipulated by their children
I've been fortunate I have a son who's a sophomore in college up in massachusetts at amherst
and my other son is a senior in high school and he's going on to williams and they're really super they're both national level swimmers
and we've been very fortunate but they had to be held accountable too
at some point a parent does help their kid in some ways but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative
and I think this is where the school system is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system
but it was good talking with you
it was good talking to you too so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do and are connected with the schools
I've had interesting conversations on several subjects not just this but the different things
it's amazing how the people you talk to have some interesting conversations and it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all we are though
that's true listen good luck take care
carol since today's subject is our homes why don't you tell me about yours
I live in plano in a four bedroom two bath house which is the area's dominantly three bedroom two bath so I'm just a little bit different than typical and of course the plano area is basically with alleyways so everything around here is set up that way which I think is a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way they're constructed and it's a brick house with some wood it's real nice I like it how about you? I certainly hope so we have a classic ranch up in denton ranch style home I would hate to think that anybody thought the lot we live on as a ranch it's in a subdivision and one story it started out life as a three bedroom house and now has no two car garage and has the two extra rooms enclosed I suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath? almost a hundred percent
I can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision ours is probably the closest to it you know how realtors are they'll say this could be five bedrooms if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house
to don't need a closet
the only thing about mine I think there's probably about when I go down the street I can just pick out houses that are identical to mine and usually they are the four bedroom but they're spaced out maybe three on a two block period because it's all different builders up here so it's kind of hard at that point to classify some of the builders but most of the builders all built three two but the one thing my house is a little bit different and I can pick it out again because it's not typical I've got the what do you call a double ceiling double high in one half of the house so the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings cathedral ceilings
and the kitchen is norm and the bedrooms are norm so it just goes down the dining room the family room and the living room that way and I love the space it's luckily I came from a house in colorado which had the cathedral ceiling and I just lucked out and walked into this one and of course I felt the same airy feeling which I liked it real well so it's a nice thing to move into but again it's not typical in this area you can just spot them because the roof is so much higher but I hadn't thought about it in that sense of the high roofs we have cathedral ceilings in two rooms in the family room and in the master bedroom and those are pleasant
it's like when my son goes up into the furnace area over the garage
he can walk and he's six foot and he says come on up mom I'm not going up there
I'm not going up there but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room so that means if I knock out the wall in my family room I could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem but I'm not that ambitious I maybe someday when I feel really ambitious and get angry I'll start poking holes up there but until that time but I've noticed the houses around here it's one story and they're all basically two bath with three bedrooms and we're I guess probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick with some wood
but it's basically all brick the next subdivision over from me is total brick and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine but the one on opposite the street they're total brick and they're basically almost all three two they're all three two but of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind of nice if it's the kind of river I'm thinking of better than us are you talking about a real river creek?
it's a creek they've put little fountains in and such that's nice I came from mississippi recently and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains and they didn't pay any attention to banks and that kind of stuff
so you're just as likely to wake up and discover you're in two inches of water
do you have a lot of yard around your house now in denton? it's a third of an acre I don't think that's a lot in fact I have been real disappointed in the six years that I've lived out here about lot sizes I'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have
when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost there's no lot line at all they're built practically on top of each other that's true
I know I was and while there are some advantages to that there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things I just feel hemmed in by that it's not as comfortable a living for me
this subdivision here has got there's enough to put twelve feet between each house on each side I've got more on one side than I've got on the other but I'm like you I came down from colorado and there was more land up there around a yard with a big full back yard which here I look out my back yard and I can see the gate the fence is right there just don't run too fast or you'll hit it and I'm not used to that either I could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me but to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard and you've lost your back yard
you've got a little place on one side or the other but to me they're not that big enough for a pool but they're going up but it's great for mowing from that aspect you're right and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff
but I'm used to walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but don't do it around here the one that's sort of what drove me to denton when I first came out here in eighty five
I started looking and it seemed like the further I got away from dallas center the more lot came with the house and the lower the price at the same time and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city
I hadn't thought about it that way so moving up thirty five I stopped when I got to denton
it with our jobs mainly hitting downtown dallas we couldn't go too much further but we went that way it was the schools and the cost of houses so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work and that's where we stopped it was the same problem but I think plano's you all both work downtown?
I got layed off by t I this is a wonderful thing that you're doing here still helping them out
I but you were working downtown
I was working at the dallas site my ex husband was working downtown
but t I as far as I concerned they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned so I have no problems but as far as the housing personally I would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller but prices in plano there isn't a section in plano you can really move to without getting caught and my price right now for what I pay
like I was saying burlington's crime it doesn't involve children and what you see on the t v s in washington and new york so what I believe the people want the subject is big city crime which is something that I don't have any first hand experiences about but I have concerns and I have a few ideas of how to combat it
I don't think ideally you need money to do everything so that's one thing
that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money so
when we lived in san antonio I grew up around san antonio and it's always been a very large city and increasingly growing it's has kind of the split population there's a lot of retired military individuals that live there and then there's a very large hispanic population there and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic gang crime in the city
and that has been the worse thing that we've seen happening does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the retired people's community or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods?
the majority of the actual gang crimes like the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies rape and car crime there's a very high percentage of car theft and san antonio's not far from the border to mexico so a lot of the cars go to shops and they take them apart and a lot of them go over the border especially mercedes a lot of those in the z cars the datsun cars end up over the border and so that's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up very much so
very much so in fact for a while there downtown if you were to come to a stop light they had a rash of when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up so now ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and once you've reached the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys or alone if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops it's very nice but at evening again they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage alone it sounds like san juan puerto rico we were there just for a lay over
and it wasn't a lay over we were staying at the other end of the island and we drove into san juan to catch our plane
it was at night and this boy really wanted to go on the beach and they look at you crazy
you don't go on the beach
it's a big tourist town don't people go for a walk on the beach at night? and they said no it's very safe in the daytime
but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary and get off the beach
it's just so sad it is just really so sad it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more in san antonio I don't know what the answer is education is a lot of it so many of the kids are drop outs there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels I think education helps a little bit there then again I don't know really what steps there are that they what they say they try to do is to get the kids early and young
and what we have here in burlington they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids
they set up kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program
they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer and they have gyms open and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them
but again you need that one on one like a big brother trying to tell him stay in school it'll get better so that your mom doesn't have a job
and she doesn't work you don't know you can be better than that you don't have to live for a street life but
that's good that sounds like they've got a lot going on there but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here they can deal with that scale
they might have five hundred troubled youths
when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into the kids now it's twelve years old and they're selling drugs
and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun
it's the morals of the people which I guess everybody's responsible for the society but if I had a child that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody
these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy
and we don't have it so we deserve it and we should take it
I don't know how you combat that I don't know where you start with a lot of these kids so many of them all they see is just the gangs
and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school I think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old
the parents might be thirty years old
and I'm thirty years old and I'm kind of irresponsible but I have the morals that keep me from if I was going to go out and drink or do something I wouldn't do it in front of my child these people they bring their johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room
it's just that they have absolutely no morals and it's really sad
and I don't know how you combat that I I don't know what the answer is to that problem but I like your idea of education
if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools
and what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then I feel for them I don't know how to make it better for them or because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say it's not acceptable I'm leaving the big city mom and I'm going off when they're ten they have to live in it and it's really sad if they did have a big brother big sister program
those people trying to help the kids the parents might have hostilities towards them like you're judging us
I think so and and I'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true
it's I'm glad I don't live in a big city not just because I wouldn't feel safe
it's just because that I would be reminded every day of something that I don't see
and I might see it on a sixty minutes special
in san antonio it was every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night I know it but san antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not
they have all kinds of nice write ups about it
but there's a lot of them but any big city has a bad section
it's very prevalent a lot of the crime is very prevalent they're very bold it seems
very much when we moved here to monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above carmel and there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed around here and those that aren't there's celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there migrant hispanic farm workers people that are down and out and they all seem to congregate in celinas not so much here in monterrey so it's pretty quiet we walk the streets at night and people run in the park and you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or even in the worst crime areas in burlington I can walk the streets I wouldn't if I did it every night I think there would be trouble in our house
so you wouldn't get confronted or anything
but I don't think you would someone might grab you mess around with you but they're not going to grab you steal your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities
that's what you're going to have to expect that to happen people are just totally unfeeling
I didn't know that about burlington I'll have to keep that in mind
so you said that you live in coppell
so what is your house like?
it's a two bedroom two baths duplex that's neat brick and is it one you're renting or buying?
we own it our side that's kind of neat that even though it's a duplex you can still buy that's good
do you have any children?
do you? I have two children and our home is really too small for us right now ours is too
we outgrew it when we moved in we moved from an apartment that was really small
and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old
so we moved into this house in garland it's in one of the older areas of town
and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere
lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty
but the house is real small
it has less than a thousand square feet it's real little
you all are cramped and now I have a daughter now the one that was five months old is seven years old
and I have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes and toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put
how many bedrooms is it? they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room
but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet
so the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom
but we have always just put our computer and extra toys and books and
it's kind of a catch all room but it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play
they all go out there to play with the barbies and that kind of stuff so
how fun that works out good
and I'm thankful I have two girls because they're in bunk beds and so they can share a room and make for more space that way and how old's the youngest? she's three and a half
and right now we have their clothes on double racks in the closet
we made a higher and a lower
and it works out fine but they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag
and we're going to have to figure out a new idea but we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so
so that would be nice
that's what we'd like to do is coppell a nice area to live?
it's a wonderful place to live and they I don't have any kids so I don't really know but they say that we have wonderful schools I think I've heard a lot about coppell schools that they're real good that's neat
do you hope to have children or are you not planning on having any or
I don't think so I see
do you have any pets?
of course those are my kids I have two dogs
do they stay inside or
they're inside dogs that's neat they're my babies
what are the colors in your house?
kind of a mauve and gray I bet that's pretty
and then the kitchen's kind of a country pink and country blue and it's all done in cows
I'm a cow nut that's neat I like cows too
our house was our house is very old also
it's thirty seven years old
and it was redone before we moved in which I'm thankful for that but the it was redone at the time when earth tones were in everything is
the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has paneling in the living room and lots of tans and lots of browns
but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that
so that's worked out good in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan wallpaper had done it up with blues so that's nice but
sounds pretty we've enjoyed living here
it's close to my oldest daughter's school
and that makes it really handy too
and she really likes her school so
and we are so close to shopping and
that's an important factor there how about in coppell? I've always imagined it kind of out away from everything
now we have that new mall in lewisville
and that's just a mile or two from our house that's nice
but when we first moved to coppell six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store
and now we have four
and coppell's not really big enough to support four grocery stores
but it does sound like it's definitely growing very much
in fact it's about the size now I moved down here from chicago twenty three years ago to lewisville
and coppell's now about the size that lewisville was when I moved down here I see
when we first moved here we moved here from lubbock
and we almost moved to lewisville that was our second choice behind garland
at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
how do you just figure
it depends upon our weather here today was a beautiful day it was like summer day it was seventy degrees so I dressed in a light weight skirt
it's a ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it
because I had some appointments at the office today some interviews and so I had to dress up anyway and then I wore heels
but when it rains a lot which is has been doing here a lot lately very often wear pants and boots
how do you dress? I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now
when I was a teacher in utah I would generally wear dresses and heels and things like that
and even when it rained and snowed I just braved it and I wore heels anyway and
I can see I've been a teacher so has my daughter and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring I know it might kill you to go up and walk up to the door that's right but you're going to look nice for the kids
that's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids? I need all the height I can get
I do too so to be taller than some of the boys in the older grades I had to wear heels
we too if it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots but then I would change into heels as soon as I got to my desk so
of course we wear an unlined boots it has a heel on it they're the kind of boots that I wear to work and we wear them they're a leather boot that you wear and as I said they have a regular heel on them high heel
and we wear them a lot with shirts and things it's kind of a I can't say constant down here in texas that you wear these boots they're not a cowboy boot but they're just a real pretty boot but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain
as I have a private high school that I run here when I'm interviewing a parent of course I feel like I need to wear heels and look like I'm a business person because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often
of course you probably wear coats a lot the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it so I did
so then you had to and then the third year we got heating so it was nice
then things improved
but of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot that's nice
and that's very seldom it depends upon our winter we have a few days you might wear a winter coat but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much we often laugh about even when it turns chilly we're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that
it's really different let's put it that way are you not teaching anymore? we moved to iowa and I'm working at a day care right now
I see and so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to twenty months
so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet I wear tennis shoes and jeans and things that are sort of
more practical not it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something
when you were teaching did you ever have a blue jean day or anything like that? but I never wore jeans because I thought that was too casual for
I know that some of the schools they have country western day or something like that one or tacky day and I always thought it got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too
it's all right for the students they look tacky a lot but I didn't think teachers should that's how I feel too
do you like iowa? there's some good things about it but I've seen a lot of things I'm not used to yet
where did you live before? we lived in utah before and I grew up in california
that's quite a change from california to utah
I'll let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours?
I never keep a budget my budget or philosophy is spend as little as possible that's good
and it's sort of always worked especially for these times
but that depends on the individual if they can have self control that's a lot of it I know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up I passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend
and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying
and then at the end of the pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment
and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about
and those are the ones that will kill you the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month
I couldn't probably be bothered doing that every month
and ever since that's what I mean it was a hassle
we've been married almost thirty years now but my husband got paid once a month
so you learn to get that's kind of hard
you learn to get through to the end of the month and but do you sort of self budget even you wouldn't on payday think I can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to
you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you?
because if you charge things you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid
or you get paid the last day or next to the last day
you pay all your bills and there isn't anything left to spend anyway that's true what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely
and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month we tried to
or we are paying them off now we're not there yet
there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off
but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is that's right that's right
and for most of I'm a substitute teacher and I've only substituted for the last fifteen years
so there's only been really one working same here
and it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people I could say it's kind of that's good you probably have a little extra than you have to have to you know what I'm saying?
and so that's the difference there where sometimes I know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday then I think if we could really budget we tried one I know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was going to be left
and that was a real eye opener
it is when you do it that way
but to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes I'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're going to spend going out for fun this is how much you're going to spend it's kind of hard
we eat out a good deal at this point do you?
I started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money because I knew that you couldn't spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever
we were going to go for ten weeks in nineteen eighty so I started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years how nice but the what minuscule amount I made but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card that's
and it was paid for and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably and so I think that that's difficult for most people but then my father was very scotch I think so too
and you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to so if you're out in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you?
that's excellent that's what I'm working toward I think you're probably much ahead of me there and I'm working on it
and I never worried about saving money because we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so same here same here
I and I think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get you know?
we never had too much of that
but then we never had any really emergencies that that came up
and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars I think the most we ever spent for a new car was six thousand dollars
and they were mainly used cars that's the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after so so
we've been rather frugal in that respect rather frugal that's going to payoff on retirement
it I guess we've completed do you think we've been here to
each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please how you doing?
fine I'm lee with I'm over here in plano texas
let me ask you something can I run a minute and shut my radio off?
where are you calling from or where are you at? arlington arlington texas arlington
there's a lot of stuff going on in arlington these days
not all good stuff are you involved in any of that?
I'm not personally what benefits do do you work?
I'm going to school right now you are?
I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think
I've got a lot of because I work for myself
and so there's a lot that I guess I do miss a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation I miss insurance and the steady paychecks that come but
I've been in my own business mary kay in fact I'm selling in out now to go to school full time and I enjoyed the freedom of having that is that right?
go to work when I wanted to or not
but the benefits weren't there
I own part of a roofing company
do you? in the dallas fort worth area
and unfortunately we were part of a bigger company
and we had all the benefits there and I do miss that
but on the other hand I enjoy having the time that I have with my family and being able to work when I want and
I think today the thing that I would appreciate the most because my husband gets his medical through his company
but we have to pay for mine
and I'm the only one that's being insured and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has is that right? so it's kind of
and I would I really and the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits you need to have it's it
I'll tell you what that is the single most benefit that I enjoyed and I do miss
because I looked into picking up some medical insurance just for my family just and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it it's out of sight
it's out of sight and
even at a group rate I couldn't believe how much is our
even at a group rate it's unbelievable and the amount that you have to pay for kids and if you want to add dental to it that eats even more it goes up
I guess the other benefits that I miss is some of the bonuses and stuff that goes on with just being involved with a big company
and course these days you can't count on that because
I feel bad for the people that are involved in that g m deal there in arlington
and I'm sure it will be quite a few people are affected by that
it's going to hurt the city although I will personally tell you I used to work at a bank and I would see the g m people come in when they would shut down to retool
they were paid that whole time and I don't know if you're aware of this
they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in every friday and go to the safety deposit box and I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week and they had all these is that right?
I really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked the union and right now anybody's that's laid off from g m will have a full year's paycheck I just read this in the paper the other day is that right?
plus probably an additional six months through the worker's stuff that they have through the company so I'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt
but I don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check really the
and that would be it really the ones it's going to hurt is actually the businesses around in that area
that's already hurting that's the ones that that's going to hurt because they depend on that but I think there's a case where benefits have gotten
they voted them in and they got so good like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things
and it made the prices of cars go up and the
I believe in unions but they went too far I'll tell you I've had my fill of unions
I can't make eighteen dollars an hour I
I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour what are your music interests?
just about any kind of music except acid rock
I don't care for acid rock me too
but I grew up with country and western I did too
but just about any kind of music and then
I even like classical music I'm pretty diversified too I don't like acid rock either I grew up in a small town so we only had one radio station so it was country music but then when I
I grew up with hank snow and lefty frizzell and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs you're older than I am
but I did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with james galway? we don't get channel two our cable doesn't
I wish we got that what but
that is fabulous was it? we don't get channel two we
when he played danny boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing
and it was tremendous he is a actually I did I played flute for almost ten years
so I appreciate his too his
he's from ireland isn't he?
and it was mostly all irish tunes was
they had a band with him that had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the tin whistle and a couple of violins and uh drum
and they played all the irish jigs and so forth it was just fabulous he is really good I come from a musical background
so I've played flute and piano so I have a big appreciation for music up to a point
I'm getting now to the age where I don't like much of the new stuff that's coming out
my husband says I'm getting old
I especially like instrumentals do you?
I love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen that's nice to do that is I've got a two year old who's now getting I'm getting well versed in kiddy music
I've never played an instrument in my life I've always wanted too
I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something
but but I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music I was one of the forced ones
I could never do that
and I was never that brave but
I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir I've done that at church too
I haven't done that in a long time
so let's see what what kind of music do you not like?
like I say the acid rock I just do not an I don't care for rap music either that's not music
that is not I don't know what that is but that's not music
if I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it it's not music it's just talking in a beat it's not exciting at all
it doesn't give you relaxation
you can't dance to it you can't do anything to it
but I and I like orchestra music too like the boston pops or anything
have you ever been to the dallas symphony?
have you? are they good?
they're good are they? I have never been
and we went and saw les miserables
the music in that was fantastic I've heard that that is a really
I heard that was hard to get tickets to
it I can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets
but it was out at the state fair music hall and it was well worth the price that was a real was it? I bet it was
I really bet it was is that the only musical do you go see a lot of musicals?
just ever so often a real good one like that one
and that would be nice
I went and saw sugar babies that was good that had good music in it was it? how I don't know what that's about
that was the one with mickey rooney and what's that not real old dancer
I can't think of her name I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it helen something I think I know who you're I know who you're talking about real long legs and dark hair she's got black hair
I know who you're talking about I can't think ever her name either
I can't think of it that was I remember that being here a few years ago
but the last country music my parents still really like country music
and they like the oak ridge boys and the statler brothers and my parents
the blackwoods my husband likes country music real well and he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah
and he really likes shenandoah alabama alabama
I think they're a bit over exposed
I get tired of every other song being alabama on the radio
either alabama or hank williams junior I've never cared for hank williams junior I never have either
and I never have figured out how he won entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row
we watch those award shows too we enjoy watching the country and the grammies and stuff but I just don't care for him
I just never have I don't
I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is probably eddy arnold is it?
I think I know who that is I think my parents have some of his records
but I had some I sold some of them I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight r p m records of country and western songs
smiley burnette I don't know if you were old enough to remember him I've heard the name
he played in the old western movies he was the sidekick of gene autry I believe
or they I think his name in the movie was froggy and I've never seen a gene autry movie
had a real raspy voice
and some of those old ones of course bob wills miss texas playboys ernest tubbs and red foley an I never have
those go back quite a way
I took them up here to collectors records and was able to get a little money for them
but my mother and dad use to own a restaurant it's hard to
and they had a nickelodeon of course in the restaurant
and when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records that that's neat so that's where I got my that would be great if they weren't too worn out at the time
of course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight r p m records is there not? you'd think there would be
the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that particular kind of needle that's true
and they just won't play on a modern day phonograph that's a shame
because we go to antique stores a lot and you see seventy eights a lot at record stores
you'd think there'd be a market for
I'm sure you could find old players for them but that would cost a fortune if you could find them that worked
of course they just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because you get that scratchy sound
those things were big and thick weren't they?
you could kill somebody with them
warped real easy and the ones you buy go out and buy one now and they're just so thin and flimsy
and they're not meant to last at all
neither are tapes we buy cassette tapes
and machines will eat them
and so the best bet these days are compact disk those things are practically indestructible
but I guess the old country and western music you back then when I was a kid there wasn't that much t v so that's all you had to listen to was the radio radio
and that's just what you had plus
I think it was better back then to there's too much t v now
and the radio is more exciting really than television your imagination
kept and it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does
I remember mother and dad always turned on the grand ole opera
was it on the radio every week?
what day was that on can you recall
seems like it was on a friday friday or they tell you what our topic was?
I think golf isn't it? how much of a golfer are you? are you a hacker? you bet
I'm fifty years old I've been a hacker I think I played better golf when I was fifteen john than I play right now I know I did I know I did and
course I know I watch my thirteen year old play now and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body I know it's just unreal I'm a guy that plays if I play a lot of golf I play six to eight times a year and that's about it I figure that's my retirement game I really I come from a family of golfers
I was raised by a man my stepfather who with a two handicap he could get down on his knees and hit the ball further than most people could hit it
my mother who is now seventy one I can remember her being a sixteen or a fourteen handicap
but all they did every day in their life was to play golf every they'd leave work and go to a golf course or a little country club they belonged to back in richmond virginia and just play nine holes of golf
that was their deal they
that's what it takes you need to play that often to get a really good handicap but I just never could do it
I have a brother in law who is an ex college coach and like a pro and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family
I went to I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more and I went after it and and I really didn't find much improvement fact ever time I'd start trying to correct something it seemed like the score would go back up I think I need to
I probably need to take some more lessons and practice more often spend more time on the I think I'm probably the same way lessons do help I know ever year we buy I go to this ducks unlimited dinner it's a hunter's type affair
and I buy in austin texas I go down to austin I live in the dallas area but I go down to austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine
and we always buy this weekend at a country club in the hill country at horseshoe bay
I'm familiar with it and we just have a ball and we play three days in a row three different courses and course by the end of the third day and the end of the third course my score has gone from a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five so
if you play regular I think it makes a big difference you bet so that makes a lot of difference to me
I've also found too I try to work out regularly and when I am doing that and feeling loose and that I swing better I get through the ball better and I also if I I found as I've gotten a little older here I worry less about my distance you bet
and I my control is a little bit better there
so that's super I haven't learned to hit the ball easy and I just sort of
I'm always wanting to hit it hard and that's something my stepfather never could teach me just to relax and hit the ball and subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve fourteen holes a lot of my energy's gone when I do swing it's an easier swing
and I do actually hit the ball better
have you ever tried a one iron? I have a two through wedge I hit a two iron awful lot off the tee I don't hit a driver off the tee
that's why I need my driving lessons
I put mine back in my bag this year too and I used a three wood rather than a driver that helps
I had a lot more control on it I sacrificed distance but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway that's a good idea I think this next year I'm going to attempt to play more and I'm going to do the same thing I laid off my woods about three years ago and I just use a two wood off the fairway and I'm a fairly strong person so I get a pretty good little drive
and and I guess control my irons better if you'll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron
and I still remember that watching myself and my son but I think the key is you need to play more often than I play
I read recently here they say if you're scoring well you should play more if you're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice range
I think there is less frustration factor there too makes good sense
but I the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I should pick one up and try to start apparently they're very difficult to play with but with practice I would imagine you could groove that swing too and I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron it's incredible
and his accuracy is what's so startling with it and I but it's an iron that he's really practiced with he has used a lot and it would be fun to get that good with uh distance iron you bet
my challenge of the game is just if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you I'd be great after that
that I just if I get off the tee box and I've anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight I just want to get down and kiss the ground
and get away without embarrassing yourself because
do you own a p c by the way? I'm guessing you probably do
I don't have one in my home here my parents have one and they live just about three miles away so we use that one I see
and my in laws also have one and they're almost as close
they're in richardson and what kinds of things do you use it for when you go to them?
usually word processing something such as forms for things
also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years
and we got the one that my parents have is an apple two e
and I have a sister in law who works in the fort worth school district
and so she got me copies of several of the apple programs for school programs
and so we use those and there's some whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game so that's part of it
my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things his resume his letter
he's been applying for jobs and things so that type of thing forms for his photography business and that kind of thing
I tell you once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly
I'm my father had a software company
and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing here
but they're kind of older
so I'm not sure that we'll be able to get too many other programs for it I'm a writer by profession and when I was first here in dallas or in plano I was finally able to afford a new typewriter and I got an I b m selectric I thought I had died and gone to heaven because I thought they're so wonderful
I have one of those then
mine's broke at the moment but ours really needs to have some work done on it but then my husband worked at t I he doesn't work there anymore but he got the t I professional and brought that home and I learned wordstar on that
and once that happened there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter
I learned wordstar I did some typing for my father when he had the company
and so I learned that on there too that was have you ever used wordperfect? or
I haven't that's the one that my father I guess I have used it once or twice
it's the one that's on my father in law's computer
he's got on I b m that's probably where you've used it
so that's the program that they're using there I have that on my computer here and also I do some work at u t d and that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and already know the software and I don't know from my own experience wordperfect is just so much better than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that I used to have it may be improved by now but
that's what I've heard wordstar was never very intuitive to me you some of the commands just had nothing to do with what they did on the computer but
going forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just didn't match with the kinds of keys you were using
you had to memorize it
and but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways and it does a lot of things too that if you do any kind of research or anything like that where you have to use footnotes it is just wonderful because it keeps track of all your footnotes
that's neat and if you put a footnote in the middle if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you
how wonderful so it's just
I had heard that that was a better one
and I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything and it was just awful so I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled but I think it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled
I agree so I have not really paid much attention because I clock
although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c s
not too much what kind of things do you write? I was a technical writer for many years
and my husband and I actually met in a computer company I was a tech writer and he was an engineer so I did tech writing for a number of years go talk to daddy about it excuse me
go on and talk to daddy about it tell daddy I unplugged it for you but you don't need to drag it down the hall got a problem?
daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged trying to figure out what all that was about?
but I have that was the majority of my writing although I have also done free lance magazine writing and some educational writing and for a while I had a partnership in an advertising agency with another woman who is an artist so I did some advertising and p r but
actually I'm not working anymore I'm a graduate student so I'm doing a lot of writing but now all of the scholastic majors though
I've done a lot of different kinds but I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great so I'm real spoiled
I'm anxious some day to have one here
I'm and they just talked the other day about setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing
my nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer so that's great
I've those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children
that's right so I think that that would be a real advantage to her to have that and do it early so
we've been writing a story together
and I wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it
and so I decided if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
so we'll slowly learn just to type here and then put the story in that's great
that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life so might as well start now?
I agree nola I have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly this is really going to be fun I think
and my husband is a ham radio operator and I think about all the people that he talks to all over the
what are some of your favorite foods? mine
I imagine in argentina you've got some great foods we got a lot of european dishes
we got what some people call the best beef in the world
so it's bishu every sunday you go out and you buy all these parts of the cow and then you just cook them over a grill that's in our house it's already built in there's this whole special place in the back so you can make a barbecue
I've had that meal in new york where they bring you a plank with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it's marvelous and then
I have to find a place around here that has that they have an argentinean place down in georgetown so
I'll keep that in mind
you serve that yourself or for a family? excuse me?
you ever serve that yourself when you have company? the problem is I'm only twenty two
but when I'm down at home
and somebody says when are we having this and I'll cook it
you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on and then you put all these different meats which take different times
do you buy them separately at an american grocery store or do you have to you don't go buy it from a wholesaler but what happens is in argentina they have all these little places like the fruit stand and the dairy products and whatever
little butcher shops and so
I've lived in mexico so I know and so they got the meat place
and so you just go there and you can't find chicken there you got to go to another place to find the chicken
you have poultry place what dishes do you serve with it? basically it's what we call it impenadas which is
the turnover the stuffed turnover meat turnovers
I love those and then we also put sausages on a bun and then that's to start out with
and then what you have is also three different kinds of salad and that's about it
do you remember when you were in washington sam the argentine baker?
it used to be in georgetown years ago he moved I guess he retired and went back to argentina I guess in the early seventies
so that's before your time
your parents might remember if they were here then we were only there for two years
he was wonderful we used to get the most marvelous impenadas and other argentine things
and what I also eat now since I graduate I have an italian roommate and
I'm italian are you?
and being argentinean we also have a lot of pasta and
because there're many italians in argentina and my mom makes what we call niokes and all this stuff lasagna and everything
my grandfather came to the united states through argentina
this was around the turn of the century actually a little bit later nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen
at one point one third of the population of argentina was italian pure italians
I'll tell you it's interesting because when we cook here I'm of italian descent my husband is chinese
and we both love continental cooking french cooking
so we cook our meals are we don't usually mix I mean that sometimes
if we're entertaining we'll do a chinese recipe
and there are really easy recipe that is with chinese you always have several dishes
and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave
I don't know if you have one
and if you like chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done
and it's a wonderful flavorful piece of fish is it?
because I was at it's like when you go buy fish
I buy the fish so you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish
and I've seen the filet
buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish counter what kind of fish?
any white fish sole is good flounder sole or flounder is real good and even grouper so we put soy sauce and sesame
little bit of soy sauce and sesame seed oil
and not too much soy sauce some chopped up slivers of scallions and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes
and if the fish flakes it's done don't overcook it though because I got one of those little microwaves the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water
just check it during
and another quick dish if you like do you know what hoi sin sauce is it's that sweet chinese sauce? I don't
if you go in a chinese store ask for hoi sin h o I s I n wait wait wait h h o I h o I s I n or s e n s I n
either way they'll spell it hoi sin sauce it's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown and if you take little pieces of pork little cubes of pork and you fry them with garlic and a couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in
and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice how much pork do you buy for two people
for two people if it's american style I buy a half a pound if you're just serving that but if you're serving another dish with it with guys pretty healthy appetites I'd probably go a third of a pound
and then you could I could probably go half a pound
and you can always heat it up again and save so it's just since I'm from argentina I just love meat and we
you can also do the same thing if you have ground beef
just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables
just stir that in and you've got another dish and how much does it cost? the hoi sin sauce?
a dollar twenty nine a can
a can would serve you for quite a few meals I thought it was maybe five fifty or something
it's not expensive at all it's one of the chinese cooking basics
listen it was good talking with you same here
hope you enjoy your recipe thank you
and your occupation is teaching?
I'm a substitute teacher substitute teacher
is this pat I'm talking to now? it is it is
I'm a substitute teacher in the same school system we both work in I was just trying to make an introduction here
and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school this year
I've just gotten another job at an elementary library at barron
I bet you may dress differently then for that I not really every day I've got to read to kindergartners so I'm going to be down on the floor with them I've got about forty kindergartners I'm going to be working with every day for a half hour so I'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because if I'm going to be down on the floor messing with them I'm not going to wear nice nylons and dresses
what I wear sometimes depends on how cold I think the school might be or what room I might be in since I'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater
of course you've been at clark enough that you know it's always cold
but you don't know at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there
you try to layer so you can add or take off subtract
and it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual I think some of the dress codes are different at different schools that's one of the things I ask about whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing
and I said that was okay and I'm basically I wear slacks year round except about once a week I try to wear a skirt and in the winter I maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer
that's about I don't really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and look really
and for me sometimes they even have dress up days or they have spirit week that you wear your different outfits
and you have to have the color for that particular school if you choose to participate in spirit week and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you?
but because I sort of stick to several schools I'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and might remember to do it
and then many schools on a particular day during football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for game day which on what thursday
it might be thursday for the high schools and it may be friday for the senior high schools so that would kind of give you a clue I guess and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time of what's going on
that so that's and I don't know I think about the dress code they have for the kids are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers I know wear dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease
and they'll wear it with a nice top and I don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they have to dress up I guess you can tell the teachers that too
it I see that the I think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than some of the high school teachers
but I think it varies just so much anything can go
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at clark they're all pretty fancy but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other departments that aren't
and they'll just wear your common ordinary whatever you might say there's a couple teachers up there that do dress up more than others
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them and you always course it's a standing joke when the men come in a tie and a suit coat you say have you got a job interview today or there's usually something going on that would cause that to happen or you're going to be observed
and I don't know how a coach would feel that teaches health or english or whatever that they had to wear a tie I some of those male coaches that might really
they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants and a t shirt
that I didn't ever understand we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so
at vines the coaches don't do that whether
they dress pretty good I would say and then they go to their coaching and they put their shorts on there change then
that's what I would think
that's what I would think
but they don't wear their sweat pants or anything they dress like any other teacher would in a classroom situation not in p e
course we had one coach one period he'd teach p e and the next period health and then a period of p e
those I can understand and that's hard
so he just left warm ups on but I think really probably they could really and I don't know if they make uniforms the thing for the kids I guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and I don't think we'll ever get to that you don't think so
I don't think I think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that many they've had uniforms for years I don't really know if they still do some of them they do and it's not at some of the private schools
it certainly makes it easier to dress but even there's a couple public schools in dallas where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers dress in accordance with that
it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe I think it would make a difference at school I don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too short or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high it's a lot of trouble to take care of that
and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what I want and yet we can't to that either I'd like to see them go to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt that would alleviate any t shirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a button down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted and
but I doubt that that will come about and then the girls just
I I don't not in plano not they may get
but they said in the dallas schools that that helps their educational process there
I think it does it takes their minds off of trying to compete highland park's thinking about going that route
so it and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do
I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but I agree with you on books
mainly I read the bible these days
that's very good I do too that's great to hear and christian literature
I've kind of I used to read a lot of novels but it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the bible and you work and whatever that pretty well takes up your time for reading
it does it and I been praying that god would put a desire to read the bible in my heart and he really has it's getting to where a just really want to read it that's good
that's good it's hard for me to find time also to read a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that because I don't have a lot of time but when I do get to sit down and read I like to read the bible and I like to read I read to my daughter a lot too do you?
and I like to read I have bible storybooks
so I like reading those to her and she really enjoys those so that's good and it's kind of short because we don't have a lot of time to read
so it's real enjoyable for both of us have you ever read any of frank e peretti's?
frank e I guess I haven't this present darkness and I forget the other he's also written a lot of children how old is your daughter
five five he's written some children's books as well and they're all spiritually oriented what's his name again? peretti frank e peretti frank e peretti p e r e t t I
I have to look for those do because I love to read his children's books just
just to read them that's good they're good they're great
that's good and it's usually about a family of archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like digging in old ruins and running across the old gods and things
that sounds pretty neat it is it's real exciting
I'll have to look for those and it also teaches them spiritual warfare so
that's neat I have a my daughter has precious moments collection
and I like that because it's real easy to follow for her if I read straight out of the bible to her she'd never understand any of it it's hard for me that's right
it is real hard to follow and understand
and I've got a bible that has a little bit of a glossary in the back and it helps explain who people are that's about the hardest thing is who's related to who I know it and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats
it sure is but it is good reading and it's good for us and everything that's right
I really do enjoy it but I also but then on the other extreme I like to read horror steven king type books I've read a lot of his too
the and I like that that's good fun reading can't put them down
you can't you really can't they are good and they're just so suspenseful
I really do enjoy his there's another guy what can what is his name you would when you're recording you can't
I know dean kratz or kranz or judith krantz? who?
judith krantz I know her it's a guy
and he writes the same thing though it's that real gruesome horror stories
that's good koontz his last name ends in a z I know that
I think I know who you're talking about I've seen I don't think I can pronounce it either but
I'm in a book club and I think I've seen his books in there I've never read any of his but they're real I kind of got burnt out on steven king though it seems like it's all the
did you ever read the it's one of his first books the stand
that long thing I know it and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that
they do kind of follow or are similar that
I love that book though I thought it was great
it really was and I loved the shining
that was my favorite those hedges when they started moving
whenever they made that into a movie I was thinking if they show that I'll just die for some reason that scared me more than anything
that is he just brings stuff alive
you could just visualize everything that's and that was a pretty scary movie too
I think they did a pretty good job but they didn't follow it exactly
but they did do it justice that's right
but most of the time they don't follow books very well when they make them into movies that's true I liked it as well
that's another big fat one I did too
that was good I also liked cujo did you read that one? and except it broke my heart I'm a dog lover me too
and then night stand is that night it was
dead zone that's one I liked what? dead zone that was a I've read that one too that was a real good one he's written a lot of books
he just sits down eight hours a day just like any other job I know it
and then he has some under another name that he's written that's right that one about the gypsies or that hunger or
I think his name was bachman he wrote under the name of bachman richard bachman
he is really interesting he's so prolific
I wish I could do that I know it and I have gone back and after I graduated I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit too
I do too I love good old once you can get into the language the
it's like it's english but it's not the same english they speak today
so it's kind of hard to keep at it but that's true but I they're worthwhile literature?
that was one of my favorite subjects in school was literature me too
I used to love those good old books I didn't mind doing that at all nathaniel hawthorne is pretty scary himself
I liked why can't I think of their names the one that wrote wuthering heights wasn't that jane ehre?
that was another one he wrote jane ehre too
you know who I'm talking about
those are good old books and classics that's right
sure is neat that's why I like to watch that masterpiece theatre on channel thirteen because they'll take a classic and televise it put it into a viewing format more or less
a lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays
I know it's really hard for me I work two jobs and have my daughter and teach sunday school and go to school myself do you?
so it's hard for me to sit down and read I can imagine
but when I do I just love it me too
I think we've accomplished five minutes so I think we have too thank you very much it's good talking to you you too
I spent four years as a university professor and
I spent three years I'm teaching in public schools and elementary school do you really? that's great
I taught in utah and did you teach in california? no kidding I did I did
you sound pretty young for a university professor I was pretty young I was I had never intended to do it and I was given the opportunity after I'd started a management consulting firm to teach in one of the business schools in the california state university system
at any rate the topic is fascinating because one of the things I've done for the past few years is research the problem from the point of view of what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically
you may be familiar with cooperative learning have you ever
you can tell me a little bit more about it because I don't think we did that in utah the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and what it involves basically is the use of peer groups and the teacher becomes a sort of a resource person to the learning cooperatives
and there are some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people gain a competence with respect to the material
I think that the combination of technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators
and both teachers and parents complain about the cost and ineffectiveness that results my feeling is that the problem is significant there are plenty of good people available to offer people educational experience but that we just have to reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly accelerate the pace of learning
and my feeling is that those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually I don't know what form it will ultimately take but I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that
I see what year saying I totally agree I don't think it's a matter of talented people to do it both as quote unquote students and as teachers but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent
you must see kids with real significant problems in some cases course I always see the I don't know how hard is it in the public school system in iowa city? is it deteriorated a lot do the people say are they pretty happy with it or
I haven't taught in iowa but I've taught in utah and people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to where they taught their kids at home or anything but the public schools and the ones that did have the kids even in utah
maybe it was the area I was in utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe
but a lot of schools had a lot of transient families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side and so you saw a fair number of troubled kids
you said how the schools are doing more things for the kids than they were thirty years ago the school I was teaching at the year I left they were considering providing hot breakfast for the kids as well as hot lunch and is it stacy? angie angie I'm sorry
if you were going to have a dinner party what would you make?
let's see I like seafood let's see shrimp steamed shellfish with maybe herbs spicy lobster with linguini that sounds good
what is the steamed shellfish you said?
and what would that be like a clam or
I think hors d'oeuvres are good too and that way you can have a variety so if you have a a dinner party and you're going to serve seafood for supper what type of hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?
cheeses or fruits or vegetables or
fresh vegetables would be good or just probably not nachos and dip?
and would it be appropriate to drink when you have the hors d'oeuvres?
and then when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with seafood?
all these hard questions
what white wine? that would be my guess and then dessert
I'm not really a drinker so I don't know a lot about that something sweet?
chocolate something chocolate you must like chocolate
let's see usually when we have a dinner party I like to grill
you do? so we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip some cheese one of our favorites is to take some philadelphia cream cheese and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and wash them and cool them and then dump them in the sauce and then take crackers
and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail and then I like to barbecue steaks or pork chops and then lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad
and then I don't know what we usually have for dessert cake sometimes but that's what we would do for a dinner party I guess
that sounds good too but I guess when you talk about dinner party that's more for when friends come over traditional traditional
I wouldn't be the big snotty kind
I just really started learning about that
and I bought a martha stewart I don't know if you've heard of her
her cookbook and she talks about catering and goes into all that and the different types of parties different types of foods do you work in a setting where you are in the food business?
my father owns a restaurant is it in dallas?
it's just a cafe so it's not really anything that I want to it's not the same
it's in lewisville you graduated from which high school?
trinity trinity and that's a public school or private?
that's public I have to get to know this area a little better I guess is your father's cafe one that you could cater out of?
it's not and he's not interested in letting his twenty one year old daughter experiment with it probably
let's see what else for catering
let's see what about hawaiian luau that would be good
could have fruits and pineapple let's see and you could actually go with a chicken if you wanted to
I think decorating your food is really
so you enjoy camping?
like you I haven't done any in quite some time except for what I call living now which is very close to camping
is it? I camped in the boy scouts and my dad and I went out sometimes but even my first eight or nine years of working I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction
and it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress
when you have to have it you have got to have it
and in those kinds of situations room rent which is outrageous
so my buddy and I we just camped
and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it
of course we didn't really rough it that much when I was in high school he is a couple years older than me and he graduated and went off to college and during the summer we would camp out at the lake
but it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove
I had a little boat house and floated it out on lake grapevine
and it was fantastic we would get up in the morning go skiing that substituted for a shower
and then we would go to work and come back to the boat house at night and in the afternoon it is still four o'clock you have got four hours of day light good skiing left and it was great
but now all my life is more like camping than not camping really
do you have electricity out there
you've got a phone obviously actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago
we didn't have a phone
they didn't have phone lines you just couldn't get phones
and we are third from the end on the electric string
so we are at the end of the mail route
like I said we are probably as far as you can get from the seven eleven and still be in texas
I guess so but right now what we did my wife and I is we got a mobile home one of these twelve by forty eight's that got repoed and swapped them a cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day
I'm in construction and I just had this place to shower up while I was out here putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in
and I came home from work one friday afternoon and our truck was back everything we had was in boxes and my wife said we're moving
and I said where and she said out to the trailer and I said oh she said yep and I said okay
so we have been roughing it out here for about three years but it is not bad we have color t v microwave
it is not horrible but it's a lot like camping
I grew up in california in central california right in the valley
so it is a forty five minute drive to the mountains so my dad loved fishing and camping so we would go up first we went up with a toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and cooked our hot dogs by the fire or whatever
but then later my mom and dad got a camper so we have kind of moved up became civilized
a little bit in the world my mom goes camping she takes her motor home she's got one of these huge winnebago's with a refrigerator and air conditioning color t v microwave oven
she just roughing it for me is going to the holiday inn and getting a shower
but she has a lot of fun
and mostly it is just a way to she goes to dog shows
she shows dogs and you can sneak a dog into a motel
but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel
so she takes the motor home and she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing
and she if he would buy her a motor home so he did
but as far as camping my wife and I have plans to not really camp per se but to drive up the highway one there in california as soon as we get this house finished
that will be pretty I am going to need a vacation that's really pretty out there there are a lot of nice places
let's see we keep our paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and plastics and we make the dump over to the wal mart bins there as soon as they're full I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable
are you in the part of town where they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling? I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet
maybe they don't I know that was supposed to be in may and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were I haven't seen any so I thought that it had all been delayed several times so I have no idea what they look like and I'm kind of anxious to see them
that's going to be interesting because we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is
I look at our big green containers and I say they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where
it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people I don't know what you saw back years ago but for me the thing that strikes me growing up in rural south dakota where the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that in the fifties you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now which was all the milk bottles were glass
and you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them
of course that they did actually we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed
and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put another gallon of glass bottle in there
I look back at my childhood and I'd say they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so I hope that this time it stays just to see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing
actually when we go dump our things we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics
so that's kind of encouraging I didn't know if we started to do that I didn't know what to expect
I'll have to say the only one I'm good at at this point is the newspaper taking that to the boy scouts and my aluminum cans getting rid of those
but on the plastic I don't have any habits there yet and guess I'm waiting for the city to push me in that direction but it just seems like on the larger scale that we always talk about in our society that economic strife things I guess they will shortly I
and I think if we just start to put the nickel deposit on things like was the case years ago that it would have more immediate effect than because I remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money
and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so outside my little town we would go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something
do you know in tom thumb yesterday I saw the return to the small coke bottles
and I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not
I that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying? they were the glass let's see they'd be maybe six ounce or ten ounce sort of a small size and we didn't stop and look at them a long time
and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down sort of a basket type thing the paper carton
I hadn't seen that in a long time
I mean the you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold twenty four bottles and I'm not really going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now
it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because on the grass I know your husband doesn't really like the paper sacks he doesn't like the paper sacks but he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't
I'm the same way because otherwise I generally listen to neal sperry on saturdays and neal's a person who says I like to pick it up but I don't believe in throwing it into the landfill so I have my compost pile but most of us don't have the sufficient lot size to do that
so I'm glad the city's willing to take that on that's nice I guess they dump it the same place I wonder where they dump that
there's someplace if it's because really when I look at what my grass does in actually about twenty four hours knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally composts or stores and so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's certainly usable material they must keep it separate if they have this date in
they have this day now that it's separate from the other trash pick up
but the thing I don't understand about that is when it's one thing to send grass there but I've trimmed trees and other things which end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly you've done
our most recent series of projects inside was we remodeled a bathroom recently how did it go?
it went pretty well other than the fact that we encountered some problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing which one thing led to another and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over like starting over I guess
it wasn't one of those it started out as a sunday project
and by the next sunday it was done it wasn't a one dayer believe me that sounds like course I don't know once you get it done then you probably won't have that problem again
it's good for another thirty years you've got an older house?
they are built a little bit more sturdy than
that's the thing that surprised me because once I got into the plumbing everything in there was copper
and it was all soldered is that right
that's what drove me bananas because I'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and cement to fit them together and nothing wanted to go so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over and just start at square one
that was an all day job just to get it plumbed and then if you do it wrong
fortunately I was very fortunate in the fact that when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked everything went all right everything worked and I just said that's marvelous I appreciate it that's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens
I expected something to leak left a fitting loose or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that
but it all came together so I felt pretty fortunate about that all worked out all right
how about you? probably the last thing I did was paint and wallpaper kids room
and I learned to I used the wrong kind of paint this must have not been a very good quality because it just hasn't stood up very well
what kind of paint? it was a latex paint it was flat
and I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that
that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls but I think maybe I don't know if it was just the
was it not washable paint? it is a latex paint but it just kind of is so it's supposed to wash you're supposed to be able to wash it
but it just looks dingy I don't know how else to explain it what color is it? it's pink
pink it's kind of got just kind of a worn look to it I don't know even how to say just didn't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked but
did you require more than one can of paint? we put two coats on it and it's a small room but I think it only took one can
you didn't have to mix paint then
we did you do mix the color as far as you start with white and then they add the color
you know what I'm saying but
but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with
and then I wall papered a couple of walls and
how'd that go? that was the first time I've ever wallpapered and kind of fun isn't it that's an education in itself
but the dye lots must have been a little bit different from first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you're trying to match a design
repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you buy your paper that's what I needed and I didn't think about that I got a mickey mouse print is what I got
and so a lot is wasted
normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats so you know how I didn't even think to look for that
and then the one of them was just a different color pink is what it ended up being and
when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall? I didn't or did you start at the edge? is that how you're supposed to do? I started at one edge and went over then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window but
I've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall and I'll start with a plumb line and start in the middle of the wall and go from there and go all the way around the room and start right there do you seem to get it straighter is that the advantage or what's the you
do you do any recycling?
we do here what do we recycle? they recycle they have bins
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles and I think that's all they have
what about you guys? we there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is aluminum cans
but we've got a couple of different places they're like unattended aluminum can smashers and you can go up there and redeem we've got one that gives you a penny a can so if you
for smashed cans? actually you have to put them in there unsmashed
and when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
can you hold on for just a minute?
I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because just succeed
I guess I heard it that time
you guys only get a penny a can when you buy canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit? you probably get charged a nickel or something like that
and so it's like they charge you for the deposit so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just reimbursed
type of thing they don't charge us that extra nickel
that's sort of nice though it really is really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the price if you want to think of it that way
so when we get a twelve pack then that's twelve cents back
so you guys can actually get ahead
but they have sort of things that you're not reimbursed for or paid for we can recycle clear glass brown glass green glass and milk jugs and newspapers
everyone does newspapers everybody does newspapers
but that kind of stuff
but they said they can't be smashed or else it doesn't fit in their little containers and they're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed pepsi cans and whatever up there
send it to this address
but let's see they said that ways can encourage recycling I tell you what really works at least down here is if there is even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it then people tend to do it
that's in other words taking care of the environment is all well and good
but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as likely to do it as if you get something back for it as likely to do it
that's true so if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer it kind of reminds me of using an a t m card to get money or doing your banking
if it's free people will use it if it costs them something then they're not as likely to use it
but I know we had a problem down here with people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the drain sewer
and all that because there was apparently a lot of people every time they change the oil they just dump all their old oil down there
now they're starting to recycle that stuff
that's good another thing I thought of to recycle would be clothes because everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other and one way that we do it sort of in iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops
and that way you don't get near as much as you bought it for but you got the use out of it and what you're going to basically donate to a goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
and so that's something that I've never
we're new to iowa so that's something that I hadn't looked into before but that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle I guess I know a lot of places they
I guess this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like to do hand work mostly I do needlepoint I guess but
what kinds of things have you done? I've made a lot of baby gifts
it seem like that's especially lately there's been so many babies that bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings
do you ever keep any of your stuff? isn't that funny
I do crochet and a lot of things like that and I have very little of my own stuff and it's kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work
can you do it? isn't that funny I guess I do have one thing a friend of mine gave me a clock kit
and I needlepointed the face and I kept that because she gave me that so
that would be definitely something you'd want to keep and it's real neat
was the whole face done or just the numbers and minute marks? basically the whole I guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts
and then the at the numbers they're kind of outlined and stuff it was quite bit of work but it was a lot of fun too I really like doing stuff like that so
I did some needlepoint years ago and then I got into the bargello what's that?
it's an italian needlework using the I started to say the canvas but the what kind of cloth uses that I've just gone blank but it's used with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors it could be a flame stitch where rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel embroidery work that was done on them that's interesting what kind of things did you do?
what I did when I was doing that was mostly pillows for sofas and so forth and I can't find one that I've done
it's one of those things I didn't give them away but I didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or what and it I was so proud of them when I got them finished but I have no idea where they are what did you call that?
bargello it's b a r g e double l o that's I've never heard of that before I've probably seen it though
I suspect you have when you described it
when you described it it sounded like something that would be around I guess but I've never heard of it before and it's really interesting I guess I've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but I've kind of gotten out of that I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows me too
that's interesting it is
how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny what how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the how were you decorating the baskets? basically bows and lace ribbons
I really wanted to do so many of them now have the ribbons where I'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons they make them they I don't know how to explain it they make them hard?
like fabric that's been stiffened
I've never done that and those are so neat I would really like to do those but
I've seen some and they I suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady I've seen I know that does it I've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of six
and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
when I do crochet it's usually the lacy victorian type things like that
and I stiffen those with a glue mixture it's like white glue and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then allowed to dry in those draping streamers I don't know
I was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with high humidity in a room
I think that's what my concern was was it really sure and how they would last do you know what my concern is? how will I dust this thing? you're right
that's terrible that's true that's funny
so many of my crafts right now I'm looking at a little quilted hanging it's a flag and I don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors
and I hate to dust I know so first thing I think of is how easy would this thing be to clean
that's funny I do some I have really gotten out of it I don't do it quite as much as I used to because I went back to school so I don't have as much time
you don't have time and I have two children also
you definitely don't have time it keeps me very busy but I really enjoy it when I do do it when I get the chance it's really it's so relaxing to just sit but once I get started I can't put it down I just
I have a similar problem I've got to have time or I don't even want to get into it in the first place
and so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all I know I started a project that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for christmas
you just didn't say which christmas that's what I keep telling this person I didn't tell you what year
what was this project? it's cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work and I have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as I'd like to it's just so hard
this is done in the needlepoint? I it's counted cross stitch actually is what I'm doing and so since it's counted it's really a lot of work I do know
I have done a little bit of that but I decided that that's something that demands my total attention
and so I've got to have almost total silence I can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece
it does not sound like an easy one to finish it really isn't and I tell you I could just kick myself for even starting it because I have a feeling I'm never going to get it done I'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life
I'm sure you'll get it done but it just may not of the original obviously not of the original time schedule that's true I just don't know when I'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it it's just really hard but I really do like I said I really enjoy it when I do it's just hard
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated
and there's so many other things that I have done in the meantime like I said so many baby gifts I've made a lot of bibs and wall hangings and so those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them
do you use a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a kit for a bib or something like that I usually just buy a pattern book I have several pattern books and I just go with those
and then I buy the bibs separate usually I think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run and then I just use whatever colors I want to I don't usually use the colors they tell me to
and it depends on what it is but some things especially letters if they suggest certain colors for letters I just go with whatever I want to
that's what I would do too
or whatever I have there's a few designs I guess I've done myself but not very many real simple ones I do I made a little thumb print and made it a bunny
it was really easy just did a thumb print what with ink?
and then I didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print that was just the ink and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple
that sounds really neat it didn't take anything at all
did you use a stamp pad and ink and then I just
so you just like being finger printed
I haven't had too much of a chance to watch t v lately
so probably everything I going to say is kind of dated
I can understand that it's that time of the year
my wife and I just recently moved into our house so we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but like to keep up to date too
I guess in the since I got out of college which was about five years ago my t v viewing started to tend more towards documentary news programs things like that
something that's going to keep mu up to date I've kind of gotten away from being a series watcher having to keep up to date with I think when you're in college you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week
that makes a big difference so I used to when my kids were real little and I was home I watched where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis but right now the last things I watched regularly was thirty something when it first came out
did you all ever watch that?
I started too and kind of worked away from that
I have a hard time sticking with something on t v because it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two
you feel kind of left out
but I know but I tell you what we're really strict with our kids about television and one night couple weeks ago it was just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said we'll sit down and we'll look at what you want to see let's just turn it on and see what's on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
I believe that so it was prime time it was seven thirty eight o'clock on a week night
and we have cable and there wasn't anything on any channel and the stuff that was on the networks a b c n b c c b s was it was just dribble
it wasn't even funny
that's right it wasn't creative it was the worst I've seen I have not watched prime time week night t v in a real long time because I was shocked I know exactly how you feel you know what I'm saying
that's right I when I first moved down here moved into the apartment and got cable and I guess I kind of became numb
nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the t v
and then all of a sudden I started paying attention to network t v again once in a while
right now we don't have cable
and it's surprising how much it's changed
the whole moral situation everything is just gone one whole complete direction different and we don't have any kids yet but I feel the same way it's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even cartoons
you watch some of the cartoons and kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there
it's none of it's probably damaging lot of times it's just a necessary evil when our children were younger when they were four years old three years old five years old we just had sesame street and that was about it
but now in order to seem humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff
but it's just one of those things you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're in the room but it's such a shame because it could be so good
that's right I don't understand why the public puts up with it why the networks think that we enjoy that kind of stuff
that's true it's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that can't be the problem
it must be the marketing pressures and their demographic studies that they do that show that everybody's I q has dropped dramatically or something
I'm glad you said it and I didn't have to but that's the I feel the exact same way
I sit and watch some shows and I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show I know
why do you do this to yourself? why do you do this?
I know I'm trying to think if there's anything I do I like stuff that's on great performances and we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that
stuff that mostly on public t v
as a matter of fact when I was a kid my parents used to have we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular t v that we watched we had to watch an hour of public t v
there's an idea that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they'd say what did you see on what's new or there was some other the children's program at the time was called what's new
so we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program
that's pretty good do you watch sports on t v? are you a sports fan?
I can't handle it very long
I'm a sports fan but it's kind of like reading magazines any more if half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad
but it's you're missing an awful lot
I'd personally rather see a game on t v than fight the crowds at the stadium but I don't sit down that's true the traffic
I'll sit down for the big games the super bowl and the championship things like that
but I don't follow any team
I check the scores the next morning and I know how everybody's doing and that suffices me but I like good humor once in a while
I enjoy that but do you get that
you don't have cable now I was going to say they have a comedy channel now but again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly commercials and then you're trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up you know what I did there was a time there where I could tape things and then I'd fast forward through the commercials
saved a lot of time that way
it works you bet but that takes too much planning
I don't know if there's any series that I pay attention to I try to watch cheers once in a while that is that still real good it used to be real good but it is is it
in fact I think it's on tonight
I just got in from outside so I
so I'm kind of out of it things like that and I consider that fairly intelligent humor
you can tell they pick up the words every once in a while isn't it such a long running program
they do have good writers for that that makes me think do you watch saturday night live at all?
I try to we try to stay up too
it's getting harder and harder ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up
it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it I think it's come around again it's gone through cycles it was we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there but we started watching again
but it's real different show than it was when it started
it's funny now and it's better but it's real different than what it used to be that's right
that's right but you can't be outrageous
if you keep that same format there's only so long that you can be outrageous so
that's for sure that is for sure I guess there are a few things around still but but you have to hunt hard for them
sounds like you pretty much agree I guess so
been good talking to you good talking to you take care you too
