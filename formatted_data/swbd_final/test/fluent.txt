have you had that experience recently? recently I can't really say recently but I think about a year ago I bought a product from some company down in atlanta georgia I believe it was one of these mixers these juice machines and the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked perfectly okay
but I found that it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting after
even despite diligent washing it got rusty after about three weeks of use and I don't think it was my fault because I had made a point of drying it off and cleaning it but it was I had to send it back after the third week because I realized it was not something was very very wrong with the blade what about you? I don't have so much trouble with products as service
I don't feel like that's as big a problem I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly
and I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent
the one I have now is okay most of the time
but that's it but that's probably the worst my daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed james avery I don't know if you have that up there but it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things
and she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now
and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said this was just obviously yanked
this was yanked they were so rude about it
and so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said it's not guaranteed and I said put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway
so we got the kind we wanted and I was really disappointed with that I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and I called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and I said my goodness I said you've been very nice what's your name and she told me and I said I really appreciate it I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager so
at least you're talking to somebody who counts so I felt kind of good about that I didn't even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything
but I just felt like at least I did something maybe they'll fix it they might work on that
but I find attitudes are more of a problem service is more of a problem
I find up here in the northeast we have these mail order companies like l l bean and they are famous for having really top notch service they've got
I have friends and family who order from them because you can literally I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half and even after eighteen months of reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore they'll actually do things like this they bend over backwards service wise for you I've found also a lot of companies nowadays they have eight hundred numbers you can call that's really great
I guess you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies and actually I've tried that with a few companies lately and most of them have been pretty good but I was one reason why I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that if you buy through bean or though I guess one of bean's big competitors is land's end out in wisconsin somewhere they're very good about
the customer is always right and no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding and they make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise that's really good it use to be like that but I don't think most places are like that anymore
nowadays with the economy the way it is I guess there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are things are getting rough out there there's a lot of the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn
I should say something
that I'm the least informed this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic but I'm the least informed person in the whole united states
this has not been determined yet but I've never read a newspaper in my entire life and I never watch t v news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off but
any particular reason? I've explored that with lots of people they've tried to lock me up and things like that but I'm basically not interested and I also find everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and off the what am I trying to say I do learn about things largely from friends
and I occasionally will read something like the new york review of books someone will write a book about something and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier
but it and somehow and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it but I don't think it's just that I'm lazy
I really don't I like to refer to this as sort of consumer report phenomenon which is everybody that I know reads consumer reports so the people who do feel that consumer reports does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest but assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas without thinking that there were people who think each other area of specialty
and I guess you could explain it two ways and the cynical view is these things aren't doing a very good job at all and the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or particularly interested in buying something as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things
and I think the same thing is true with news if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and especially the better papers the times the wall street journal the washington post give you a reasonable idea
if you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much doesn't want
let me ask by the way just for the record I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them I'm not being elitist in that sense I hope
there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things what
and most people think it is and I can accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it by the way when you say most people think it is I think it's like ninety nine point ninety nine think it is percent
I don't think it's that high you don't?
I know a lot of people who may watch the t v news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper
and I think they're saying if something's really important I'll at least find out that it happened
and that's is a reasonable start and for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked and if something important happened it was covered on t v and I could then go and pick up newspapers if it were important enough to read about
and I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels I did on the supreme court hearings for the whole business of I actually have a
clarence thomas or the thomas and anita hill business
that's the closest thing I deeply cared about that
and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine and when I arrived at her house she was engrossed in that we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more and I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on but even then I didn't end up doing it on my own
I stayed as far away from those as I could
I decided I didn't want to waste the time I had five years ago now wasted that kind of time with oliver north hearings and afterwards decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in and that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out do you ever read
a lot of companies now are using drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users
and I know the government gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government
and I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian
and I feel that if you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background of course we're being involved in my organization we have deep background checks but sometimes drug use can escape that
and I have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to figure out who has a drug problem and putting that guy into therapy whatever it is to break this activity
of course if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope
what's your feeling?
I guess I'm probably a little more toward the other direction
I guess mainly because I there's two sides to it I guess one is that if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever even if it's smoking inhibits your ability to function then I think that I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual on the spot but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition we've had laws against various other forms of drugs for the last sixty or seventy years
maybe a little longer I think the first morphine laws were nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that eighty years or so
so I it's hard for me to justify what seems like basically a breach of the freedom from search and seizure on something that may or may not stand as a law fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows the thing of it is that is in many respects just an over simplification
prohibition certainly didn't last I think there's so much criminal activity that people go into to support drug habits
but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there? they support drug habits with things like burglary or prostitution or stuff like that
it goes back to that again if you look at prohibition because it's illegal it costs more if it was legal face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for ten or twenty dollars an ounce I must admit that
and clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
but get I must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society
that's why there's people dealing it because there's money in it there's ridiculous amounts of money but I think that being in law enforcement I probably have a kind of a draconian philistine attitude toward it
but I really feel as though the interdiction effort is as soon as you get rid of one goon that's involved in drugs and
interdiction's hopeless and then another one will jump up
there's no way you're ever going to win that but we see
the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is that's a losing fight as soon as we wind up for if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand but people want to get stoned
and I don't see that
it goes back to what can society impose on people can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen?
I don't think you can I was raised with being a very strong bible work ethic so I'm one of these ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
so I can really relate to everybody ought to do their own share I don't have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff but
how do you feel about the crime in your city? is it
minneapolis isn't too bad I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders
that's kind of gone up in scale and some other things I personally had a little experience the other day somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck
but actually when you look at minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it's really quite a bit better because I came from florida
and in orlando crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever so what part of california are you from? san jose california
I have a good friend there here the real problems are the gangs
a lot of murders just in general the whole we've only been here a couple of years before that we lived in colorado but in comparison to colorado it's real noticeable
I can just sense I won't go to the grocery store at night
that's you know and it's that kind of thing and
that's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like we have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce home theft burglary and things of that sort
do you have that where you live or
interestingly enough right before I moved up here I'm an intern and then I go back down in may
but in orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in two and a half weeks
and one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there
because they were just it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work
and then the houses were left unguarded but I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that's a good way to work it with a neighborhood watch
also I've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home like on the weekends
is that right? a high percentage of free time I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is spent doing yard work outdoors
so they wait while you're outdoors they know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in slip in slip out that's amazing they know exactly what they're going for
so I've heard that's really on the rise as far as a new type of crime
it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter unfortunately
unfortunately it's starting to really look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day
one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at minneapolis because he's from detroit
and the crime level there of course is quite a bit more pronounced but I guess
I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in minneapolis I'm not real sure it helps to know your neighbors they give you you're supposed to make lists of cars I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if I see a car that's unfamiliar we have a list is that what you did in your program? where you have a list of license plates? pretty much
I was basically involved in that in the organization of it
and then I left right in the middle of it I'm not sure where we went from there but
that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious activities like that
you hate to be paranoid but there are really only so many things you can do you can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program as a woman not go out at night
you can do that which is what I choose to do
one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps
it's against the law to do a lot of things they could basically when I was getting robbed down in florida I was really considering electrifying doors things like that like that's
they did in miami that time but it's not if you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home it's considered self defense though that's not always true it isn't?
there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed
and essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home
the guy came in while he was home and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned he didn't die but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement
so that makes you think
it's like your hands are very much tied I think if you had a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's
do you know anyone that is in a nursing home or has ever been in one?
but my grandparents were looking into it before so I know what they've said
I'm trying to think my wife's grandmother had alzheimer's and they were going to put her into a nursing home and when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a nuisance or worse than a nuisance she sort of went bananas
they thought it was too much of a bother and they couldn't deal with her so I guess you need to know whether it's a no deposit no return kind of thing whether
if they're equipped to handle the kind of patients you're going to have put in there too
because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
they wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well have their own room
my grandmother actually was in a nursing home that there was a retirement hotel and then a there was some sort of full time care place that was also associated with it so for the first few years she had her own apartment and made her own meals sometimes but could also go and eat someplace else
and then as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to provide full time care and she didn't have to do anything anymore but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's I don't know whether that's because they sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is but I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only six months or something
a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help
they need health care so they're already ill before they go
that's probably a large factor if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are then you only go there as a last resort
or people send you there as a last resort
that's what my grandparents it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them
so that was their thinking somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency
and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time
I guess that's a problem too for people wait lists and all I guess
that you can't always get in when you want too and of course you can't just sit around and wait when you need it you need it I guess
and the money is also another issue how you're going to pay for it
at that stage of life you only have so much money left and I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
it is kind of fair but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise
so it's another problem and if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
so it's just so complicated anymore I think people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing
it's just a shame that's the way it has to be I think the retirement home idea's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay
and cause if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you to have friends
I've known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities I don't know if they have them back there but here in california and in
have you heard about saturns?
I've heard some about saturns I don't know a lot about them I haven't been over to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their reliability is rated to be equal to that of the japanese cars that's great actually that's kind of the type of car that I'm thinking about we might get saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a saturn dealer this offshoot of g m
and supposedly they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard
I've heard a lot of people like them yet I don't know whether I would buy saturn or not at this point I'm kind of my card and desires tend to be pretty picky and so like what?
let's see I like cars that are designed with human beings in mind
and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person who's working on it cause I do almost all my own maintenance and those types of things
and I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in finding a car anymore that's fairly easy for me to work on it's not very almost unlikely at this point
and I've got a sixty five mustang and I do most of the work on that myself
and when I look at modern cars and stuff like that I just say I will never do that with the modern cars it's not worth my time you can't get in there you can't do anything
and it's so complicated too I look at it and I say boy I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that
I've got an eighty three saab
and I find that for everyday things it's really very easy to work on and I'm kind of spoiled I used to have a chevy
with a three fifty in it
and I really liked working on it cause it was pretty easy too it was about a nineteen seventy so I'm kind of biased in that and I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore
and that's probably one thing I'd look at I think another thing I'd look at is safety that's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about actually one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags
that's a real nice car I think
I've driven some tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips as rental cars
and I've always been very impressed with the taurus it's a really nice car I think it's a stylish car both inside and out it's comfortable to drive reasonable performance and this is out in california where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore
I've been real impressed with that and I didn't realize that they were putting dual air bags in that car now ninety or the ninety twos the ninety twos had dual air bags
this newest model you could get them with duals
I think that that's excellent
that's excellent because but the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars actually my wife and I are actually contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so so we're actually been looking around and thinking about things
we'd like to get a I don't know what do you call it? a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that
year old ninety two or something like that those are if we
that would be a good deal to go with and the other thing we're looking at is the saturns too
because they looked really nice
what do you looking for in those? what attracts you to the saturns? or of course we've already talked the taurus is safe but what kind of things are you looking for? the saturns you can get air bags in them I don't think you can get dual side air bags
but one of the two things that I'm really I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart that doesn't have problems
you set down you look at consumer reports we've been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the u s auto makers when you do that
because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the taurus is one of the highest u s cars
and the other one are the saturns
so those two things and then we kind of want a four door
recently graduated from high school meaning three or four years ago I'm a senior in college now
and I can't really talk too much about the problems with public education in detail because the school system I went to was really superb even though it was a public school system
I feel that my I'm a junior in college now and I go to tech georgia tech?
and I I got a friend who goes there by the way I want to talk to you about that afterward
I've the high school I went to was a good one also and I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools because the one I went to was a lot nicer than a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta
it's more or less a suburban school system?
that was true for mine too although I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity
but I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it I know that in my town most of the parents they're valued education
what and so the students were to some extent motivated to learn that's true and I'm also
in those places where the economy is really bad they might be more tempted to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would in areas where they that's true but I think even more than that even if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read which it sounds like
that's true I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because they have these sort of mandatory tests you have to take before you get a diploma
but certainly before that there were people that would graduate from high school and could barely read
and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really I just can't even picture how that could happen except maybe to someone who's really badly learning disabled or something
but these people obviously weren't
that's hard for me to say since I didn't really grow
when I went to elementary school it wasn't in a great area but I started learning to read when I was in kindergarten
so I guess I can't say what it would be like to grow up in a really oppressed region
I guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people and I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably I think people just
so I guess the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn and and again I don't they got to know how qualified I think it'd be interesting to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school sort of maybe from elementary through high school just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
I think that'd be an interesting experience but I haven't done that
I can't say that I have either
but but I do think that public education in general can work and I think it's a good thing
I've heard statistics and things that compare a public education to a private education within the same income groups
if you compare the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that did send their kids to private schools
I think they compare fairly well I honestly don't really think I could have done much better than I did in the school system I was in
my schools there I have a lot of once I got into high school they had a lot of accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that
that makes a big difference cause I wondered when they're taking classes with people that are interested in the subject and stuff like that and in the
once you start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels I guess in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels of instruction in the major subjects which
actually I think that works pretty well and that makes I'm nevin from sunnyvale california
this is jim bliss from minneapolis minnesota how you doing? pretty good
I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it
I'm ready whenever you are
what are your thoughts on the subject there? I definitely think decisions have to be unanimous
I think that's probably a good thing it's probably the safest thing
it's to easy to get a quorum
and simple majority won't do and even two thirds majority it's
that's quorums are to easy to get
and there's always that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason so it's
definitely but I don't know I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing gives them a little too much power
I know of a couple of people who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently but plus you may be doing a guilty verdict but it may be for technical reasons
about the only good thing I would say about that is that it would hurry the process up a bit
but even now I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that and that's what the trial by jury I know
if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances who's to say it there would be much more of that
no doubt are you involved in the legal system at all? but I tend to follow it just to know what's going on
I've got some friends that are lawyers so I do too so
one of them just got his law degree but to tell you the truth I'm not real familiar with the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now
I really haven't studied it in depth I know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases which is
it's more in how you present it versus who's right
I'm sure of it because a lot of those things it's largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better
it's kind of weird I don't know I always think about watching the people's court or something and how weird those cases get I know it's just when I was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and
you say we can't bring up this point because then they're going to the opposition will say this this and this and
and it's the stuff that they can twist around is
it's pretty amazing and it's like the truth isn't really important anymore it's
it's not and then you get people who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because
this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people
and so he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case
it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers money and everything else that sounds like a little abuse of our system but
but but it's for the more general people don't want to take responsibility it's
and most of the time they're looking to place blame and stuff
you're from california is that right? originally from chicago but
I was just thinking I wonder how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and where I am in minneapolis I really from what I understand it's all pretty the same except when you get to louisiana
and louisiana is completely different cause it's based on common law and the rest of the country is not or something like that
pretty strange but fortunately I never have had to go in even for jury duty I haven't either other than
but that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in as a witness he may subpoena me
so we'll see what happens but I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better
it's there are too many big problems there's such a backlog of court cases right now to try to get them all in in a good time I know
and we already have too many lawyers as it is and if it's criminal cases you can't put them in jail because there's no room left
that's true and in fact they're even letting some go
I'm originally from florida and it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them
that's not a good solution either not at all I'm not real sure what the
the last auto repair I had was I have a nineteen eighty four nissan truck I had a tune up done and I had the brakes done on it and then the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope and it has eight spark plugs and it's hard to get at them and plus the time on them I just don't have time any more as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself I usually change the oil and wash the air filter and I had an occasion to have to change the battery once but I was really surprised that the brakes I wanted I do have the background I know what needs to be done and I know that the oil should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings and the lubrication system needs to be lubricated and so I stay on top of that but I wanted my front wheels I wanted the bearings packed and they wanted something like fifteen dollars a front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
just to pack the bearings? just to pack the bearings but what I found is that they had a brake job and they I had them the other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them do the diagnostics that's free and then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it
and they told me that my brake pads were seventy percent still good but still it was cheaper in the long run and so I just got the brakes done and I thought that was a good deal and plus
and they repacked the wheel bearings and they repacked the wheel bearings but I've had considerable experience you might say I'm uh good back yard mechanic and I took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but I still have a pretty good feel for it but one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars I had bigger cars and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those and what I was surprised at is that on my little nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand I have almost one hundred and ten so I drove on those brake pads for forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them so those small little trucks and cars like that the longevity of the brake pads is really good
they've gotten to the point where they don't weigh very much and the surface materials on the pads is so good
so I just did it anyway I like to stay up on it I just kind of stay up on it and then if you go and just about any point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is a white golden brown it's not dirty I keep it that way because that is the key to the longevity
it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that how
and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and in fact I have an eighty seven mustang with a three o two in it that I've beefed up a little bit
and one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels
the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum you're talking about the vibration dampener?
there's three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and the water pump pulley that's the vibration dampener
when I changed those over I put on these pressed aluminum things
and probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out
so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way but not far enough to notice
I was on my way to work one day and the water pump pulley split laterally in half
so there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and I
my exercise program consists of it's a opportunity to stay alive really instead of trying to exist on the good health of my youth
I'm and what I like to do is I like to stretch out and I like to run I like to run get my heartbeat up I like to run about two and a half miles and then I like to work out on the bailey life cycle machines up here at the holiday spa and I think that I've had a regiment now for about ten fifteen years of doing that and I kind of think it's a lot of work but I think it's a lot of work but I think it's the amount of effort that's required to stay healthy I have a sedentary job and unless you do something like that you're going to get sick
I need to get I'm pretty bad about that I'm lazy I should I know I always say that I need to start running and I'm going to try and do that this summer because I never have time I always put it off by the time I get back from classes it's late at night and I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever because I'm getting a gut here I got to get back into shape two years ago I started having trouble with my knee and I've got I figured it'll go away I've had to reduce my program and I've gained fifteen pounds
and so it's I need to get back into swimming instead of running if I can't run I should be able to swim I'm such a terrible swimmer and I really feel I can dedicate about an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort but if it gets longer than that I start not doing anything
so I got a real problem in that regard it do you obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
I do it I guess I'm going to do it because I want to get in shape it's not something I really enjoy all that much that I'll probably once I get into it and if I get into better shape then it won't be as much of a chore to me it's always a chore I started doing this when I was about thirty five
and now I'm fifty five
and I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense some health related thing is going to blow me away that's the same way I got too much weight on right now I need to lose fifty pounds
I need to lose at least twenty but it's just I'm busy I'm doing a lot of traveling and it creates a problem when you're on the road what other programs other than running? have you ever done anything at all?
I have sit ups or also last summer I was doing nautilus or last year I belong to a club right here got kind of expensive to renew they wanted another fifty dollars
that was a little bit too much money but doing a mix of nautilus and free weights I like that what club are you with? I'm sorry? what club were you with?
it's called city sports downtown washington so you're downtown
I go to george washington university you're down there on twentieth and eighteenth and f g
it's plaza I'd there's a holiday spa down there on k street something like that but I go to the holiday spa here in alexandria and that's pretty good but evening time it gets pretty busy but generally I can get in and get a program
but I need to rededicate myself to doing this and I got a problem ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
and I know it's going to bite me in the ass and so I really don't want to back off on it
it's something I think I'm young I should get started getting into shape I don't want to I want at one point it's going to be too late to do it when you're young you can abuse all your systems and you can recover
when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away and just wind up having to kiss your ass good bye and so the object
steve with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or what do you think?
that's a really hard question I do know that politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths I let's example our friend the president right now says no new taxes we should be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases so I know the politicians aren't straightforward in terms of economics I'm not it's hard to call it really is I never really thought that the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little I always that the real question is are we getting a reasonable return on investment for instance like social security tax or that's tax we're paying money and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us
so that's when I see that money taken out of my paycheck or every other week I really think that money's history and as far as return investment that's nothing
and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back someone was telling me that there's still an office staffed with people there and in d c that are researching to find a cure for polio which I may be wrong but I believe that the cure for polio is already founded but supposedly once you have an office in d c and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and they just haven't yet
I'm not exactly sure about polio in particular I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio
I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio that might be the difference I don't know the other thing that I remember seeing on t v lately had to do with it's like seventy five percent of the historical sites in america are in the home districts of very powerful people politically
for some reason historical sites with the full federal money and everything seem to appear almost as political favors to very strong politicians
it's funny because it was one of the things that bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where congress is able to attach all kinds of funny amendments for individual congressional districts to the main budget proposals
and the poor president has to either accept or reject the whole thing it sounds like you think that we'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto
I think the line item veto is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the president uses it to get rid of this kind of waste on the other hand it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president not to veto important things and just to get rid of the unimportant things
and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to where the boundary between waste and necessity is
so I'm not sure that that will help solve our problems but there definitely is a problem with I forgot there's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something
pork barrel politics
pork barrel politics there has to be some way to do it I know state governors usually have line item vetos and I lived in massachusetts for a while and when dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular but massachusetts when dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially
at least at the end I don't know I
they were very good at first they were in very good financials at first and that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well and then of course the bottom fell out it's tough there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations I guess you can raise taxes and then create job programs and whatnot or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot
and spare the economy it's a hard balance it definitely is even not for government even just for a small business I know some
I think actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have working for a large corporation and for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit
I think it's health care it's what I think everybody would say that
and if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you
the sometimes I think it's more important than salary
do you also get dental? and I don't know if I would rank that second but since I have three boys it can turn out to be important you know
I know in a given year dental expenses can really kill you
my husband is with northwest airlines and he gets the full health and dental and we have four children and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous
and I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it it's
or maybe they don't and then if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will
that's right that's right I guess that would be up there I'm not sure how I would rank that compared to retirement or pretax savings was another thing that I think is a great benefit
and I think it's really something that the government ought to encourage more because there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in germany and japan
it's a lot easier to save it when you don't get your hands on it first when you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do and
what about lesser benefits perhaps for you but for the women in the corporation for example leave?
do they have father leaves or anything like that? I don't think so yet they may have just plain parental leave which either one can take
I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short
I do too I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks
I think it's just a crying shame for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks and
she isn't recovered and the infant needs her desperately at that point and time there
there ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time
I agree it's so important to families then and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up especially in this day and age that
you don't want to start over again anywhere you're right I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I would most like to see changed the parental leave
I think they've come a long way at least some companies some of them my girlfriend that works for a rental car agency
and as manager they have a very very poor leave policy and I just don't know how women do it particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end they do it by shortchanging their kids there's no other way unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely that's right that's exactly right
people moving as much and it's just a terrible choice you shouldn't have to make it you're right and
one of the benefits we get of course is travel would I like to have that it's wonderful
the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere but you can't afford to stay once you get there listen I have friends in a lot of different cities if you just fly me there I'll take care of that
that's right you have to have an awful lot of fun just getting there has to be half the fun and I guess the go ahead
I think public service is a worthy thing and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as peace corps that promote that
probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts
I know that because my son is a scout now and is thinking about his eagle and in order to get eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world
and you have to do a public service project in which leadership is the key element
I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because it's talking about a requirement for public service
and of course the peace corps the boy scouts is a voluntary activity
I think that might be referring to something kind of alternative to the draft either you have military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years
of course military service falls under the category of a public service
and so one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
but I agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended there are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of
but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either more of a voluntary kind of thing
or for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative public service for young people to go into after high school
kind of in lieu of the draft for people who are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want to be in the military say you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things and it's interesting because I'm not a particular fan of the military but I have seen a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do and they come out and now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline and in some cases they have a greater self esteem because they can see that if I do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time I can accomplish a lot and it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they don't need to be cowboys they don't need to be out there constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
and for some young men that's good for me it would have been lousy idea because I did have the personal discipline
why? and I went to college for four years and got out
why is that? but for some people that's good I don't particular like the fact that it's the military and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as an instrument of u s policy
it's to defend the nation against external evils that's one view and that's another debate but it's
it depends on whether we figure that we have a defense oriented military or an aggression oriented military
and it seems pretty aggressive oriented you look at the last military action which was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states and it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe so at any rate this is getting off the topic but my point was that for people who don't want to do the military service it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and sense of community that the boy scouts
our discussion's about the care of the elderly?
that's right that's right what do you think is important? if you were I don't know how old you are but if you had parents or grandparents whatever it is who were ready who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for?
my dad's almost ninety and he lives by himself
and he's in good shape
but some friends of mine have gone through this I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and where they did some things to try to keep them mentally alive and where there were caring and compassionate people operating it
do you have any experience with this yourself?
my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in minnesota
and we go there once a year we tend to see her there cause we're in boston so we're pretty far away when we visit minnesota though we go to see her
and it seems the environment there I don't know too much about it but it seems nice enough it's hard at least half of the residents are not mentally sound so it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain clarity from the lack of stimulation you mean
I don't know we also my wife and I volunteer to go to a nursing home that's just a mile from our house she goes more often than I we used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there and we have a two year old son and so sometimes we'd take him with us and there I would say it's the same thing it's a relatively nice environment but again it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but certainly have retained all of their mental skills and so on it's must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really don't know where they are do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?
I think yeah I think they're relatively respectful and concerned in as much as they can be I've noticed some of the patients asking for things just repetitively but things that are not reasonable
and so at some level the
I'm sure that the staff learn what's normal for this person and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need it's possible I was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need
I'll tell you one thing though that I saw that was really nice we saw a husband and wife we used to see a husband and wife in there together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were
and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house so it gives them a sense of identity and so
you walked in there and it didn't look like how you walk into some rooms and it's completely generic there's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it but this room on the other hand they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like it must have been it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of security and I think part of what you're saying matches what I have read I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who were adequately deficient in their abilities physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves
but I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because they provide a lot of social activities
one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation and
temporary I that's new to me I I think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like put her in there and there's so much how many children do you have now?
I have five you have five?
you do have a hard time finding time then don't you?
four of them are grown they're in college or just out of college so I really have just a thirteen year old at home you sound so young
I work at it to have them I try to fool everybody I think you're doing a good job I just have one child
and I don't think there's not much I can do about it my wife and I are in our forties so
but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the pivot point of the universe
I think you are right because I was an only child too and that's one reason I have so many because I enjoy the big family
and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters and so she is sort of like an only child and it's the same type of thing I have a younger brother like that I'm in my forties like I say and I have a brother in his twenties
and I was the youngest
so I understand how that worked and he was treated like he had five fathers or something
that's exactly how it is she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her when things don't go right she just calls one of them
but it's a little bit difficult though I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more and did you all do a lot of organized things like little league soccer?
we really did not my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion she twirls a baton and we did a lot of things together
she and I did a lot of things together and flew we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform
and that was a lot of fun but I guess you could consider that organized there is a competition all the time
we were very heavy into that other than that they were pretty much and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that I think that's probably true the if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities
and if you have a large number of children then you don't
you can't afford to you and there's not enough time
my son is in little league this year he's ten and they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just if there were more than one child there would be no way to do it
that's right one parent go one direction and I'd have to go in the other and we could only cover two at that
I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter and my little one also competed because really she had no choice she had to go with me
so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was it was making the friends and going all the places and it was a really neat experience but it took our total time I did not work when I did this now I do work full time and it's just my thirteen year old and myself
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other so I don't think although I think three children is probably the ideal to me but I'm not sure I could afford three I most certainly couldn't educate three
I don't know how my parents did it
there were five of us and I don't recall wanting anything in particular but I don't know how my father did it he worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children but we did okay we had a house and a home and but now my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did and we only have one child
things cost a lot more I don't know how it is in georgia and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some atlanta is horrible
is it? we have a lot of people moving here from boston and different areas and from talking to them they're shocked
and they the housing is so cheap in comparison to boston that they jump on it
that's what I've heard they sell their house they stash away a good bit of money and come down here and I work with a lot of them they think they have really done something then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to where they came from
the housing is cheaper but that's about it I'm surprised to hear that I've heard very positive things about atlanta
how serious is the subject of crime in your area?
needless to say here in washington d c this is the war zone d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital
it's really bad here for example the local high school they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns
and they're starting to get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things
luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here
san jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the outlying agricultural towns because you end up having a lot of gangs forming largely around the hispanic core
it seems to be that gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions that's how they bind themselves together in groups I guess and
the interestingly enough I don't think we have here a lot of gangs not a whole large group of them but just a few most of them centered around drug territory
and so they're protecting their economic interests I guess
and nowadays the latest thing I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing cars at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just step up and take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house
that's efficient that's the latest thing that way there's no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want
they're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort
just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get in off they go with your car
it's I think they call it car jacking around here
I'd heard that phrase that's kind of the latest thing but every year in the d c area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here I'm from ohio and my wife's from florida so
and we've just come from twenty years in the military which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for us to have to put up with and it's really scary sometimes
there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays
and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school
and of course the mayor of d c is having a real problem trying to what do you do to reduce crime in a major city like d c where it's a way of life for everybody I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem I don't know what the solution is there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing
there's a couple of things that I've heard
most of them are fairly radical in terms of what you'd have to do
course the reason that these kids tend to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just the end results of poverty and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else
because the parents aren't making a living at anything
and they see all their friends and neighbors
and they're accidental parents half the time anyway and their friends are driving mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and I think to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised
it's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they say it's the law that's got to be changed instead of their way of life
so I don't know it's I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy
I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of an actual solution to the problem
the other social problems wouldn't go away
they've always been with us
there's been a lot of and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow think about this?
do you have children in school? I do
I have two that are now just about ready to graduate from college
but I also have two that are just entering school I think they're just pushing them entirely to fast so you see a big difference then in before and now do you or a lot of testing?
it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade
my son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock
and I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner I do too I think that's awful
and I have a preschooler I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten and I thought how mature do you have to be I know what's the new criteria
and there is a do you have the standardized testing now? we have all kinds of testing and it's over and over it's I t b s and just everything
and they test test test I live in plano actually and I don't know if you've heard of plano but it's a very transient community
a lot of people from everywhere it's just north of dallas
and it's grown in leaps and bounds we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now
and most of them from other places
j c penney's come down from new york and of course t I and xerox from rochester and we just have lots of people from everywhere lots of industry coming in
and it's a very wealthy community not that I am but other people seem to be
and I would love to know why but they do they have
you would like to know what they're doing I would I really would they just have beautiful beautiful homes and they have everything the kids only wear name brand things to school and it's one of these things
that makes it hard for you doesn't it it does it really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now and it does
we do it to a point but not to where she feels different
but some of them are very rich
it's hard to explain to them why you can't and so we just kind of have everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are
and so I don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is texas but the kids are expected to excel in everything
and it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first and they're expected to be
their parents expect it the teachers expect it texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system
and if you read national surveys they're far from it and so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests
how about the kids how are they coping with it? not very well they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests
they make a big deal to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this
I just feel they do better that way
rather than anticipating and
and I have older children too that now are out of high school and they've always done this here it's always been the same but it's getting worse and worse is more pressure for everything and I just think it's really awful and I'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but I think it's a very long day
it is and my feeling is that you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school that's right
my son came home and he said mom all we do is work we hardly ever play and and I don't think that's right I think we should do what europe does and include cultural activities in our school system
likewise I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano
I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well rounded kids not just book smart kids wouldn't that be great
and so I just find this a real problem I think if they're going to be there all day they should find time one of my daughters once was out of school with mono in her junior year and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead so what does that tell you? is that right? it tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time
and they could be using this time better
for example in my son's kindergarten they're really finished at lunch time after lunch they have some I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch and then they have naps or rest period
and I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting that's a very long day for kindergartners I agree but I think that working parents have kind of demanded this
I wouldn't be surprised because they don't want to send them to daycare I doubt if they would say it was too long that's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day
do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care? we have them at one school like
how do you feel about it?
I don't see any problem with testing for random drugs I myself almost am in favor of it I work at honeywell and I went through a standard drug testing thing before I was brought on
I think that's pretty standard at least at honeywell it is I think it's important to insure the quality and almost the goodness of character that kind of thing where do you work?
I'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon
and I just came from saint paul interviewing with three m
and they have a policy for testing if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start
and I guess the only drawback I can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem
but and that definitely happens the drug tests they're accurate but there's always that margin of error
and that's something to be aware of another thing is a lot of times they aren't that accurate they aren't that sensitive if you're on a prescription drug of some kind what are they going to do about that
I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for honeywell and I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
I don't know what program are you in over at carnegie mellon?
electrical engineering I'm a graduate student at u c f in florida university of central florida
and this is actually an internship up here
but even for interns they do the whole drug testing thing so
they test you before you start or before you even interview
or they essentially I sure don't they essentially made me the offer and then did the drug testing thing after that so it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests and then they essentially give you the offer
and then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
so there's some noise on this end I'm actually in a mall calling so
you probably wondered but
what happens if you were to fail? then do they give you one more chance or two more chances? that's a good question I believe from what I remember of the literature if you fail they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
but once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail but are you working right now anywhere or
I'm just about to finish my master's in may and just interviewing with companies right now
that was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening was going to honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there
and he's doing an internship with I b m
and they basically did the same exact thing we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time so one of those things where we went through kind of an identical process but
do they test you right now at work too? that's one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job
I think the unwritten rule is expect it but they don't do it
so that's good I guess I don't know I have gone to a couple of parties since that time and while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there smoking a joint or whatever
and that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up but they don't really do that so
is it formal policy that they said they might test?
I'll let you start I guess
I'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing and I've got some very definite opinions about it which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it but developed a little more but haven't changed that much what about you? are you involved at all? I'm not my employer does not do that although I had an ex employer that the previous job I used to have they a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
I don't know my feeling is that when there's immediate threat to life and limb should somebody be under the influence of drugs I'd be willing to support that for example train engineers
because there was an incident several years ago where an amtrak engineer
he crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana and I guess air traffic controllers I wouldn't want them to be on drugs and airplane pilots but where it's not necessary in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property I would seriously question it so
that's mine it I go back to me no matter how much our company claims it's not a constitutional issue that because this is between a company and an employee it is not a government it's not the constitution doesn't apply but it seems to me that it still should our company's doing it because they're a government contractor and so some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts and I'd so it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent?
and our company has taken that and gone all the way first off we don't have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they weren't so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even and
then and they so it's a complete random testing it's random in the sense that you don't know when it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested
and I sit at a terminal and write software all day it certainly has no life threatening capabilities in my job and
and I agree that there are jobs that are definitely life threatening and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper I agree there's also the issue of out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results or I shouldn't say high
I mean several percent
that I will give credit to our company for in that I think there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs and essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine or some it's not quite that simple but it's fairly simple kind of a coarse kind of test
coarse kind of test and then there's a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it's called the chemotography to determine exactly what the things are is that done
and now let me ask you this at the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any
I've been with this company for sixteen years now so this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this and
and it has they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody and at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't know but on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
how do you it sounds like you've got a television going on there I can assume that you probably watch the t v news is that
I almost never watch t v news I
I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio what station do you listen to?
it's a local radio station it's called k l I f cliff cliff I see it's not affiliated with anything is it it's not a network station
because I listen to public radio a lot and they have k c r w which they may be trying to start their own cable tv outlet they're getting a little feisty now
this station has a lot of just ongoing news
and occasionally in the morning I'll pick up something like c n n or that but I hate watching the ten o'clock news or so you have a paper or something or
we have dallas morning news which is the big paper in dallas
I read it pretty much from cover to cover
how do you like it? it's been a while since I read the dallas news fact last time I read the dallas news I was in arkansas I
the times herald went out of business here and so we really only have one dallas newspaper and one fort worth newspaper
that must be pretty bad how did that happen anyway?
financial trouble not how when did they when did it happen?
I guess they closed down about three months ago
how do you keep up? I read the times los angeles times there's quite a task if you've ever run into one they're
they're very voluminous they're thick
if there's something you want to know it's in the times and in detail we used to have two papers here in town and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of just nobody was buying it really
so there really is only one major l a now? pretty much there used to be the daily news which runs out of the san fernando valley
and they're not bad as far as a local paper goes in fact it was kind of weird because I met the editor while I was doing jury service in santa monica one time it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff he was a really cool guy went to columbia university and all this stuff and it's a pretty good paper but it's not the times
although I'm sorry to see some of their there's a daily news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're expanding I guess and occasionally I pick up time magazine or something if they've got an interesting lead story but it's I don't have time
I used to read time magazine a lot but I don't read it much anymore that's kind of a problem for them there's a lot of people who fall into that category
and then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the dallas morning news I see
the big dailies don't like to step much out of their home turf I have to admit the times is kind of provincial too it's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover
now they have started here running a three times a week plano section
and it's just sort of four or five pages that covers what's going on in plano but it's still not an awful lot of news I know it was a big discovery when the times found out there was a place called orange county
the way they've been handling it before they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the l a county border
I would imagine in dallas they have plenty happening in dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs and of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county
I find that attitude kind of arrogant though it's you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us
we in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to keep track of daily finances way back twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer I did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and checkbooks and all this kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it
that sounds about right so the only thing that we do now is I keep a little spread sheet of what I call the net worth calculation which is just the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth and I only update that maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in just to see whether or not we're getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what
that's really about the extent of the kind of financial score keeping that we're doing
it's kind of difficult for me because right now like most teachers I'm laid off and that's terrible
so I spend most I substitute a lot
so it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances
but I know how much I have to bring in a month and that's about it that's about as far as we go and then anything extra is more or less split up between all of us and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day
I see are you married? are you living with people that you're sharing expenses?
I'm a single mother I have three children I see
so right now we get aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it and my ex husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support
so right now I know what I'm getting from the state and I have to balance more or less what I get from the state with my bills and try to work as many days as possible any time they call me in
but I still have to figure out if I work too many days then I lose all my state aid and if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills and it's like a juggling act every single month
this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation I see
so the four days before they only have a four day week
and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in I see
they don't like to be absent before a vacation
but I'm shopping around as far as trying and getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts
my kids are in boy scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the boy scouts because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me so it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit but we do a lot of robbing peter to pay paul I guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle class americans are in you're the first my next door neighbor just lost his job in one of these
his company went bankrupt actually it was a subsidiary of an outfit called u s shoe or something it was a computer subsidiary I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company
but they just folded it up and told him to they took the top management and gave them jobs at the corporate front office
and everybody else was sent packing
hang on one second I've got
somebody was knocking on my door here it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present it sounds terrible to say but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be in terms of keeping score of input and output
do you have a computer at home or we do and we try to
I keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in every single day I'm at the computer I see
and it's what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet
do you use a standard spread sheet or
let's see how about about ten years ago what do you think was different ten years ago from now?
I would say as far as social changes go I think families were more together they did more things together
they ate dinner at the table together the parents usually took out more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity
although I'm not a mother I still think that a lot has changed since ten years ago what do you think about that? we
actually ten years from today seems rather short
but I do agree that generally society has sort of rushed everything ahead
and I don't know it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently but I think that has a lot to do with economic situation
what about as far as social changes in the individual? do you think that the individual has as much time as they did ten twenty years ago?
it depends it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too I just
how old are you? I'm twenty eight
twenty eight I'm twenty three
so there's maybe a five year gap between us
I think that things have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are placed and that usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
and now it's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work
do you think it's an economic necessity or do you think that we're all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living? I think that's part of it too but I do think
do you think people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs or I don't
I don't think that but then there are a lot of people that don't have that but that really do need to work
I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive and then there is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that they think is surviving which is really more luxuries
but I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
so you think it's which group are you saying is the one trying? I'm saying that the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the people that have the higher standard of living
because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing middle class in this country I think that that's in my opinion the case
I have met people that just want to maintain the standard of living and those that really need the job
and then sometimes I often find that maybe there's so many different things available to us a microwave a v c r a answering machine a dishwasher a refrigerator and some of those items for the
I guess we're sticking more to social changes but people want all of that
and not all of those are necessities so they're trying to it has become a necessity
we're supposed to talk about recycling basically what your personal opinion is on it this is really for a speech research project they're doing so I don't know florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it?
they just kicked it off down here in sarasota county they did?
they had been doing it they started first in sarasota city which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually
and they've got these not quite
they've got these it's county wide program now
and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage yard trash plastic cans and glass and then paper
which in the paper it's just newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing you're supposed to put in there
no slicks that's good let me ask you this do they require you to presort it?
that's something in minneapolis they're really strict on in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really tightly but when I lived in orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there
and they'd just sort it out for you
it was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am so
I talked to this girl she's an acquaintance of mine and she's involved with what is the name of that company it's not amway but it's the other big vitamin company? shaklee
and she's just shaklee crazy because it's her business and everything
and she asked we were talking one day and she asked me a couple of questions what she said that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they don't want it to change their lifestyle and especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything
that's what recycling at home sorting does
it's a little extra work
and it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do here in sarasota county is they've got it can
you put your garbage in a garbage bag and you set it out by the curb
if you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb you got to tie them up and everything
the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it's about a foot and a half deep and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long
this is a little container
and then they have another one the same size that one's red then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods
and so you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and if you've got food containers or anything like that it's a big problem it is a big hassle so not only do you
that's true up here they give you one of those containers and you put everything in it
so it's like if you use a lot of stuff you it's like if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place this is true so it's kind of a pain in the butt
this is true but I don't know that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you have those garbage people that make twenty thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting and maybe come up with a better system
make it a little more convenient but
they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here if you want to have a nice garbage can
and it's on wheels and it's big you can actually rent those? that's interesting
up here the city provides them kind of like
I think in the city they do but out here in the county you have to rent them
and they just add it on to your water bill or something so where exactly are you in terms of sarasota? are you north of sarasota or east east of sarasota
and sarasota is on the west coast? south of tampa? I'm
about an hour south of tampa that's
I listen to this talk radio station down here and it's really they I don't if you ever listen to talk radio but those guys they just kind of get into stewing up trouble with the callers and things like that occasionally
but they get into some really good conversations sometimes and some of it sometimes it's serious and they have some good feedback and all that stuff and from listening to that I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with
and this kind of fits into the aid program the welfare program that's going on right now and it's
I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't and looking back on it I tend to think it was mostly a mistake
on the other hand the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental decisions any one of which was sort of understandable at the time
but on the whole I think it probably was the wrong thing to do how about you?
I was just in high school when it ended
ended up being I was in the last lottery
and I was glad it was over by then
I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there just because we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like
we those people that I know I work with several that were over there and for some of them it was just kind of not so much a holiday I guess that's how they tend to talk about it but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come back and
but that they weren't really allowed to do anything I to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway it's funny tonight I was helping my kid with an essay on stalin
and I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in world war two the personalties of stalin hitler and churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was almost a personal struggle among these three I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense
they're certainly all leaders and with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them
and I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the early decisions of the vietnam war that the people saw the cold war as you had to draw a line and defend it otherwise they'd get you someplace else
looking back it seems like that was only partly true that there might have been a better place to draw the line I guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end but I don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him and I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward and we were wrong
but I like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where and as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing to a completely and winning it whatever that would mean
I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't prepared for I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war
the other wars seemed like a valiant war they seemed like a valiant thing
you knew who was good you knew who was bad
and it was a traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you know whichever way it is you're not
but in the vietnam war it seems like it was the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad and the it's ambivalent
it seems like even the people had the south vietnamese the north vietnamese and the laotians and the cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved but what about the domestic effects I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government and they that pendulum started to swing maybe even too far to the point where supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the vietnam war on
and that tradition is still it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to this desert storm stuff may have killed it
but I think that was one of the biggest that the domestic unrest
I get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to all things considered on national public radio that is one of my big sources for current events information I really like that coverage my wife on the other hand is home most of the day and she watches a lot of the cable news network have you ever heard of all things considered?
we don't have the national public radio in my area
I can hear it at the college town nearby when I'm in stillwater which is about an hour away but the f m signal doesn't reach this far
I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit it gives you a whole different perspective on the news when you hear it from a european point of view or from the country of origin
I agree with you too on the cable channel c n n and headline news I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper which is why I rely on shortwave and then the cable c n n
I'm interested in the shortwave aspect of it how do you find that the coverage from other places in the world compares with the american coverage of how do you think that the viewpoints differ?
I think a lot of it is just the fact that in the u s you're so far removed in a lot of cases from conflicts or it's not happening in your backyard
so it's not as personal the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than what's on shortwave b b c is almost they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it
and it just they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions do you think then that the american media is presenting an opinion along with their facts?
very much so very much so and I think a lot of it is especially t v news they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to really decipher the news and to really explain it
I think it's important to interpret it but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting which approach do you find to be more useful the interpretive approach or the straight reporting?
I like the straight reporting and then I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it
I always think it's humorous when the president gives the state of the union for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
and a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they write into it
so overall I think I would rather hear just straight reporting one of the things that I found interesting last year during the gulf conflict was a sentiment against peter arnett who had stayed in iraq and was presenting some of the things that were available there was a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was being severely censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that this isn't a baby milk factory how could he say it was I think that to me showed that the americans were really getting used to having not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
I think people have that opinion they want to sit down in front of the tv or read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs and find out
I say they probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink they're innocent I see a good southern solution
how do you feel? that's of course being facetious but you'd have to say that
I don't know the things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing
and seems to me that I think that's the way it's done now at least my understanding of the law which isn't very good
it seems to me that the judge does it and I think that's probably all right in that they maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing
and I guess also what the system will absorb
probably more tuned in to that possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty
I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole he could have a personal prejudice judges are people like everybody else even though they're supposed to be impartial that's right
but maybe and I think that may be an exception as well because I think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge?
I think that's the way it is
they decide whether or not the accused or whatever would get the death penalty do they have a death penalty in california? in fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month
and there's a big uproar going on right now
the governor has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not
it's someone who had killed two teenage boys here in san diego as a matter of fact
I something like that I've got no problem with it
I guess the way I think about it it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge it's just like if you've got a dog that's running wild and biting people
put it to sleep just get it out it's not able to fit in something inexpensive
I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just
if somebody gets the death penalty they're judged guilty they got the death penalty they should have one year and one appeal cover all their bases with one appeal and if not don't let them sit up there on death row for fifteen years I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years
that but I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those I'm sure
the other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again I think is the way it is now that all verdicts
maybe not I don't know at least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous I believe it is in capital
I think in lesser cases it's ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever how ever many is sitting on a jury
I believe that's the way it is but I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial and that there's one juror that is different than the other eleven
and they've only deliberated four hours or something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked
and the judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet
I'm telling you go one way or the other that's probably an expensive trial six months so far they said probably
probably I'm not sure there's a number it's probably thirty forty thousand dollars a day worth of all the free for all maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote
that's been so long I've practically forgot who noriega was
that has been going on my cousin is a f b I agent down in miami
so she follows that stuff pretty closely but that's interesting
she's not involved in that case but she does have you ever served on a jury?
I haven't I never have my wife has but I haven't I got called but I never got selected for a jury
I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process
and they had some guy that was defending himself
and you say you have some strong feelings about the issue?
I do as far as immigration as a whole goes
I think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
I there just is not going to be room for all of us we don't have jobs now I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time I hope you're one of the employed right now I am one of the unemployed right now
I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company and I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications
and I know that there are a lot of foreigners here doing my line of work
and of course I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
how do you feel? I'm a little bit ambivalent and I think one of the problems with immigration policy like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in terms of what really is driving it they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with issues of race and things like that right now I believe there are two policies that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually one is at the high end they always want to be able to do some brain draining they always like to be able to attract the einsteins or the professor chou or
they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that at the bottom end they are always willing to let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area
those are two things that I think are going on although I don't think the politicians would tell you that
and I think you're right in both cases and then the third thing is the political aspect of letting steam come out from under the lid in mexico
they can not close off the mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would spill over to this country
so they keep allowing the pressure cooker to let off steam
and I think probably it's pretty important right there how do you feel about haitian immigration? that's one of the few things I found myself in agreement with pat buchanan I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into society they're very difficult group to find jobs and places for and so I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem in that they're pretty miserable where they are but I'm not to sympathetic about letting large numbers of haitians in
actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here
and it would have nothing to do with political situations it would have to do with poverty but if you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but politically and economically
have you been to southern florida? I know about it it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans twenty years ago
and the two of them together we can it's just as well it's hardly america anymore on the other hand the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than our first generation immigrant so there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
but there's some differences in the immigrants that we're getting now
I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
I think probably a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
but the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into america
they don't bother to learn our language and first of all they I really feel strongly about this
we send a lot of money to mexico not very good it's not been a good day
I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon I don't know I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with carolyn so I hope she's turned it in
are you eating? I go ahead I'll stop eating I just barely got home from the university it's say what? I just barely got home from the university
tell you what we can do is I can punch the one
and then after five minutes when the voice comes on we can talk all night if we want go ahead fire away
I love the irony of talking about this subject on april the fifteenth
but I'm afraid I'm probably in the minority I actually don't think that we pay too much in this country particularly in this part of the country I agree with you
I guess I do have a bone to pick with the way taxes are distributed I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
and the sales tax can't I think that's regressive and it's kind of dumb I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax but on the other hand I don't mind that it's only on things that aren't like groceries and that it's not on that
nobody taxes groceries they do where? in arizona is that right?
but we have a pretty low tax rate here I think the sales tax they just got to do something about it
but that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
but I guess when I see the comparison between the united states and any other western country their rates are forty one forty two and ours are thirty six thirty seven if you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well there's no other country that is taxed as low as we are and I still think that having lived in europe for awhile difference in living conditions are certainly well worth what we pay for it
I'm not sure I understand what you mean I think I was in germany for several years
and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there
you mean lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes higher taxes
I suppose that's true probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever but still's that way to some extent
I think the other problem is it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you theoretically can do something about
but I look for example and you're not quite in the same situation but school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world
I wish I didn't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes
since I send my kids to parochial school that that's probably a little tougher on you
it's not quite the bargain that
but I pay them gladly that's a decision I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money but that's the way americans want to interpret it I guess that's all right but I
and if I were when I was single and again when I'm retired I will not mind paying what it takes to keep the schools good
that's always been a high priority I think that's just you though
I do that's true I think in places like california people are beginning to find that in areas that are fairly well off if you add the people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are just looking for fun people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens
and there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done
that seems like a cultural lapse people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they of course I think with the graying of america we're going to see that problem in lots of places
people would rather increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them but I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted or build roads
I guess it's an easy one for me I think there's something seriously wrong
what is it that you are particularly upset about? I think they've lost their compass and I'm not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore but I voted with my feet and my kids go to parochial school
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in the public school system? one hundred percent of the customers care that's one thing everybody cares about the education the kids are getting and they take an relatively active part if you're sending two thousand dollars that way every year you watch what goes on and you pay attention and participate and you can influence the way things are
so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of real estate or other taxes and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen? the immediacy just isn't there
and I also think that one of the problems and actually I think this is a cultural problem the problem with public education is really a problem with the culture and I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed people are reluctant to pass school tax levies even when the money is needed or would be well spent because they don't have kids in the schools
I think that's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids I think that's the principal problem is that people no longer see it as their problem and there's an immediate problem
it troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes at the local level or bigger votes at the national level
it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
I believe that the original idea of public education in the united states which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution it barely made it I think it was added afterwards I think the principal was education for civic participation
the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes
it has taken on a more profound economic thrust that's exactly what I was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization and I think that one
I'm glad that you added that one I think that one's significant that's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor and then I quit and got disabused of that notion but the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs and I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and I'm really sad to say this I never thought I would have but I really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem and that's why I'm sort of reluctantly in favor of these choice programs
I agree with everything that you've said so far and the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact with public school teachers than perhaps you are except as a parent of your child and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related that's what like consumer
have you ever served on a jury?
I've not I've been called but I had to beg off from the duty and you? I was called and then I was not chosen
I was originally chosen primarily because I was a young fellow and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict I don't know why something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago
it's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason and they kind of liked me I looked and all that stuff and they I don't know what they saw in me but they saw it but back to the issue is I don't know at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun but there too there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly in civil cases in criminal cases I'd like to see the unanimity remain but in civil cases I think a majority rule by jury would be sufficient could you give me an example of a case where you think that?
in a criminal case one in which there is assault or some such I think there ought to be a unanimous vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this and in civil law there is such a thing as misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that a majority rule would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases I don't know if I'm making any sense or not I think are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more tangible or
often there's more incriminating evidence for instance and also too I think I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more serious in a criminal case do you think that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up?
I really can't say for certain truth be known as it stands there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both in a civil and criminal case the documentary the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that I don't know if you're familiar with that or not I'm not
a fellow when he was much younger was tried and convicted and sentenced to death fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked so he served out his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system the case was reopened and he was exonerated I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served
many laws but little justice but and I also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that just the process of picking jurors is not always objective
certainly not certainly not and they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers desires the because you get up and they ask you a few questions both sides do and then you're either challenged which is each attorney can use that as much as they like or I think it's a limit now they probably have a limit now but they pretty much go through that and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve for me it was financial hardship but onto the thing I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing it was always my impression that the justice himself or herself had the final say
let's talk about the wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it what do you think? is pennsylvania kind of out of line there?
actually I don't think they're out of line devil's advocate possibly but you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether or not you agree with that law you're still circumventing it you are legal in your circumvention of that law what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying income tax on something that you purchase mail order?
I don't think that's a valid argument I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax naturally some things you just can't find in your local k mart or bryn mawr stereo dealer but then why not pay the sales tax corporations have to why should an individual just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax? it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when I purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania it's because the commonwealth of pennsylvania
it's because I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so I go outside the area for that and I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though the revenue stream went to another state I don't think that that's my responsibility as a conscientious consumer
I'll agree it's not your responsibility is it also legal for you to do that?
from what I understand from various net readings the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes into place in the next few years it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get with something like that do your arguments still apply? I think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then I don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that I bought this out of state I need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania
which is exactly what businesses do at the present but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer
and I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having to pay sales tax on it
that's my understanding of the way it works usually the person ordering doesn't pay but the accounting department will suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay and there are some substantial nasty penalties if businesses try to avoid that do you mean businesses from the point of view of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax? or purchasing
businesses if purchasing things mail order
if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see this great deal on forty six mother boards from utah I might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax my accounting department will at the end of the month I think that's the way things work in pennsylvania and I know they work that way here in d c I'm unfamiliar with that because I never see that end of the business
so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something can be avoided
that's true a big hole does exist right now in that consumers can just say I forgot that there is no well defined mechanism at all and that it is a loss is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just in order to gain the revenue that's being lost I don't know if I agree with that but
jonathan you say it's near and dear to your heart buying a car is something you're contemplating I take it fantasizing about
can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family
and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago
it's got a five year loan so that's still got a couple years to run
and the car I get to drive is a nissan sentra that's going to be ten years old next month so I think about sprucing that up in a couple years if I can they get
what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next?
since I just turned forty I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car something real sporty
but realistically with the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat
something a little seating room how about you? I think the next car we get will probably be a I like buicks we have a buick century now it's a nineteen eighty seven
and whatever I get I want to have air bags both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody rather than have them stoop down to get over so I think the four door is probably a major requirement
and other than that reasonable cost and safety and as much economy as you can get out of a car I'm not looking for one with a great big engine
something that will carry it around careful is best way to describe it right now we've got a v six and that seems to be just fine I know they're coming out with some v eight now and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age
I was surprised to hear that the v eights are coming back so they've got some pretty powerful sixes
and v eights seem to be a return to the days of ten or twelve miles a gallon I drive a ford truck I like trucks because they're spacious and it's handy to haul things it's not related to my business I just really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that and it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one
is traction much of an issue for you up there traction?
not really it's a two wheel drive truck and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway
actually pretty good way of looking at it we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago
a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that
haven't had any problems since what make is the mini van? it's a mazda mazda I see
and we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and driveability fuel economy isn't great being a mini van but it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and it's got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around
so we've been able to do some real creative load hauling when called upon one of my sons has a plymouth van or that same type of thing the voyager
and they have a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff and of course as he gets friends I'm sure that will be even handier so I know if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
I think that we're going to be owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of high school anyway what about all wheel drive? is that something that you'd be interested in or is that
I'd be satisfied with a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the sentra
and even as light as that is with the small tires it's done pretty well in winter
again like you if conditions are that bad I probably don't want to be driving anyway
so I know I'd be happy with a reasonable four door again we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
actually to tell you the truth I think jury selection is a prime discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on finding of guilt
I certainly can't argue with that definitely does need some improvements
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to I think there's a limit on that the peremptory challenges are limited to I don't know how many I think it's four or five but you can
I can't remember which I was on a jury trial last year only I got kicked out as the last selection that the defense got it seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things I think I have a severe demeanor or something
that but typically everyone gets involved in the jury process and I suppose an elitist might say you really want someone who is well educated to be able to winnow the facts from the prejudice
but it still has to be a group of your peers
so if it's your peers and you're not educated then so if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd have to have nincompoops to
you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them
so that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
so I think the jury selection process is pretty neat but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards
I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have you're talking about the person's already been found guilty
and many times I've seen on trials they have on t v the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but I think that it should be up to the judge and the lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system
and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure I suppose you may be right on that
matter of fact I've heard that some of the information is prevented from reaching the jury like mitigating circumstances or preceding criminal record or things of this nature that
preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime but when it comes to sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury is it? I didn't realize that
at least in california they're supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background
but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down I think that they should
I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring so what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them
if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time
so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing I'm all for that for small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things what about white collar crimes like theft of trade secrets
I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are like what? embezzlement
you get a guy down the street who comes up carrying a
what kind of experience do you have then with child care?
I wonder if that worked does it say something?
I think it usually does you might try I don't know hold it down a little longer and see if it does it usually make a recording or I don't remember
it seemed like it did but it might not I guess we can start
I don't have any kids she just had a baby he's about five months old and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different do you have kids? I have three
I do I don't work though but I used to work when I had two children
I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care
but does your sister live in a big community?
she lives it's a fairly large community she got real lucky though he had a boss who moved into a larger office
and she's able to take her baby to work with her
and it's a small office that she works in
and it's a legal office and it's just one lawyer
and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office there's no one else that works there
and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby so it works out pretty good for her
how lucky I know a lot of people around here sometimes have mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids
but the community I'm in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to
so it's fairly safe to get references and that but I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center simply because there's so many kids and so many
worried that they're not going to get enough attention? and colds and things like that get spread real easy and things
and they're expensive and course there's a lot of different types of day care available too where they teach them academic things
or they just watch them and let them play and things like that but take a long time to find the right place
and you don't always even know if it's going to be the right place or not
anything could happen
I guess after he gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care when he starts toddling around and stuff
when she can't keep control of him and he starts crawling that's it would be hard I think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around
but seems like what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang at the wrong time but
I think she has problems with that too when you have kids will you work? do you work now? I don't know
that's something I've considered
I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time
is that what you do? I teach my kids at home so I'm here all the time
so they don't go to school is it like what's that called it's correspondence school they do it at home that's interesting
do you have to have any special training? not it depends on the state you live actually some laws absolutely prohibit it some states say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet say that and I'm not a certified teacher I went to college but my kids are only elementary levels right now and so
so they haven't been to public schools at all one of them was for a couple of years and so my oldest he was and then my youngest two have never been but we don't so you've never had
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
not too bad really I had a razor that I got from christmas that I really didn't want it but I got it anyway and it was a braun and they were real good about taking it back it wasn't a problem at all so I was able to get that back pretty easily
but I don't know I really haven't returned a whole lot lately have you? I haven't had to it's the every so often I'm almost pushing it myself maybe I'll buy a shirt from g I joe's and it shrinks too much and say I should have known better I bought it from g I joe's
and it was probably made in china by slaves
but they most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway I get pretty good stuff
I think that aside from the fact all markets being internationalized
and if you want to buy american it takes real extra work to find
it's probably a japanese or a burmese company owning and hiring people in the u s I was reading
I was reading something in consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars and about how you'd like to buy an american car maybe
but the transmission may be made in japan or whatever
I've got an eighty six ford ranger and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi
so it's what are you going to do?
but that's the way it is I don't know I personally feel that if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them that's the way it goes and more than manufacturers should get a clue and they should start making quality products I think they're beginning to the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away and
that's what I thought too until I saw the consumer reports issue
they've got all the cars rated and essentially I don't see much of a trend just every other time that you look at it the honda accords and the civics are right up there there's nothing wrong with them and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy and they're pieces of junk I know still at it
that's eighty six through ninety one
but I don't know maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue they got a three year lead time it probably won't start really showing up until ninety four or so
that's just it technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until quite a few years down the road but the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer
because technology is so volatile and changing all the time and can you think of any other industry where in software they
if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail
or maybe I say you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade
it they keep up with it pretty quickly and that's a real good thing I guess
I don't know and the hardware all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the macintosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I b m and the rest of the d o s world to follow along
they're kind of the leaders right now I used to see all those commercials for windows and you're they're reselling a macintosh under a different name
why don't they just say almost a mac for half the price
they'd sell more if they were honest
almost is the key word there too because I've used both and I really don't see an advantage of windows at all it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure d o s base that's true too
but I don't know I've gotten a little bit out of the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home I do use a mac at work but I really don't do much with it at home
but apple's sort of making a and they're ones were growling consumer need to worry about the mac they're getting if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive
you sound like you must work in the computer business I have one I do desktop publishing at work and I have a machine at home and I belong to the user's group and I've been a mac fanatic since they came out
but technically I'm not actually in the industry I don't work a computer company I'm an abuser
that's all right but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to keep up with the changes as they happen that's true
something that I find uncomfortable is you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for let's take the example the modem for
what baud rate do you get? it used to be that you get a twelve hundred actually
I don't think I'm in the majority in texas I don't think I agree with
you don't believe in it? I wouldn't say that I think I would have said that a few years ago
when I was younger I thought it was a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have capital punishment but maybe slowly changing my opinion
I'm not thoroughly opposed to it I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought
you sound a lot like a friend of mine a girl I hang out with
she has very black and white opinions there's no gray in her opinions she probably would agree more with you but I don't know I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again I've never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family
but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done
and we see that more and more in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl
that's fourteen years old what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult I certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose
I'm not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail but
it doesn't but it costs less that's a factor
and to me it is I work and I pay my taxes and I lived out in texas for a little while and they're and that's a pretty heavy state compared to georgia you guys are a lot more for to each his own even than we are in georgia
but even in georgia that's the attitude for the most part if I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine
but when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore
I the cost is something but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime
and I guess I would like I don't know the european countries certainly none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a crime problem either
you can't they don't execute anybody in britain or france and I don't believe they do in germany or italy either and they don't have the crime problems we do I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
I guess what worries me about capital punishment is when I see people enthusiastic about it and sort of bloodthirsty I think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing and that bothers me
you might be right but it but
I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch
I would never in a million years want that job
but I do believe it's necessary and I
on the one hand I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
and I couldn't pull the switch but actually I the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else I think it just becomes a symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians so
I would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed
like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country
I'm not so sure of that I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing?
I guess I'm my view of my I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that costs and other factors justify executing people
maybe it's more a symbolic gesture than anything else and I've also never been a victim although I have two friends whose wives were murdered and I can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
if it ever touched my
before the one will take let's see I guess I can start we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing
are you really? so I'm looking at something larger than what we have we've got an eighty four charger that's about gone and an eighty nine horizon so I'm looking for something bigger
which are both kind of small we were thinking mini van for a while and we're looking at some just four door five passenger sedans as well
are you looking for an american car or you open to buying foreign cars? I don't really have a preference either way
it I guess the american cars had a bad reputation but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had
personally I have a japanese car right now and I really like it a lot I think the japanese really build good cars
and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole buy american keep american auto workers working right now but I feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our car manufacturers have for a while
if I were to buy another car I would be partial to buying another japanese car but I would also look at american cars but when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also and I just felt that the japanese car was a much better product even if it's just details it seems like they so if I were
I there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while it's clearly just a design problem there
it is I'm kind of right now the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car I would really like to have a sports car I don't have a family so I don't need a mini van or such to haul people around in
so I'm looking for more a two passenger car that like a miata or something like that?
I like the miata but I don't like it enough to buy it I would buy something actually the car that I really like right now is an eagle talon which is an american car
but something along that lines interesting
because I have an economy car right now which is okay but I think I'd like to move on to something a little better
that's interesting I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for size and safety and then mileage probably
that's when I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage and I was looking for dependability and something that was going to last a long time for the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was worth that money
I think in terms of computer terminology I look at price performance and things like that and then a little bit at life expectancy
but it depends on what you pay initially
but I've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the charger that's right actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
and she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton
it's we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it but
I've had one or two american cars I think and they were okay I had a pontiac once and I never had a problem with it but my mother had a dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a dodge just from
actually I had a dodge omni at one point
and that was what really prejudiced me against american cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality car
I guess you'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car that's interesting but it's hard to beat some of the I guess in particular we're looking at a ninety one corsica buy back at a g m sponsored auction but I think they're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to g m after they've used it for six months and put twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it
and you can get those for eight thousand bucks if you
which is a good deal because I guess ninety twos granted but the new ones
fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot
so all the depreciation has been taken off and the dealer comes out okay
that I don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it but I don't know
I'm sure they did we keep looking at that mini van it's just we can get a caravan at twelve five
but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now but it's interesting but I don't know if it seems to be so
I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been it let's put it this way we've got the new england patriots up here so
they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years
why? partly due to ownership victor kiam owned the patriots for a period of a number of years
and he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something and they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth and it recently was sold to some other people so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and keep the patriots in the new england area anyways
it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you
I've been to a few games before you're from texas
so you've got two football teams down there
it depends on where you're from in texas I live right by dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned I see
that's how it is there's that type of segregation? it's divided
it really is so we've got our cowboys here and I don't think anybody roots differently but I have a boyfriend that lives in fresno do you
and he is for the raiders l a raiders so do you follow professional sports at all?
I just started to this year because of these silly raiders that didn't do very well
but I've been trying more this year I think I know a little more than I use to
I never knew very much at all so I'm trying it's a good past time
particularly football they say football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that men take out their frustrations by watching football and they get together with a bunch of guys and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the male bonding and the male instincts or something about the
so I shouldn't even try to do it? it's good in terms of a contest
I think that I personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport it has the speed
and the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey not everybody can play hockey
so we and that's we're a big hockey area up here I bet up here in new england as well as in the minnesota area but I don't even think we have that in texas what hockey? we might do we?
you probably know I don't know there's no hockey there's no
nobody talks about it so I don't think we do there's no professional hockey teams in texas
and we have a soccer team that comes and goes we don't even have that very much so I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now
they have this world football league you see we have the n f l that dallas and houston are in and new england patriots and l a raiders and those teams
there are those teams that play in national football league but now they have what's called the world football league and they have all these teams from there's a team in london and there's other european teams
and there's teams in the united states and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really overkill
and there's only so much football you can watch
I like to do I don't like to watch that's good I don't like to watch anything so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff I think it's an excuse to do nothing
and I can see what you're saying about the male bonding and the guys get together
and that's kind of cool that's fun
but it can get really overdone have you ever been to a professional football game? I have have you?
I have did you do the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole
actually that's what you got to do we talked our
I've done that for college football
you the the same thing
we talked our wives there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games and we talked our wives into going with us one time and they had a real good time and it was basically for the social atmosphere
and that's the thing you go three or four hours before the game you go set up we set a table up we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more
but that whole it's not so much the contest itself and the game itself but it's the whole atmosphere of going to a game
that you miss sitting home in your parlor with a six pack of beer and some potato chips
that's right you miss that
that's right and any professional sport I think you miss that
the atmosphere of being there
in high school I went to every football game and I twirled
and I didn't I still don't know that much about football obviously but I still had a good time you want to go first?
you can start one of the things they talked about was what do we think about a judge making the decision?
and I really don't agree with that I think that the trial by jury is better having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time
you know what I mean?
this topic is kind of mute
there's no way we couldn't survive in a trial system without a jury
one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case that's it
every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult I feel the other thing too they were saying what new ways could it change the system I really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal
if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught point blank in the crime there's no question
it's beyond a reasonable doubt all these things we've gone through this over and over again
they shouldn't allow an appeal and it can go on for ten twenty years
I think this is a little ridiculous
I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers
that's right I work for a law firm I'm serious and I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today with plea bargaining if someone is ill
plea bargaining is a different story
plea bargaining is something completely different that actually prevents trials or at least speeds them up I know that's what I'm saying but I think all of the whole criminal system is messed up in that regard people who commit crimes that they I don't know how it works exactly but they get lesser sentences
and I understand that the jails are full of people and that they have to do something
but I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
you know what I'm saying? that a lot of states don't have capital punishment
and I think they should
we do and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and all
they're caught dead to rights I just think that they've taken a life and they should pay for it with their life
when you're saying as far as the appeal procedure was concerned
we just have the case I'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry
his last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up
so his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession it
but that was absurd there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence I know that
and I don't know what would you do to change it? to make it better?
the only I the appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd there's no way that could work I don't agree with that at all
but imagine the guilt that person would have burned out
there's no possible way that you could feel good about yourself
if you had to do something like that day after day
no one would want the job not really
and like I said everyone has their opinions about every case do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights
I feel that everyone is entitled to a trial by jury that right supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you
were there witnesses? in other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were
that you can't remove the jury regardless of the case
you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
and there's still mitigating circumstances I
what are your benefits like at your job and how do you feel about them?
pretty good actually I work for hewlett packard and they have a pretty good benefits package in fact they're kind of known for having good benefits the pay isn't fabulous although I saw a survey recently and I'm making actually over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me that's good what kind of a degree have you got?
I've got a bachelor's in electrical engineering so
and I'm not a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff
anyway our benefits are pretty good we've got stock purchase program and a that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a pain
but there's a four o one k plan for sheltering some taxable income
there's how long have you been with them?
I've been with them for seven years that's good
and the best thing is four years or five years you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything
so it's not but there's several medical plans to choose from that cover pretty much everything I don't get sick that often so I don't pay much of it and I pay five dollars every time I visit the hospital
they don't cover eyes though and I have contact lenses so that's kind of a pain
but I can live but for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered
so that you've got small things to gripe about
and that sounds like you must feel really good about it
and the dental plan is fabulous the dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because
I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that
but that's not the case
so I guess nothing it's fabulous
the what about you? I work in washington at the naval research laboratory I also have a part time job at a law firm and I get no benefits from them at the part time work although they pay better per hour than my sort of quote real job does
and benefits through the government are really they're not the greatest before I got my degree
I'm a computer scientist
and before I got my degree I had done paralegal work for law firms here in washington
and at that time I was in gravy city the law firms in this town for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties
and benefits were just amazing
and we had everything paid for and with the government it's not quite that nice a deal but it's okay what we have to do is we have to pay about twenty percent of our costs and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing and the plans that are available to us range from kind of mediocre to really sweet so I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good plan at this point but it could be better that's for sure but there are other things that you get when you work for the government in terms of more relaxed atmosphere
it's really nice for me anyway to be able to work in a research atmosphere where I don't have to worry about academics or anything like that and so I'm really kind of happy about that end of things it's
one of the things with my company is that they've got a reputation for a lot of job security and there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions in the san francisco bay area that they do
so there's I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company
and I haven't had to move my residence to do that I still live in san jose and that's fabulous
it that's interesting because I have a cousin whose husband works for hewlett packard up in the massachusetts area he lives in andover
and the work that he he's specifically an engineer and does work with the hewlett packard machines that do sonographic imagining
and I've been over to see his complex over there and it's amazing
it's all ecologically designed and he seems really really happy with the set up and
in fact I know a guy who works at andover who I used to work with out here
and he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position kind of interesting anyhow
having sort of the reason we're going through the school system I seem to be younger than most people who talk on this thing I'm just graduating from college I didn't really perceive much of a problem with the school system however when you compare it to school systems like they have in japan and you can compare just about thing to japan and we look like we don't have anything it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough however if it weren't for our needless competition with japan I'd think that the school system works at a pretty good pace I don't know I haven't it's been seventy nine since I was at high school
and I've seen things change I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually because I wasn't really listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare you know what I mean?
but it seems like when I lived in chicago I've lived down here I hear the dropout rates from the schools and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year
and I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth
I've seen so many different things so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and I recognize that there are good schools out there somebody's getting a good education because we continue to employ people
but I don't understand why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities
I don't pretend to understand that either but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools but then again I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put because the dropout rate is in those areas it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime and they all seem to go together and it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle where you have the dropout rate and crime and general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better so the other two they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know it's a complicated issue I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school I don't know if I blame it on the school I think I blame it on a couple of different things I think I blame it on the school system
that's I meant when I said the school I don't blame it on the teachers in the school although I think that I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than they do quite well for themselves
that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district were well paid not all school districts are well paid but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid I know one family that's got they're both teachers and they both have second jobs that they work in the afternoons
they both work all summer full time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
it that family is making over a hundred grand and I'm I agree that teaching our kids is important
however these people who only work eight hours day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that and I don't even have kids
that's true but there's you can always play games with talking about look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong but when you're and there's really not much you can directly do about that I think that if there is a problem with the school system from it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well paid that perhaps that might be one area that could be improved you have other professional jobs and this is a profession and as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on are you in the middle of anything?
I'm not in the middle of anything I've just about the last thing I did about maybe close to a year ago now I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house so I guess that the whole thing?
that was fairly large undertaking it's a bedroom and a walk in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house did the framing and all?
we did it all except for the sheetrocking
that was the only thing we didn't putting the ceiling up and things like that we weren't sure how to do that and maybe you and I should get together because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
that's the exact opposite we put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have get those joints to go together
and whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that
we didn't know a thing about any of that and so my wife wishes I hadn't done that
it looked very hard to do so
we figured well just I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it to somebody who does it for a living but I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy
probably so and we'd never done it
so we just left it alone
but that's I guess I'm only twenty one so my vast experience of home owner's knowledge is not very much so it's just what I have to do more or less around the house for my parents so you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already enclosed? it was brand new brand new
we started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was and you knew how to do the framing?
my dad knew how to do most of it
we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it I don't know he did all the flooring himself he put the whole floor in and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we put not necessarily a garage but just a after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less it's not enclosed it's just somewhere to drive another car to park and it's do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?
it's off the ground on the piers?
it's on about twenty two inch piers something like that did you had those poured
or you did them yourself?
those are we did those ourselves so you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?
so it's the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of
those are I've done one I helped somebody do one of those before those are you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way but it's I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job
those are nice they're pretty forgiving you can always tear stuff out and redo it it's a
that's not near like building a house or anything but
those are nice especially when you get done you've got something I don't know I like them you just sit down on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue
I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and a backrest and all that stuff or I that sounds nice
all done by yourself I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
designed so we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts and then the rest of it I just did
a contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work but it was pretty it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that I just put on so
that's a good size deck
so that's it's not that expensive I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and no less than that
that's not cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together
that's good that's not bad at all didn't have to
the wood may it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is to get good lumber it costs I don't know about dallas but even in this little town it's not cheap at all I was surprised I'd be surprised if it wasn't cheaper where you are
it's probably more there it probably comes from where you are
it probably does most
I'm not sure but when I drive through that area that's all I see is pressure treated lumber yards
it's nothing but woods down here
I haven't I used to live in dallas in arlington actually
but that was just when I was a kid so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore but I don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any east texas
we have gas is a dollar twelve a gallon so that's probably about what you're paying
so my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard digging it out and laying sand and putting pavers on top of that so that's a lot easier you've got something going all the time
looks like we're ready to go capital punishment the problem I have with capital punishment is that it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but I don't think that it really actually does that I don't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are committed without any thought to the consequences and they don't stop and think and say maybe I shouldn't do this because I might get the gas chamber or something like that they worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it and how about you?
I think that in some cases it is warranted I do too
and I don't I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not you still have to do it I
I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer
or so you're in favor of capital punishment then for some things
I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood
needs to be punished or eliminated from society
you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again and then do it all over again
and I don't think that rehabilitation is effective have to agree with you and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because you still see them committing the same crimes but I tend to agree with you that we should have it I don't know that it's always effective but I guess we're kind of stuck with it it's a difficult problem to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime
but then I think that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment like for example you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and I don't think that would really warrant capital punishment
do you think they should be punished at all or go to prison because they're not really a danger to society it was almost really self defense in a case like that
it is to a certain extent
but I think I don't know because I know they put them in jail sometimes
I think in and it just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available
I wonder what you think about this and unfortunately we don't get to do it but it used to be a long time ago if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment so if somebody killed somebody in your family then if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to execute that person and I know that if somebody had done something to my family I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them but I don't think that's done much anywhere that's kind of drastic punishment
I think that would be kind of drastic punishment and might make you feel better but
but one thing I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated
but like I said if someone is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society
because they're a danger to everybody else that's interesting I have to agree with that
but there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that aren't really a danger to society and
and a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison
probably more of them then the other way around interesting I don't not sure I'm in washington d c or at least very close to it I'm not sure what kind of capital punishment we have here
I know in north carolina we do have capital punishment
and I'm from south carolina
I try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair
actually that is really a sore spot with me I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least u s automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal
and it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea but I
so do you have a car?
do you have a car? at that time actually I had a volkswagen rabbit
and it was a real lemon subsequently I got a buick century and it wasn't as bad
but last year I bought a honda accord and I take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it and it's wonderful
we used to have a honda accord and they're good they're really good cars every time I get taken to an auto repair place every time I go I get taken bad
woman goes in and they go we got a sucker let's see how much money we can get out of her
that's what happens every time
so what do you have?
I have a pontiac six thousand all the more reason to have a honda
but our honda just got old and just wore out it was eleven years old and it just out of it so so you bought a pontiac?
my ex husband's this just happened a couple of weeks ago he's my ex husband but just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car and everything is wrong with it the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks how old is the car? eighty seven
and he just doesn't take care of things but I was awarded the car so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic and I can trust him so he is trying to get things fixed on it
but it's just leak leak leak everywhere but I hate to go into a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not and charge me twice as much the last time I took it into a repair shop the man told me I needed a master cylinder so I said okay and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then about a month later a man was looking at my car and he asked me not a repair man but just a friend and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on and he looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder
and I didn't even know what one was and he showed it to me and it was old rusty just awful it was no more new than nothing so apparently it was the same one that was on there
more than likely probably filled the brake fluid up and that was it
that was it probably it was I was so irritated and that's happened to me more than once or twice just about every time I've went in somewhere so what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service
and you can hardly find one
the guy that's doing most of my car now goes to my church and that's the only reason I go to him because I know him
and I know he will tell me the truth because he doesn't even charge me for doing it so he's not going to take me
I just pay for the parts and he does it so that's wonderful you're lucky
I am so I don't know I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all we took our honda to the honda dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car
and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars they told us we just had to have one and we bought one we didn't no more need no new engine give me break
so it was not good and
how are you? you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget? I feel like I am from mars I'm fifty years old and I've been divorced for eighteen years but I've two kids and all but I've never had a budget and I don't do any planning and I don't know
I don't have a long term financial plan I don't try to control my expenses
but I'm glad you're a stranger
that sounds kind of like me but really I'm curious how other people live so maybe we should start with you what do you do?
about the same thing
maybe they're going to arrest us both
I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children and we live from hand to mouth we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we due for the next month
a couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it
the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
and when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area
and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money and we did that pretty successfully for about three months and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do the I had a part time job around fifteen years ago seventy six
and this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that and I actually did my bank account would I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but I had miscalculated I didn't keep a balance it's one of the problems I never had to in the past
I always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary even though I wasn't spending much money I sometimes would just things would get to tight and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time I spent money cash mostly I would write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning
but I would forget to write the things down and I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever
I even find now with the automatic tellers I'll go take money out of that
and then I forget to take that out of my checking account and
so I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
and I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make the I have to say that let's see at this point on I don't run out of money and it and I don't someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have and I think my strategy if I may is to not spend money I don't have expensive tastes I don't go out I buy a car the last car I got rid of I'd had it was nineteen years old
people were embarrassed for me it was a good car and
but it was still running it was great my mechanics loved it because it was a sixty five buick and it just wouldn't stop and it I just didn't feel the need for a new car it isn't like I couldn't afford one
and now I don't I tend to eat expensive food I don't mind buying a good steak but for me I only do that every week or maybe once a month
you buy a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous twelve dollars a pound you buy less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that
not very often but I'm just saying as a single person that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to
that's right so that's one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing a lot of why don't you start?
I don't know I refinished a couple of old dressers that were handed down it's nice tongue and groove construction I've been pretty successful with that things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that? what? are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing?
I've done some other things too I've done both
my wife has picked up a couple of things saying if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture and we've done it a couple of times I guess that we've been fairly successful with those
that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it
that's a good way to get started I have a really nice desk a nicer desk than I could afford which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital liberated it after a fire
and we stripped it all the way down and refinished it and it turned out to be a nice desk maple top or something of that sort
I put together a rolltop desk from scratch a kit I'm jealous
still had to cut it and everything but it was fun
I do things that might be too crude to be called woodworking I've built my own deck and things like that
I've done the same like the trim around the house the baseboards and things like that and I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too
I picked up a bunch of craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive
and so I do have a band saw and a router and things like that out in the garage but I can't say I use them very often
I'm looking at trying to get a router right now they come in handy at the most unusual times
putting doors in is the time when I'm I bought myself a template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
I'll bet but I've also used them for rabbeting because rabbeting on my radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
so I got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it and now I use it twice a year maybe
my brother's used it a lot for making drawers I don't know the big
what's your opinion of what a good router is like? I I guess it
because he was tell me the ones that you dial in aren't all that great they've plastic parts and stuff the ones that what?
that you dial in on the side I have never even looked at one closely the little use that I've gotten from my router I would spend my money on the bits
I have a medium quality craftsman router and the
how strong is it? it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than three eighths of an inch at a time but the problem is that as with any time you buy a tool as a package the bits that they give you are low end don't they
so a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars and if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it because I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself they won't last and I've never had the bits sharpened so that's a thing to consider is to
they really get hot don't they? and they dull after awhile especially I did some cabinets in ash and oak
and that wears a bit down we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen
and I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth and routing hardwood will take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so
I've cut some one by eight oak before was that fun that's
big solid pieces of oak are just tough and then you take the blade to get sharpened
that was with a circular saw
is this going to be fun? I've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening because treated wood will also chew them up treated wood can really make you sick too
actually I've been involved in electronics a long time in computers and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home up until maybe about a year and a half ago
I got one for my son a macintosh l c
it's a real easy to use color computer and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work
I'm currently in school so I've had an I b m clone for a couple of years now which I've been continually upgrading and I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it and I can't really I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer simulation or analysis so
it's very essential for me schools have them but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school it's much more convenient to have one at home where you going to school? at georgia tech I see so in engineering?
so that explains all the computer assignments
it do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work?
I have some games of course which I play on there and I have a program which allows me to access a weather data bank so I can check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby so it provides other means other than just strict computations and so on so do you have a computer for yourself at home? I just have one for my son and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing
at work I'm a technologist and I in the past have done a great deal of system development just through software development programming but now I find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communication system
do you use email and like that? emil probably pulls down a third of all my time
it's I have modem night computer so I can log into the network at georgia tech and access my account through there which can be useful but that and word processing is while I tend to obviously I do almost all of my report writing on my computer whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments
so it's really become my mainstay I guess I can't even remember actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer t r s eighty when they first came out
and I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high so I'm a old timer I did my master's thesis on a typewriter
I rented an I b m selectric
and it was a pretty big deal
it must have been tough it's a little bit strange for me I did my master's thesis last year and I did that on a computer and it seems like I just can't imagine how people did it before it must have been just so much work it was just a completely different world then
so you used your son's macintosh then? do you like that kind of computer? I like it I like it from a distance really I see the packages on it that are available and it's nice I really don't use it myself
when I come home from work I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things
so I let my son do it and of course there's an intellectual evolution taking place where
it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like v c r s and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy
if the interface is there so that it's fun to use and the challenge go ahead
have you every been tested for a new job or anything? I haven't but in my job I'm a nurse and we are allowed to be this is the rules that they can do this anytime I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested
so it's just sort of they can if they they can if they choose to
have you had any experience with it at all?
not really but I've always worked on a university level but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff so what do you think about that?
I don't think they're very accurate because I know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test and I know they changed afterwards I know of that too and I also know that things like antihistamines sudafeds things like that can really throw it off and you can not get a job because of it and they may not tell you the reason why
I had a friend it didn't cause her any problems with her job but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen
but what it was was she had been in the jungle and it was some malaria medication and she tested positive for that and so it really is a dangerous thing that way because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job and they weren't told why but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing or they would tell you or this person never use any drugs
I always I thought you got called back if you tested positive for more tests you should because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something I have real mixed feelings about it I don't know
do you know how wrong they are? is there a margin of error? the accuracy? I don't know I don't know but I know there are a lot of things that can influence them and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time
and if you could show that I interviewed for a job recently and I was taking entex and my doctor gave me a prescription for it
and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you and it didn't come up that I needed to do it but this could happen to anybody and if they would just say this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything so I don't know
and I'm not so sure they are that needed I'm not sure either
the only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check
if you're using it while at a job I can see a problem
but the occasional person then it's almost an infringement of your privacy it sort of is and this is it this I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways as a health professional I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs
so as a patient I feel we probably should be protected but on the other hand there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too so I guess you have to have trust some place along the way
you can't go around testing everybody for everything
so I don't know and I think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you I think that a company or a boss could use this they could keep on doing this to you or something I guess I can see where it could become a problem
and it seems like now they have tests I guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago
but maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago so
I know that's the other thing a lot of people as kids or young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever
there's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult but you can't say it was wrong at the time I think that's true
so that probably wouldn't be too good either
what kind of music you into?
I have a pretty wide taste in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to lot of different forms of music in fact it's easier for me to say the types of music that I don't like are opera and screaming heavy metal the opera it's right on track I like classical but I can't deal with opera at all
and heavy metal it's noisy I'm into some industrial music that's a bit even harder than that
it's got to have a point to it
I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to
but the basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you gets a little annoying what kind of progressive stuff?
lot of stuff that actually has ended up becoming popular like nirvana and I'm thirty so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the clash and the sex pistols and r e m that sort of stuff
r e m makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed it's a lot of people saying that bands in that position sold out
I think that's pretty much bull because r e m really hasn't changed if it's interesting
they're producing similar music and it's good music
but people have picked up on it that's good I think it is I'm impressed
for a while there popular music seemed to have not a lot of point to it I was really tired of the michael bolton
michael bolton really got on my nerves because he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes
and I could go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money but he picked the right songs and that's about all he had going for him or still has for that matter I guess
that and a marvelous hairdo
I'm sure that sold a lot for him that's all you really need for a lot of pop I've kind of developed a short hatred for pop
it just seems like there's no real point you hear the same tune over and over again in a thousand guises and
it's interesting because you were saying that you liked classical music
and I like a lot of classical music but I also dislike some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time
I can believe that what kind of things do you like in classical? what's the standard?
stuff that I like I like bach I tolerate vivaldi I can't stand debussy
I like tchaikovsky he can make a lot of noise when he's so inclined
and some stuff that I like for instance frank zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition and that's interesting music
but it would not get performed by any municipally funded philharmonic just because number one it's frank zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive
we're much better off playing beethoven's ninth
that's right we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and hum it it's safe
and it just isn't chance taking enough for me
I feel that music should take chances in one way or another and that if you've heard a piece a hundred times
I haven't had an awful lot of incidents regarding child care when my two year old was in new orleans she got bit on the cheek but that's about the extent of it
but when I really am concerned that so many of these child care places are coming under investigation for child molestation
and I'm saying to myself you dump your little turnip off to this child care place and they don't pay very much and why would they be interested in your little turnip unless one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is that's somebody to molest
and that's a terrible kind of thing and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it
I am a working mother I have three children and my children since they were very young I've had various different alternatives child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it I personally feel in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids are very secure well raised children my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities
so I it is a problem but as you pointed out I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford when our children were very young we had a live in paid baby sitter that was wonderful
and then as they got older they went to schools and they were really all day preschools and they were wonderful and I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things that's interesting
but we really truly did pay a fortune we were paying at one point about five hundred dollars a week for two children
you must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
I I'm a physician as is my husband
and I felt very good about working I'm a pediatrician actually
but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for I think not all of us you know the kind of things you're supposed to look for I'm an engineer and
I think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in and we had a really wonderful arrangement I'm with the university actually
and they had a wonderful program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work and so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing and they had wonderful they had things like gardens and lots of pets and they had a four to one teacher student ratio
so that sort of an most of the teachers had degrees five hundred dollars a week for two kids that's incredible
it was incredible actually
but it was good it at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition I paid a little bit extra but the kids were
they really had some great opportunities but
what you were alluding to earlier is women who work for minimal wage and really feel they have to put their children
sometimes they do put them in fairly low paying situations
they could somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and that's a good starting wage
but three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care
even that really I think I don't it's been awhile since I've looked at my youngest child is eight so it's been a little while since I've looked into actually daycare centers but they are
the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since we used to pay fifty cents an hour to baby sit but mine are twenty two twenty three and twenty seven so that
I guess baby sitters now are up at five dollars an hour? something like that
but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children it has been a real there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences and I think they have captured a certain market again the but then there are baby sitting groups as a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections
as you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around
I don't know what you drive now what do you drive now?
I have a ford pickup and the family car is a dodge caravan because we have three kids and they're under thirteen
so throw them in the back
they sort of fit our requirement I have one of those pickups with a seat in the back cab
and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work
right now I can throw them all in the back when we have room and since I do a lot of projects I throw things in the back there you go
and I kind of like having a pickup truck
actually I think of it as a car that'll last I know
I like the way trucks are built and I don't care about comfort so I'm pretty happy you're looking at I got a toyota four runner I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too so I got a four runner
so I wouldn't hesitate to get another one I never buy new so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck you're just like me I've never bought a new vehicle in my life
and I don't need to pay for the glitz I'll let somebody else have the showroom shine
and I'll pay for the rest of it let somebody else break it in
and the van we're we might go again on a van we could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time I'm not sure
we'll have to face it in a couple of years but I guess we had a small toyota wagon
and we were real happy with that because my second requirement after price is low maintenance
and it certainly had that we didn't do much to it at all
my pretty much the same like I say I got one of those toyota four runners
and it pretty much does everything I need it to it'll tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and it I can throw I've had eleven people in it before believe it or not
and it's real reliable I've had it for almost four years now and up until two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it
and then of course two weeks ago it decided I don't know it's the strangest weirdest thing in the world but it blew a head gasket
didn't do any damage to it I caught it real early
how at how many miles?
ninety seven thousand
so it's not real early
you didn't overheat it? never overheated it I smelled the coolant
went out and looked saw where it was coming from drove it right to the shop and left it off
that was and that was it because I have that and then I have a kawasaki motorcycle which is actually usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining
that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle
it's a I don't know people who buy motorcycles for transportation are kidding themselves
I have one colleague that commutes to work on one when it's not raining and he's a it's he's pretty conservative guy I don't think it's much of a sport for him I guess I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it I'm sure he does so
when was the last time you took your truck out just to go driving?
and I go out twice a week on the bike at least just for the enjoyment
but the only thing I think I might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but another car I would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one I've got just because there's a lot of times I wished I had just an open bed to throw stuff in
I'm sure that that's very you got one that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and
if I only had some place that I could store the camper top I would have it off most of the time
I really leave it on there just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty to have it out of the way
but they're solid trucks are built I think they last a lot longer than anything else
they're the only things americans still know how to build and the trucks do even though the little jap trucks are good there too but so are the though I think the chevies I don't think the I don't like the chevies as much as I like the fords
I think the fords tend to last a little longer at least until recently I kind of like mine
so mine's a ford a friend of mine just bought a year ago it's a really nice truck I don't like dodges at all but one of the dodges they have out now has the cummins turbo diesel on it
I heard about that it's beautiful
that thing will last forever
that's a serious truck that thing's it's got a boat engine in it
this I know a contractor who just got one of those he's pleased with it
I actually in this modern day and age it seems like we have more and more leisure time because we have so many appliances and whatnot we don't even have to cook dinner anymore
but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together
the kids maybe on the average get something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
that's what I've heard too it seems bizarre to me I don't quite understand it although I think probably the worst thing that's happening in at least the modern world today is television
not so much because it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming and there's also some poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time
it's so darned easy to turn the thing on
I know it I tell myself sometimes just sit down after work so I refuse to have one in the house
good for you good for you I talk to a lot of people about that and I've thought about it myself and I though about it a lot
but I still haven't done it yet that's good I'll tell you television sure makes child rearing easy on you the kids can be a real pest and turning the t v on is almost like magic it's like sticking an electrode into their pleasure center and you don't have to worry about them that's true I've noticed that but I don't think it's too good
I don't think so either so I don't know I take advantage I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but I take advantage of dinner time we always eat together and whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them
do you keep your kids active in sports or anything or I guess our big outlet is music
our thirteen year old son plays violin and our nine year old daughter plays cello
and when our son started playing violin I took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello
so there's plenty of interactive time in practicing although neither kid likes to practice I guess that's not a big surprise
not for kids but I imagine with infants most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them although
I try and read to them
and I take them to the park and stuff and reading is so good
I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
they get to that stage but I read there's this doctor seuss sleep book have you ever seen that yet?
sleep book it's called a sleep book and you ought to get it I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized
we've got quite a few of doctor seuss books I think his sleep book is my favorite
I like to do it and they enjoy reading I never read a lot growing up and I never read until a few years ago I just started picking up books and so I've found that it's really important to me to get to read I like to get away in a book?
and so I've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day?
I probably spend an hour or two that's great
my wife works at night so she does tupperware so she's gone a lot at nights and so I spend a lot of time with them I see how old are your kids again? they're two and one two and one
so you have your hands full with them that's for sure
do you think that there's any way that or do you think there's too much crime now? I guess any crime is too much but it's out of control
out of control I don't know I guess it could be worse we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood I live in the university district in seattle near the university of washington there's a lot of problems there's a big rise in homelessness and more street people and we get cars on our block regularly gone through rifled through and stuff
I would not have guessed that in seattle
you figured it was like omaha? you know
it's not newark but it's got problems I wonder what really is the answer it seems like the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system
I think most people regard it as a warehouse where you put away the people that are so bad that you don't want them out in circulation
but the problem is that we only have but so much room and we try to put aside in the warehouse and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes and
that's what I hear so it's
I think don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea? I get the feeling that a lot of people have I'm not convinced that I have
my mom taught english as a second language and she was dealing mostly with people that were in on drug crimes and
you mean she taught in a prison?
in a maximum security prison down in central virginia I see
and the problem she had was not with the inmates at all the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison it was
the bureaucracy they put her obviously I didn't see the classroom and hopefully never will but they put her at the end of a hallway
there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body alarm which
and I don't know exactly what that is but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and really annoy a lot of people but
so she didn't feel safe she didn't she didn't she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates and then later on the administration kept getting worse and she got a couple of inmates that she didn't feel quite as comfortable around
but when we came back to the states she decided that it was too she didn't feel that public schools were safe so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison but
at least it's maximum security but the point was that it you said that perhaps people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible and I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people that run the system have given up on it
I think the people that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical
I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff and it's you can get pretty hardened I'm sure but getting I always have problems because I can never decide whether or not I'm supposed to be a conservative or a liberal but
but I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that a lot of this is circumstances
those are funny labels I can't help but wonder if I grew up without a father on the streets and with little or no money wouldn't I be in prison at this point?
I think you can blame it on social problems I don't know
as poverty has gotten worse as education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's been more crime we've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program
there's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse
and it's a mess I don't remember the gentleman's name but the mayor of baltimore is a rhodes scholar and what he
is he the guy wants to deregulate heroin or something? what he wants to do is take all the money that he gets for drug enforcement and use it for drug education
and basically just attack the problem at the demand side
stop trying to attack supply which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't switzerland tried the grand experiment and they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park and
when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times the benefits are good and the pay is regular but sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know what's going on and maybe that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do what's your feeling about benefits? what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company
since I'm kind of on the older side I just feel like when I start talking about benefits I'm concerned about medical benefits my husband works for mcdonald douglas and so his medical benefits are so excellent that's really great
I work for a bank western financial
and they don't let me know really about anything that's going on even some of the immediate things that I need to know I don't know it until the next hour and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made we're changing departments we're changing policies we're changing doing other kinds of things which to me is disturbing I feel like if I don't necessarily need to be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level you are right there I'm pretty much on a low level as far as the company is concerned but I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if I had a little bit more information along that line I work for the government
and actually I work for the f b I
and so there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason but basically there's lots of things that we should know about projects I'm an engineer
I'm a cotr and and I worked in the same lab with a guy and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years and we should have we're now collaborating and
and it for two years we didn't which was kind of stupid but our organization is doing something else on monday for all unclassified programs we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways and all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which I thought was kind of interesting but that sort of thing that is interesting
but I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
but of course most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know and if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that but regard to benefits most big organizations have decent benefits like retirement and that sort of thing in the private sector I would think that one of the major situations especially when you reach the mid fifties is keeping a job until you retire
and engineers are baggage as they get older to most companies and it's very much like the military it windows out you think I'm getting more money and I'm getting more responsibility I'm doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
and pretty soon somebody falls off I've fallen off twice in the private sector and I can get up
I know it seems to be kind of scary because you think of my son's eighteen right now and he wants to go into engineering and the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open and he's interested in basically three different areas but it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that he needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years
and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical my brother in law he's sixty he's not ready to retire but his company is closing up
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on he's getting cut back and he's not ready to retire he may be retired
generally I get most of my news in the weekly magazines like time newsweek and u s news and world report with occasional smatterings of the wall street journal and of course the local paper
but my only complaint is I really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper exhaust the details so that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article
and so I like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of what's going on
but many times the local news kind of suffers but here I am cheek by jowl with our nation's capital and
that's right you're very close actually it's almost a bedroom community for the capital
when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself guys I'm inside the beltway
but it turns out that the c n n is great and for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
but generally they're more sound bitish kind of thing and I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient dose of news that way
a lot of my information comes from several sources probably pretty high up on the list is national public radio which I like
I think it's fairly objective and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative and while there's an inherent filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of favoring the other side that's potential indication of balance and generally I really do believe they are pretty balanced I also read time magazine and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the articles and the front section and the mercury and the chronicle are the only things that are really can stand up there
you did you use to live around here? redwood city I use to work at anteks
I know exactly where that is anteks amdahl and places like that
we get the mercury which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper
the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times the los angeles times which I've found to be a very good quality newspaper
and I like a lot of the articles there the other thing when you said we don't have cable t v but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is called c span I enjoy we have both c spans here but really on the public t v macneil lehrer is an hour's program that I always both?
if I watch any news program it will be macneil lehrer and occasionally c span
I saw the tapes that were run of marion berry's drug bust the whole thing was run on that and also they have the parliament's question and answer period
I never say that that would have been interesting it
I think that's always fascinating I wish we had something when it first tuned in on that I it's one that's I think it was somebody was just ripping the hell out of another person
and I and everybody was making noise in the background and then
but it's usually the prime minister? here's this dude in a wig thatcher major and I said to myself it's another monty python that I didn't know about
and then up jumps margaret thatcher off her green bench and I said it's parliament
which could be another of monty python so I thought to myself I can't wait I'm going over to britain in mid may I'm going to approach my this is how I discovered the prime minister's question and answer period
I have seen that and aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in american politics which I really enjoy I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions I think and it's unlike the fairly controlled press conferences that presidents of the united states have here where they always seem
I guess it starts recording now
I don't really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in we live in the saginaw area
saginaw? and I'm not real familiar with anything that I fact as far as I know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here or the grocery store or anything in this area
the we live in plano and they started off recycling by putting the I think at each wal mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now I guess the city has bought the big green trash cans and they have a recycling truck that comes around now and you separate your glass and paper and aluminum
and you set it out and they pick it up and it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response
that is pretty good we're originally from another state and I know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing the city set separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it
on bottles did they give you so many cents back for cans I don't really know
even or I don't really know they started after we moved down here and so I'm not really familiar
I just know that my in laws up in oklahoma that's how they pick it up but I don't know if they get anything back on it or do you get money for it?
I noticed it iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can
so you don't see too many thrown out around the streets or even bottles
all kinds of bottles they really charge people when you purchase them and then when you turn them back in
I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel and now most of them are throwaway
so maybe that's one thing they can do I think now they're a lot more expensive than that I bought some cokes the other day in the little bottles
and I know they were at least ten cents apiece I started to see at home I was how much were those bottles?
and they come in eight and ten packs instead of six packs
and it was two dollars and something for the bottles I was god almighty it costs more for the bottles than it did for the cokes that was my brother's first job in a grocery store he was in the bottle area in the
it's pretty dangerous out there when they fall over but it's quite
they say that there's a big glut of the green glass of green glass
it's amazing out in this area they really don't have anything I know that minyard's and places like that around arlington and fort worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have four different bins out front different colors for different things and things like that
but I do know some of these places were doing that and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them
it's I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs
it's people just they really don't there's too much labor involved to separate the stuff more than it's worth
it's I don't know it can be it's not as easy selecting clean junk as they say
who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
that's right that's right it's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher we all do it
it was nice talking to you it was nice talking to you I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything
I think two or three minutes is fine is that it?
it was nice talking to you and I guess actually I was going to do it for my son so that he could make some money
but then it has my name on it so I'm okay I'll sit down here and call it
we're doing it for a church choir so are you? that's interesting that's nice thank you thank you
what is your community currently doing with regard to recycling?
basically they're just having various recycling bins located for trash pickup that's more than we have up here in massachusetts some local communities are very active in that respect and they do have bins set up but I live in a metropolitan area and they're not too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
here they live in an apartment complex
and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins I think a lot of the issues with regard to recycling are that people have to be motivated to do something like that because it does take extra effort whether and I know massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the store and not that's the majority of people that I know of anyways where people aren't really eco conscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do and I'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away that type of thing
here they're trying to push through a bill but people need to be more conscious of it
and a lot of people are against it and it's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans and matter of fact I think it took three tries for it to go through and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as highways being people would have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they keep the bottle so it's been a ecologically sound policy as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into manufacturing and that's the big thing that they try to promote
I think here instead of just requiring that you put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate that's a good idea
there definitely has to be a motivation factor and I know that where I work I work for a defense contractor and there's a big push on for recycling paper materials computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of styrofoam usage because of the process involved in styrofoam and the whole eco issue and that and they're very proactive and matter of fact they give you discounts if you use china wear rather than styrofoam stuff so it's incentives like that that get people more conscious of it I think that's what they need to do be more proactive like that
I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books usually have them come from projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual trash they just matter of fact that reminded me of an article I saw in the the local schools you could send your phone book with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time a guy went to a landfill dug down five feet and pulled up a phone book from nineteen sixty because they don't degrade over such a period of time
part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper
they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
now I think they've come up with some way of pulling the glue out
randall do you have any special interest in space flight?
ever since I was a young and used to watch the old apollo missions going off in classroom t v s
I suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those go off very exciting
the I've always wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that and to meet and to see it actually happen
of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
but that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately what do you do now? computer programmer
unfortunately that can be done from the ground to bad
made the wrong career choice to get up into space
the I used to think when I was younger that by this time we'd have lots more stuff in space than we do now
frustrating at times
I don't know what you think about all that I'm kind of young I'm only twenty two and so I'm not there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as with the space shuttle and all although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties
although I have a I kind of wonder if it were possible to market some form of space technology to make it equitable it might severely help the economy in the respect that there's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and whatnot
it would be great if we could find some way to use that to boost the economy
the I've always felt that one of the long term solutions would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up
because that's a singularly renewable resource that doesn't require any particularly nasty environment impact
and you can just get as much power as you need up there
it's just a matter of how big you build it
and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing so the side effects of doing that which I think would be good very very good for everyone in the long run is some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also so I'm it seems like there's so you're talking about positive side effects then I understand
that makes a lot of sense
the only problem is of course that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
and they want to do the research and they're all
the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to mars which would produce some useful scientific research and so forth
but the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth
it would be being done for the glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of for
we should eventually send people to mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
we should do it for the return we get for it
and unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened least not
I would settle for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the but
the downside of that is after you do one of those people say we did it
now we're done now we're done
no need to play around with this space stuff anymore that's what happened with apollo but I'd give almost anything to get into space I think you're right
I would too I'd was it john denver that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle? what sort of company do you work for? do you work for a big or a little place?
I work for georgia tech sir I work for the research facility and it's kind of small in a sense but it does have about two thousand civil employees
and on a scale I guess it's still considered small it just have a lot of different laboratories
the area I work in it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so
so that's make up most of the laboratory so from that standpoint it's pretty small
what about yourself? I work for actually probably similar kind of place I work for lincoln laboratory
we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech
I see and so we're actually part of m I t so it's very much the same kind of place the technical institution
while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what things were important besides salary and a job list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the challenge of the work and the working conditions things like that
I don't know what sorts of things would you consider important?
those and probably the security aspect of it
because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working you're treated and it may not be true in every place in a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a person
because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and their well being as far as how their next dollar going to come in how they going to pay their bills they just lay them off
and I was reading this book one time about this guy that had I think the company still exists what they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off
that way that one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time
and I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better other than something like unemployment is good but the company as a whole because you as an employee even the company is making money they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth you're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than neglect or something like that
because it's not a person's fault that people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time I don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but a number of people can be the downfall of a company situation how do you mean that? I know it
in a sense that how do you make a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people for the bad times of the company
what about the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well
in that standpoint you think it's better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company or I do
I really do I think it'd be better that way and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that there are problems
and there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time
that's my views I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that I think back about a few years ago when things were tough hewlett packard did that for awhile they went to a four and a half day work week rather than just cut everybody back ten percent and have to give everybody a half day a week off
and I think you can do that for a little while but I'm
at least that would give a person a chance to look because the way it is a person really don't have a chance go ahead
the subject is child care and how to determine child care and that's an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children but I did run a child care facility for a while
and have some you should have some opinions on that then
I do have some thoughts on that it's an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent or parent for a lot of people there and it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities I guess if I were going to choose my first consideration would be safety
my second consideration would be health
and I guess my third consideration would be warm personal environment
in texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate at an institutional level and at a small home level so you meet the standards but then after that there's a lot more I think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people in terms of not just because somebody has a child or likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that absolutely
as a matter of fact I believe that the safety and health issues depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children
and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the right people the qualified people and it's the most difficult of all for a parent judge because a person can be very nice and warm and loving
but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are
and the other thing that's difficult in a too small setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't want to just warehouse the child and I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important and you have to have the right kind of enrichment and that includes an atmosphere in which the child is safe and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for but also his developmental needs are cared for too maybe the right thing to do is to when a couple has a child then they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting that would be lovely get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six
and then of course to make up for that the parents would have to work in their later years longer in other words they probably may end up not working at all in the twenties
that's an interesting thought because but then they have to work from age thirty or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety that would be okay
that would help on the other end too in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be the world is changing from industrial base to information base and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work
that's exactly right all you have to do is have a sharp mind and I believe that mental acuity is easy to maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind
so I think a person could work into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter if they didn't have to do a lot of physical labor they could maintain what do you think about capital punishment?
I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes which crimes do you feel that?
I think first degree murder probably warrants it because of so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent selling should also
recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever
I originally come from the state that has the death penalty I come from florida
and they're pretty liberal on it they tend to fry people left and right which that's
go ahead go ahead texas is too texas has had forty six in the past several years
so they're pretty hip on it too I guess they do it by lethal injection at huntsville
I think florida still uses electric chair
I don't know in some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing god
and that's not I don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it
I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not
with florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year they that's what's happening here there is that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the turnover rates of repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
and it's like that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
and it gets to be a big problem
go ahead I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't
be a little more not being able to put it off for fifteen years
because a lot of these guys they get in and they get off for good behavior and I don't know up in minnesota where I am now they don't have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system because they figure I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something but then for if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten
just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head I don't know I think that may solve a lot of that
maybe not solve it but I don't know maybe I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient
kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty
what do you do georgeanne? I'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas
what program you in? audiology what do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the university of central florida
I'm doing an internship up at honeywell
but I don't know it's an interesting issue like you say in texas there's been quite a few and in florida in the last few years I think there's been a lot I can't give you figures but I just this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in california
so I think it the forty sixth in the last twenty five years is what
is that right? they gave a run down that texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
I've heard things about that I've heard that they don't mess around very much
they don't get repealed as easily as they do
the guy in california got twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said you don't have to go and then they took him back it just seemed a little inconsistent
that's a lot of repeals and then you have two you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever
I don't know I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it I guess what's the policy now with treason? do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? I don't think the military doesn't execute anymore so
or death before the firing squad or whatever
so I think about the only one is rape what's your
are you into the cowboys?
I'm not I haven't been I grew up in dallas but I'm still not a cowboys man I like philadelphia eagles that's all right that's my favorite team so
now that randall's coming back next season I hope they'll do a little bit better they didn't do too bad last season
but I hope they can do better how about yourself? I don't know I kind of go back and forth depending on who's really hot and who's not I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects
but I guess if I have my druthers I'd probably go for the seattle seahawks I kind of like them
that's another one of my favorites they're kind of
they're not my favorite totally but I do like them I like
seahawks are good they now that steve largent is gone I kind of lose a little bit for them but he
to be honest with you I probably watch college a little bit more than I do pro
I kind of like college actually quite a bit
that's kind of strange it's too much running for me in college football I like the pros is it?
they do it's more high tech more players are apt to act a little bit different when it's a job and not just that could be
when you're getting paid millions to do it I think they take it to another level
but I can see it's more grunted out run the ball type college football is a little bit different but you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then who's that?
notre dame? I root for nebraska quite a bit
nebraska there's a running team
that's boring for me I'll take the passing teams any day
but I can see definitely how you get into that to be honest with you I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well and
it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle
it gets kind of monotonous after awhile I prefer a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just to juice it up a little bit
but I think they're starting to realize that a lot of the big eight teams that used to run so much I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore
it's high dollar it's all money now even college is all can we get on t v so
that's so what's this world league is coming in? that's getting ready to start up?
have you followed that very much or
not really I don't think anything will ever take over the n f l I think it's an institution
it's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball I just
it can take over part of it but it's never going to be the next it can take over a small market share but nothing really
it's going to take a little bit some people are going to watch it but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every sunday afternoon or anything
it's never going to reach that standard but I think I agree with you it's kind of interesting to see their claim of world football but when in reality it's really americans playing somewhere else
it's kind of strange I guess we're the only ones who take it that far
everybody else still nuts over soccer but actually I kind of like soccer I've never really played it
but I like the idea it's an interesting game to watch that and rugby I like to watch rugby every now and then
or australian rules football that's whatever you want to call it there
that's some brutal stuff there that's worse than football as far as violence I think those guys kill each other out there rugby is something else there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere
that's just wild that's why it's a big college thing
rugby is definitely big in college because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
so I could see the feel for that but it's fun to play I'll give it that it is fun to play if you don't value your very much you've played it then?
but I don't think rugby will ever be professional but it's I doubt it not in this country anyway
you can't stay healthy and do that that's a rough game it is
but I don't know I don't know how my eagles are going to do this year so you
the seahawks are an up and down kind of team they really are
it's kind of odd my roommate that I live with here he's lived in pennock minnesota do you know where that is? I don't to tell you the truth I'm
it's a small town it's about two hours it's in central minnesota it's a couple of hours west of minneapolis
but to tell you the truth I'm not even really from here
you just live there now I'm up here for a year on an internship
he's but I actually live in florida live in florida
like the seahawks who the heck is going to root for tampa bay?
I've only been to philadelphia twice and I still like
I guess I could go for miami but I don't know
but I'm from I root for nebraska so I don't have a real love for miami anyway
but I don't know I guess I get into pretty much
I'm here how do you feel about public schools?
our public schools are really poor I feel
I'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation but we're toward the bottom
and there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong that you would think it would be easy to correct
but the system doesn't allow for the corrections
how about you? that's interesting I have a sister who used to live in kennesaw georgia
and she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there and she complained quite a bit about their school system there and
and cobb county is better than the county I'm in
she was in cobb county I'm I can't really say much about the schools up here I really don't come from here
I'm only up here temporarily on an internship but I live in orlando florida usually
and the schools down there are not bad they're pretty good
that's great but I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
for example I have a brother in north carolina and he says the schools there are just terrible
I feel that we're way behind I have a son that is in the fourth grade
and they have just now taken up division and that is slow
my husband and I go to the store and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things and I feel like there are several areas that we're just really really slow in
and I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system it is what do you think's wrong to cause that?
for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they do not use it wisely
my son's teacher has twenty seven students
and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis
but more than that I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office it can really be bad
that's one thing I worry about
also I think we have a lot of hispanics there you go
and we have a lot of the county I'm in the minorities are mostly hispanic probably quite a few black people up there and
we're from the county they marched in we're in forsyth county is that right?
and we and there's very very few blacks
so that's I hate to say it's not a problem because I hate to feel like they are a problem although they are but it's you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever but then again
but it is a problem especially in the inner city there is no denying that
you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
and you can't put all the children in special education that's right you can't do that
and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done
I grew up in nebraska
and the school that I went to there was fantastic it I really consider myself very very lucky we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty seven thirty kids to a class but
but your teacher had control we zipped right along I was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily I believe I was too
but you're right with all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline I think
it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school
we just can not afford it I was going to ask you if that was an option if
here in logan utah we've got a nice little valley here and it's crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley here in seattle the air's getting more and more polluted we're in kind of a basin and seattle is on puget sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains and there's been a lot of population growth around here and it's getting worse I think most of it is from cars
here in utah up along the wasatch along the western side of these rocky mountains here where a lot of the big cities are salt lake and ogden and provo and logan's up in the valley a little bit further north we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars
and it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion and when we get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the wasatch front which match that of l a a few years ago
it's almost sad because when I grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys I live in the university district
and it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution I think probably due to a lot of students going back and forth to school
and then we're right next to interstate five also
they're getting serious about things like mandatory they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions have they started doing that yet?
they've actually started doing it down along the not in logan up here cause we're doing a lot better population is a lot lighter up here we have that here and they're expanding it to more counties here as the population spreads out and I think they're also going to be making it mandatory for more cars there was something in the law about if your car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore and I think they're eliminating that loophole
they're eliminating that out here
they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun where they're looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust kind of like a radar gun and you mean they could do that remotely?
do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually
and where does the source light go?
across the street they'll set up a trap or something like that in some sense I see
and they're also looking at other ways of monitoring this cause they've found out something basically that and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was four hundred times as much of certain pollutants then a properly tuned car
and the idea being that if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing fifty percent of the pollution then it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half that's neat
but it's also been everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but it's tough I've looked into riding the bus to work and I can drive to work and get there in twenty to twenty five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over lake washington on one of the floating bridges
but if I take the bus it requires several transfers and it takes over an hour
so it's not hard to see why I keep driving
and they're and I feel guilty cause I'm driving a
do you all have a budget? we do we've been married for twenty three years
and we have three teenage daughters and they're very expensive so we have somewhat of a system it's kind of hard to explain
we've actually gone just recently to having two checking accounts we always had just one
and now we are having two it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal
it's so I have to be that's kind of the way I feel about it
I usually my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course we're like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month
and do you have a two income family or one income?
we have a two income family she also works
but she enjoys it and she's good at it if it's I'm pretty bad about procrastinating
and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe
you know how that goes but if she handles it pretty well she writes all the checks once a month your wife
it that what is her career related to finance or accounting?
sort of on a peripheral she's an annuity administrator
and so she works for an insurance company
but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff and so that's sort of related to her field a little bit sort of
and we've experimented with budgets from time to time but if you have to keep up with them so a lot of times we just kind of play it by ear we try to keep our retirement and our savings kind of automated
so we never see that money just taken directly it's just taking it out
we do the same thing
and that's kind of handy because if you don't see it you don't miss it if you don't spend it you have something to take it out that's exactly what we've always done
they've always had where they match your funds sometimes if you save so much then they will match it
we've done that too but my husband works for an insurance company
and he has now for about ten years but he was with another company before that but we have I work also but I only have a part time job
and I get paid very little but I try to use that money for food jim gives me a certain amount money we just transfer it into my account
and then I use that for food household expenses and then I add my own check to that and then with that I try and handle some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that
but the expenses that we need and have around the house
it sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do
just kind of play it by ear but keep the deductions we
jim has a budget I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down
I am given so much money a month so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that
so I try not to I don't ask for more I just try and make it on that
because I think when you go to the grocery store you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
and you can really waste a lot of money that way
how long have you been married?
about five years so you're just really getting started so do you have a family too?
I've got one little girl she's nineteen months
she's not she hasn't effected your budget yet really
not really not too bad not like she will later on
you will see that all of a sudden you're trying to decide whether you are going to do soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do when
and then you really have to start saying now what can we afford
what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more but I think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
and then as the girls got older I think we did more and more of that more budgeting as they got older
but what do you do? do you
I'm an electronic technician
I work for a university georgia tech research and
so I just we have a good friend that's about to move to atlanta I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things I'd better get back to the subject
but budgeting I found I feel a lot better we use to work out of one check book
and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month
now I know exactly what I'm spending and it's so much easier one way or another we're now recording home repair
you were helping your parents I still am really they're sort of remodeling a house out in downtown atlanta in candler park
and we've done lots to it we've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them and you're remodeling? how about you?
I live in an apartment now two summers ago I went to massachusetts
and I went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house
and this was a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say
and we started from an empty lot with trees and stuff on it
and we had to cut them down and clear the lot we had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement pour the basement and went from the ground up
one of our main problems was
in massachusetts I thought I was going to it was a fun time but I thought summer time
all it ever did was rain and thunder storms
and one thing is that we were going to pour the basement foundation
and we're in the process and it started pouring down rain
and I guess we had most of it done but the end was result what happened was that a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and not a very good finish
but it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay
but it kept us pretty busy it was only there was me and my friend and then we just had two helpers and sort of a family type
it wasn't a commercial project or something it was sort of just get my brother and maybe my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing so that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes
and then materials coming in
and so we're hopping around pretty good but overall we got it done and it's a three bedroom two bath house and it's pretty neat nice
nice what was it for? you just
it was for my friend's parents they had some property there and they'd lived in this old
it's sort of like a farm you might say and they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something
and his mom just wanted a new house
that has been her dream and so we did that and she was really pleased with it so it came really great that's great
why is it that the weather in atlanta that gets very hot
where you live it gets very hot? it does
and that's why you and the windows what type of windows are you putting in?
because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in the solar game?
have you what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it
but it in a lot of the windows?
the house is eighty years old and it's had several owners and stuff and they have put plastic plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows
these so you have the sash windows in?
did it go up and down?
I see and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there
there's a problem with those those are they usually most of the time don't open very well ours didn't
and the ones that would open wouldn't want to stay open they wanted to slam shut
and they a lot of vibration and it causes the glass to crack and it's a never ending problem
I haven't been in any really home repair things lately I
regarding taxes I taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society but really people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself
and so as a result it's a trade off for the common good for the benefit of others how much of your resource should you dedicate to making things work for others? have you ever thought just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it?
I know it's a lot that I feel just like you said that there's just so much that you can do yourself that you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either but yet they accept it the thing of it is if I wanted to just permanently become a book reader I guess I could just go on public assistance look for people to take care of me like so many people do
and probably a good woman
just con somebody to take care of me and then you don't have to be on the tax roll
but taxes are very difficult kind of thing and everybody really hates it it was very timely I always over pay my deductions so I wind up getting money back from my withholding
that's always a smile but of course I've paid it in and I should calculate it better
you are you in business for yourself?
I work for the f b I
so I'm a federal employee
guess I don't sound like it?
I I think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else unless you work for internal revenue I belong
I've got all four feet in the trough being a federal employee
but I can understand who gets benefits every time there is a bond issue I vote no on every one of them
I but this is not tax revolt country there's too many most of us have all four feet in the trough plus our snout right up to our ears
so it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a tax revolt situation
but the local taxes here in this particular area I think I pay about thirty five hundred for taxes on my four bedroom house which is a lot of money
and so as people get older and older they think about retirement and that sort of thing
and they're building old people's homes at tax expense I think the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper at thirty three hundred dollars or thirty five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes I could go down to bulverde and probably rent a house for that?
that's right instead it's the taxes here so
course I don't know whether I want to go to bulverde or not or seguin or someplace like that
but there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer if you're not going to use them then you want to be in environment that's a strategy that the people have to take is how to be able to lessen their cost of living I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire and I'm saying I really can't stay here as a retiree
after you retire it's too expensive
I'm going to have go out in east fork someplace and do my thing
my parents are in the same situation their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes and they have no children in school or anything now they don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards they redecorated in nineteen seventy five
and they're not doing it again
so it's certainly you must be a t I employee you must be what? you must be a t I employee?
I'm not you're not a t I who do you work for?
I don't work I'm a student I go to school I'm in nursing school you're
the question was talking about the juries and one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having especially for repeat offenders that maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again so that a judge would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day
I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed
I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case
so a judge should have the whole dossier of the criminal there
and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing I agree with you one thing I heard was this where instead of going to the regular court they have a mock court it's supposed to be all legal and everything you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and you're done with it it's almost like the night court we see on t v
but it's not that we have such it didn't backlog all of the cases that are all ready pending so I that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way in other words not
there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial?
I don't there's a point on which we don't agree
I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime one of the parties wants one
and usually it is the defendant that wants to have the jury hear the case
so I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we take that
that would require a change in the bill of rights I believe and so and I didn't mean that
I didn't mean that because if I didn't have that right not to have a jury that I would feel that my civil rights had been violated but I meant for some when both parties agreed that we're going to have a judge here we're not going to have a jury let's get it over with sort of car accidents
I think that's all ready possible
I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial
so I agree that that should be encouraged
people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to clients unless they feel they can tweak a jury into giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the award giving a different sentence the take
and I suspect it in cases like I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil is that right? we're at liberty to talk and meander as long as it's all on the same theme
in the case of civil things maybe the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage and I think that may be where jury use is overdone
there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently
but the lawyers are really it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible
so I was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in a criminal cases
I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that but I am in favor of it for criminal cases so there's a difference of my view there for those two you can tell I haven't been in too many judges chambers or anything like that
have you ever had to serve jury duty? I was called once when I was nineteen
but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me and I was doing school and things like they let me out
I've never had to it since and that was almost twenty years ago
it isn't sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in
that would have been about twenty years too
just last year and the case I heard was a criminal case and it seemed really trivial
it involved two bicycles
we didn't do the sentencing the judge did how interesting
we rendered a verdict and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing
and that was here in wisconsin so I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it type of music is hot down in texas?
I don't know exactly what's hot down in texas I know what's hot down here with me so that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know I don't ever listen to the radio and that's usually what's hot around here what kind of music do you like? mostly folk music
folk music I find myself listening to a lot of either old timer or new england dance bands as well as just more popular folk music and new artists coming up
we're on totally different wavelengths
I'm more old rock and roll some newer heavy metal rock and roll type van halen that kind of thing
what about classic rock type stations
I don't listen to the radio at all we live in a fairly small town so classic rock for me is what I have which is doors eagles jimmy hendrix
some of the older eagles stuff was good
I didn't like they started getting a little more the type of music at least to me only sounds good at a high volumes and I don't like listening at high volumes
but some of their older stuff was quite enjoyable to me
they hotel california and that era
that's something doesn't even sound good loud really
definitely anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some I might know of I don't know any folk music at all down in texas listen to a little country every now and then
here I'm sure there's a lot of that down there
plenty way more than I can stand down here
I don't care for it at all that texas twang or whatever you want to call it I there's a conway twitty twang then there's the dolly parton hollywood sound
that's even more commercialized country music
but it's getting pretty big everywhere as I see it garth brooks is outselling guns and roses I think some of them the artists are even hitting the pop charts
it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is concert tours for country and western sings it's quite odd but I don't know music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays I think it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music I think most artists are in to make a few bucks
and that's all it but they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were
late sixties early seventies they were definitely pushing a message that's what it
that's what you say and then music is wrapped around now now it's the other way around I don't think gun at least to my mind guns and roses doesn't have too much to say
they don't have anything really important you want to hear but it's kind of odd it's like it doesn't have to be good it's just who does it
you hear a paula abdul song and you and I think if somebody else were to play that everybody would think that's lousy but because she did it it's supposed to be good it comes to the point where it's your name not what you do more than anything
madonna can do anything and it would be considered good because it's madonna
madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just because madonna does it so it's really backwards how things are working now
but it's the artist not the merit
I don't think that's a good thing at all but that's the point we've reached so I don't know how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least
I don't know I know for myself that for the most part I don't know which artist is which so I listen to a song I either like the song or I don't like it
and then if I really like the song eventually I'll figure out who it was
that's about how I am on popular music I don't know enough about it because I just listen everything I listen to is what I buy not whatever they play on the radio so you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist?
I I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time I don't really switch around to new things very often
it's way to hectic and too confusing so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop?
generally or about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard
and I listen to it that way but as far as I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it that's one thing I like about some of the folk music scenes there's a couple of nice small coffee houses up in new jersey
and it's very nice you go into the coffee house and an artist is there and very often the artist will have an album and so if you like the artist you buy the album
so you definitely get to try before you buy
that's definitely I it you don't always quite get it right
budgeting activity in our household is kind of an informal kind of situation we put actually what happens is my check gets automatically deposited I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore it just gets deposited and my wife looks at all those bills that come in
and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them and so our budgeting we really don't have a formal budgeting situation every time I've ever tried one I've just got wrapped in my inertia and I've just decided not to pursue it what's your budget situation?
actually I've had a couple of different situations my current one has been the most successful at a certain point in life my ex husband was an alcoholic and we got divorced back in the mid seventies and that left me with three teenagers actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets isn't it? it certainly is
but at any rate what happened was that I just absolutely put away all the credit cards I didn't rip them up I didn't send them back nothing I just put them away because there was one that it was really handy to have if I absolutely had to have something I could go use it
but mostly we just spent cash whatever we had and if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it but then as things improved once I got them all through college it came to the point where my parents came through the depression I'm not sure how old you are my parents too you were born in the late thirties or early forties but my late thirties
and my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house and that's kind of the way I was raised and so I'm not a very demanding person in that aspect for quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money
now meanwhile I had a building bank balance and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there and not ever have to spend any money on interest that's good
and that's the way I've operated ever since then it and if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it we buy what we just got through buying a twenty five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher
and we put twenty eight hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to japan which was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars and
we got a monster bill coming in but we also have zero interest being paid and we pay it off as it goes
and that's the way I do my credit cards now so we never really get that much over extended
I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards
but it's the fact that I have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full we're doing that we have this is our big we did redecorating two new pieces in the family room and new carpet we've just been spending spending spending
I'm envious I but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year we don't have that
it's time for you to do these things then? it's about time that we did that but the terrible part about it I've looked at it all and it all looks still pretty good to me why we need to replace it?
but unfortunately my wife really feels as though it's just been an inappropriate thing to that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it I say it might go for another thirteen but too late we'll never find that out this is so funny that's wonderful but you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it and
certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not
I don't spend that much money we just sort of have had too many obligations to we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school and that was the major decade of expenses so we feel as but as far as any formal budgeting we just apparently have been very fortunate when we want to go out to eat we go out to eat we never really have to program money for that or make choices but we don't have that uproarious a lifestyle after all we're
capital punishment out in california has had a lot of discourse in the paper apparently they haven't executed anybody since nineteen sixty seven I believe
that's as far back as I can remember that's before my time actually they
we lived in redwood city when we were out there
and we found that it was a very liberal kind of community but I really feel that the law enforcement community puts these people behind bars and then these lawyer groups get together and they extend beyond the normal appeal process and just drag his ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years and I think that there's something that has to be changed in the system to do that I think capital punishment was probably stringent enough but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way
do you feel as though there should be more transgressions that would be enforceable by capital punishment?
I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself it's at that point where they're saying here you're going on death row but you'll stay there for twenty years
and nothing is being done about it the laws exist and are frequently upheld in appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find and it's really getting out of hand in many states the term technicality the law enforcement community has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous acts are done to get somebody into a situation where they're going to be guilty of a crime
and whether the rights of that individual have been impuned or whether a policeman has just made a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it but the merits of the case in terms of the guy was a law breaker as being supportive
I'm at this juncture I'm not sure what constitutes a technicality that's what all these hearings are about and that's what all these court cases are about our glorious mayor here in washington is six days away from getting out of the can and he tried to appeal his conviction and it didn't work but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry in the old days and round about times of battle of hastings the villages if you were a transgressor they either drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and you were his slave and if he didn't like what you did he killed you
and that's pretty effective it's not good for civil rights I guess but it's pretty effective in that you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you'll perish either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods as man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions especially murder cases and that sort of thing
it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off for instance there's a case a few years back where someone who was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that the arresting officer did not read the defendant their rights
and where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
so what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?
I don't know what do you think? I don't know I had a little bit more time to think about it I was thinking of I don't know I started to think about all the big data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those demographics studies that they do that have who knows how much stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere
and I don't know I don't know what they actually have in there but I know they sell those
what about required drug testing as a condition of employment? that was the other one I was thinking of I think that's I know drugs are illegal
it thing actually I have worked at texas instruments
and they instituted a drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees
and actually to tell you the truth I really did not think much about it I hadn't it really didn't relate to me but there were some things that people brought up like what happens if they get a false positive what recourse do you have
and also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity and yet a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments although they don't admit to it actually a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure
so what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this although they don't actually execute it themselves it's really the government that so in that sense at least philosophically it's really borderline legal I think that a person's competence should be more determined by their actions and their behavior and if they're on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a chemical
what about this aids epidemic? where you find that certain people actually are criminal in their disregard for others these people that are carriers and that don't reveal it?
and of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't
it destroys their libido that would be kind of an extreme
if they ever I've heard of things like marking them somehow or something like that or putting them all someplace in a kind of
so what about that as an invasion of privacy? I guess it kind of borders on what do you value more the invasion of the person's privacy or the possible danger to other people
so it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society
I guess that's been the big role of government generally
it's supposed to have been that's kind of a difficult one to go into I mean that particular case
it because there's a lot of people that they could require obligatory aids testing for everyone because there's a huge part of the population not a huge part but a
a growing part the aids population that have it that don't know they do are spreading it
but again to require such a test and then to make it is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things I don't know I don't know how exactly I feel about that maybe chop their weenies off your turn
I don't think they should abolish it I think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got but not for petty theft?
for major things like premeditated murder mass murders that type of thing I don't think it should just be used loosely it should be used as a deterrent do you think?
or should it be used to prevent further crime?
to prevent these people from ever getting out on the street by some technicality
and they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before
and that's about the only thing for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter I don't think they should do that there's this old jewish saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
I guess if it was someone in my family I'd probably feel that way
I've never had anybody in my immediate family murdered and so I really wouldn't know but I feel like if I did I probably would feel that way one of the things I was thinking about is from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value so if you have someone that destroys that value then you want to take steps to minimize the loss
of course you have to also put value on the criminal
so if you terminate him that's a loss of value
that's true so if you weight everyone equally then you have to say the likelihood of not terminating him if you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person in other words you'd have to murder more than one other person in order to justify taking his life besides him
another way you could do it is weight this value by the value to society of the people which is pretty delicate thing to do but one way of doing it is by income so if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then he's obviously not worth very much
his life isn't worth very much then and so the likelihood that maybe expected murders by him is integrated over the income of the people that he murders is maybe a loss of eight hundred thousand dollars but if integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's easier to terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less which means
I suppose you could say that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation
potential that's the key right there potential
are they rehabilitative or not that's all fine and well and good philosophical but if you're involved yourself personally
I know I have a friend whose son was murdered on the night before his sixteenth birthday and let me tell you I knew them personally not intimately but quite well and you're talking about real trauma trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies
I can imagine the father of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get in terms of psychological impact and
was he murdered? did they find who killed him? they found him and he is on trial for capital murder
so it hasn't been a long time ago just recently actually he was convicted and of course now you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but
that appeals process it's what just drags out and out and out my brother in law here in texas my sister's husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy actually in houston and he
I'm not sure how it is in georgia but in pittsburgh the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that true for atlanta?
atlanta is kind of high it's lower than it has been in the past I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off and usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher I that's probably not true only for atlanta but for just about anywhere
what kind of crime problem do you usually run into? any specifics? from what's on the news there are very few actual robberies reported of residences what's more likely to occur is knocking over a small store or a car theft things of that nature very few assaults although on the college campuses there are cases of people getting from an automated teller and somebody trying to device a scam for getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners
but mostly petty things and nothing really too big
I guess here we run into that sometime but I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins
there are some but not very high as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either there were one case where this one guy was taking women from the teller and making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all
so that's kind of like a double assault there a strange case that happened about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
it was a free standing machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it
there's a crime for you
there's a crime but I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty innocuous although from what I hear in the news and I saw an episode of the t v show cops one time that was in pittsburgh
and it did surprise me because they were doing drug arrests and things like that but I don't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what's reported in the news at least it's not all that common
I don't know crime situations here they like I say lot of cases is usually just apartments and break ins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs drug related in most cases
it's not like it's someone do steal a or television or v c r or something like that it is for drugs because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it
so you really not making a sizeable profit so it's not really lucrative to take chances like that even though it does exist I live in an apartment right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the university of pittsburgh and the apartment would be very easy for just about anyone to break in
but even so it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to lock the doors when they go out and things like that
it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in
there's a t v and a v c r and they could get in pretty easy and especially since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open while they're upstairs playing music
it could still happen then
that's true but you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not participating in any type crime I guess there was one case I was surprised so happened this person worked at the same place I work for georgia tech and they work at the same place I did but I didn't know that they had been watching me because I was getting ready to go in my car one morning and the first thing they said is you don't have to be to work at eight shock
I guess you're probably in the same situation we're in we're kind of past having to provide child care our kids are grown up we don't have any grandchildren yet but they're how old are your children?
one's twenty six and the other is twenty one
so they're getting there they're going to be getting there
there's no prospects right away for anything to happen I see
but I have five children I have a eighteen year old son the rest of my girls are twenty three twenty six twenty eight and twenty nine
and I have three granddaughters right now and I one's in iowa
and she's a teacher and what she does is she teaches at a preschool
and so she kind of and they let her bring her little daughter in for free
so but she just works part time
then I have another daughter in bountiful utah and she has to work full time and it's just tearing her apart she has a private baby sitter
and the baby just screams the baby is seventeen months and she just screams
even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there they're not even there yet
it's hard we and then I have a seven month old granddaughter and her mother stays home and they live with us as orange county is really expensive
they live with us and so of course we love it because we get to see this cute little baby all the time but she just she used to work in the preschool and child care and she says after working in there and here she was a provider but there's only so much one person can do
she said it's so awful she said she'll never put her child in a preschool
I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere
but it's really very difficult and
what did you do when your kids were growing up? were you when the first ten or twelve years I stayed home
and then after that I went to work
and a couple of times I just then I had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job and then later I tried to get the baby to a baby sitter supposed to be good recommended person from the church and I knew her personally she had two kids of her own and everything but I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
first of all her children were sick all the time so when my son stayed over there he got sick
he got sick same thing that her kids had?
and so we didn't take her over there until about eleven o'clock then she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten but that day I was saying he's sick and she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have that's what he got goes so it's not like he's going to infect her kids but then what happened is I said he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway
you know what that woman sent him to kindergarten she sent him to kindergarten as soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nurse's office
guess so and then what happened is they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby sitter called her and they said that he's sick she wasn't home
all her kids were sick but she wasn't home and her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick why didn't she keep him home with her? she didn't do that so it got to the point where he's supposed to get out of kindergarten about two thirty and I had to leave work it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was still there at school and they were calling me and they said somebody's got to pick him up and I kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives two blocks away from the school I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff and he had a hundred and four fever they couldn't give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything
I was so furious I quit that job and I stayed home for awhile longer then I went and got a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
a little more flexibility you can come and go but I haven't had any really very good experience with child care
when our kids were small we had a couple of good women who would often get them to come to the house
you go first I have two kids I have one seven and one five
and they're in a public school here in tyler and I'm happy with it
I'm happy with the school it's great good teachers good curriculum they learn a lot they have no problems but I do live in the best part of the city though I live in the real richy part I guess I'm not
but everybody around me is but they're I have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town and their schools are kind of rundown and older and they don't really offer as much as the school that my girls are in I don't really think that's fair
but I'm happy with what they're in go ahead
it's pretty much what I was going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in
I grew up in new york and the place
or not new york city upstate new york
and I went to the city of rochester school district
and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs and we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but the difference in schools was pretty substantial
and one of the things that probably would have been better is if the entire county had just one school system
and that could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was all the very rich people move out to the suburbs and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with
as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses when I was a senior that some other schools had
and it so I think that one of the ways to help schools in general and get them all to a minimum level of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the problem with that is then the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools
it's kind of you end up like a dog chasing its own tail sort of also the the family environment you can come to south tyler where I live and you have got room mothers in every room you've got art mothers you've got every holiday there's parties all these kids have these really supportive parents always up there for something
you can go to north tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is
that has a whole lot to do with it as far as their learning if the parents aren't willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning they really don't have much of a chance at all why is that? why is that? why you asking
they just don't I'm up there at my kids school I know what they're learning and if they're up I call and find out is she having problems does she need help with anything she's doing fine and I know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated
they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and I'll get through the day and bring homework home and there's nobody to sit them down and say you're going to do this
just they take a notion to do it they do and that doesn't work either they have to have guidance and they can't just have it at school and then come home and there's nothing
I know that that was a big factor for me I ended up coming out of the public school system very well and was very good education
ended up getting some scholarships to go to college which is really nice
and I think the difference for me was that they were always there
was of course you're going to study and do well and that's the way of course are you
do your privacy being invaded at any time?
one of the things that I found to be an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the credit card bill that is something that is not required
and in fact it is actually prohibited but it doesn't stop many people from doing it and it's one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic research and to get your phone number on lists for phone solicitations that you can still I've always done that I started once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse and I say what are you going to do you going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine
I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all and then ultimately they say no you don't have to put it down but really it's part of this compliance thing
the thing I don't like I know that certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles
that really burns me because you're required you have to do that
and nowhere does it asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone
and I think that it's one thing to voluntarily give it because someone asks you can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody
that I don't think they have the right to do that I agree with you there
that's something that people have seen here's an easy way to make some money but I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not I've heard fairly recently some talk about that in my state the budget problems up here are pretty tense and people are looking for alternate ways of enhancing revenue is the phrase they use and they were talking about selling the d m v lists and there was a lot of consternation about that and the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea but it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made public that you don't know about
that's easy whenever you donate money to someone?
you become put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations
and then it kind of makes you feel from doing it again
like national public radio or any of the public stations
I think I sent in money once to public t v
and I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine
I it's like and it just started soon after I had done that one
and I just said this is terrible and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old alma mater in college
and it's one thing they don't sell the list but the thing that makes me mad is then they start getting other people the people do these phonathons
and they call you up and they actually happen to be people who graduated in your class or something like that and they say we know you you had contributed x amount last year can you do better this year? and hold on here
how do you know that? how do you know that? why you even telling me this? is it any of your business? it's one thing that I and the college knows that that's just our business there's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all
just and that was very offensive too I and so
last year the lotus development company the company that puts out one two three was planning on marketing a c d rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria
does the company you work for test for drugs?
they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting because when I went to work for them they didn't do that but since then they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company requests that we do that
how about you? we're not being tested for drugs at all our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section or its reasons for immediate dismissal
it says use of narcotics on company premises
so that's pretty general but I work for an environmental management firm
and I'm an engineer there but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites but I don't operate any machinery
now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program
because they're at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and I think that drugs they do test for drugs in that capacity but it's not their exclusive it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for
but I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field what is the nature of your company's business?
it's actually we do oil well services so a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies and they go out to we have engineers who go out to the client's oil well and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff so the clients are very concerned that the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their territory and everything but the thing that's interesting is that I'm an engineer a software engineer
and I work in the software house and everybody there are all software engineers they never go out to the oil rigs or anything and yet we're subjected to this policy the same one that all the engineers have to a little different actually but we have to go through the same thing it's a little different than a lot of drug policies in our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you and then if you get injured on the job if you trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away
other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first particularly we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol and they didn't find any problem with that but
that's been an issue in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening in fact they'll have these little parties and people will just get I've my brother lives where I work and I have many a time called him to come get me but they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg
but I think drug testing and I don't know I think it's got some relevance but I think its relevance is pretty limited I think in your case I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing
I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident
it's really bizarre particularly where we are I there was a story of a woman last year who actually did slip on the ice and sprained her ankle and she was a personnel secretary and she had to get tested and I don't know I'm ambivalent about the whole thing I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense and it's like employments are contractual by nature anyway
but I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job where I had to do a drug test and it was kind of a long story but it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through and it amounted to going in before any of these interviews I'm not even working for this company I'm going in for interviews and they flew me out to chicago and before I went into any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical they said it was going to be a physical and actually beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening but I had forgotten about that and so basically I'd already peed off in that morning and when I got in there I wasn't able to give a full sample and so they made me sit and wait for forty five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again
and the procedure is utterly humiliating you go in there with the doctor he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you what do you think?
I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago because I'm not that old yet
I can be but go ahead
I know that obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change you didn't have video games you didn't have home computers you didn't have xerox machines
you try to you go into a business today and you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper and it's almost inconceivable now because the xerox machines and everything have become such a part of the way we live we fax everything and
we don't even wait for the mail anymore
a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail and you had to do something this was concerning the s e c and so if they had business to do they had to finish it three days in advance so they could get it through the mail
and now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute because you can get it there in a matter of minutes through a fax machine
and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder
because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute you're expected to and I recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse it should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmothers had to bake brownies and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us
and we have no down time we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to
so we keep moving we don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing so we have no relaxation time in between
so they say that's really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to deal with that and get your time in between things
so that's good that's an interesting point but I just think our family lives have changed drastically
and I think that's of course a part of it is technology our kids where would they be without nintendo and their t v shows and some of that is really bad I think but we have all single families so many single families now a lot of working both parents are working so there's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
there's that and there's the fact that nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country
you're probably right and I'm an o b nurse and that's never really occurred to me but that's interesting I never really thought about it that way
I saw the numbers on that awhile back and I was uh huh so that's true when is this good or not good
in terms of the long term effect on america in terms of the culture and everything I don't know we don't know that yet
an extremely large part of the next generation is going to be second generation from immigrant parents I don't know either that's true
and they're going to be really struggling and I don't think that america is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good
it's no longer the accomplishment that it once was and not that many people are really trying I don't think that's kind of scary that's true but I it's just very very different and I guess every ten years it's just been very different
and I don't know what's going to happen I know what I'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers
and they've got their homes and they've got
julie are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with special care for elderly? I don't know my grandfather is ninety two years old
and he is still living by himself my grandmother died a couple of years ago but he doesn't want to move away he lives in a little farmhouse on a farm
and he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home
is he able to still do everything himself pretty well? he was until this operation he has arthritis
and now I don't really think he's doing that well and a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him and I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot
but my great grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three
and died six weeks after they put him in the home
and I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather's feelings because I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left and for a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over
and I'm just here for the rest of the stay and so I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day to day needs
they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day to day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore I know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home they generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all younger than your grandparents they were in their eighties that type of thing but I did I guess when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically but I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
and that's difficult part because I think what they often get used as is almost like a very high level or long term care similar to a hospital
I know here in saskatchewan we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in four levels and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long term hospital care generally are not able to look after themselves to a very great extent physically often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or physical and mental handicaps where they really require twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal
but I think that it can be helpful in that it gets people the level of physical care they need but I don't at least I think some nursing homes do that but I think a lot of nursing homes really are guilty of neglect
and I think it happens more in areas where it's a broad social medical system where there's government medical care and that kind of thing if it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding I think that a majority of the places in the u s there is some government aid available but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay
and if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely
what kind of crime do you think is the most prevalent in our society?
probably robberies people stealing from each other such as new york city?
is that what happens up there a lot? that's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen that's the most prevalent crime the ones that really add up after a while far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually I wonder if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because so many people use it and even though just using is not really it is a crime
that is a crime I guess when you count all the little things that people do like speeding is a crime that's true
I break that law every day but I was staying in the realm of felonies versus misdemeanors and drug use
actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor but what kind have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything?
I've been caught with marijuana before so I guess that was a crime I got a year's probation for that but that's not that much those aren't
it wasn't that big a deal I
when I think of crime I think of stuff that affects other people like people getting killed or raped I think rape is one of the worst crimes I think it is in some ways it's almost worse than murder it's very degrading
and murder is hard on the people that were related to
it is a rather final solution though
once a person's gone then it's but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life what do you think is an appropriate punishment for things such as rape or murder or something like that
for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is it's a pretty good thing I agree with that
they have that down here in florida still the electric chair and I think virginia does too up here
do they? I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy and I guess usually they're always sure they got the right guy but I think the appeal process takes too long
so do I I think it from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
if that the sooner a year's plenty of time for something to come out I guess
then there's been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and they it's oops but the system isn't perfect it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
you do the best you can to make it perfect you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
but I think you have to accept some of the errors I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment for murderers
I don't know if it would or not though I don't think it's so much of a deterrent as it is a good way for vengeance for the relatives and family members you know what I mean? and society probably too
just general society to
it kind of gets it off their chest
it does and it decreases the prison population which is significant
I know that a lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other
and they're the kind of crimes of passion and stuff like that
I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead you might be able to stop people they're thinking about it they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught generally the crimes of passion and things like that are not premeditated
they can be but usually they aren't
they're spur of the moment
that's right and the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those individuals I think that you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time
they could probably do it again they would have no problems doing it again
that's right they didn't have any time doing it the first time and I think locking them up for fifty years doesn't do any good because as a taxpayer I'm going to pay one and a it your turn
I start we keep a budget to an extent and we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid about yourself? I have to say I really don't have a budget both my wife and I grew up in families of rather modest means and our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class I guess you might say and we're both so frugal that we really don't need a budget we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing
I guess that really is sort of keeping a budget you stay within your means we stay within our means but we don't do it by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically
although we just moved to california and the cost of living here in california is rather pathological
housing prices are from four to ten times more expensive than they were where I came from in dallas
you moved from dallas to san francisco so that presents a real shock that is a hugh difference
actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to california but
but you have good sour dough and it's a beautiful place to live it's god's country
and one way you know that is that only god can afford it
so budget is not a problem for us at least it hasn't been it may be at this point but up until this point it really hasn't been when I was in undergraduate school a long long time ago I noted that the starting average monthly salary for engineers in my discipline was six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that
and I noted at that point that if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so I stopped worrying about money
and it never have worried about money since then
that's a system too sometimes it's a bit of a problem because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should but I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of investments but
then again you said you are able to take trips and you do obviously have enough to live on so I guess you're indirectly budgeting just bye bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal in spending the money
so that's a form of budgeting it's kind of a strange topic for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money I guess we're both lucky in that regard then
how big is your family?
we have one on the way I see
my wife and then we're having one on the way in september how once you get ten children though you may have
I think it's just going to be one
how about yourself? I have two kids one nine and one thirteen
and they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point
do they budget at all? do you have them on an allowance? I give them an allowance and they I basically give my son ten dollars a week and I put half of it in the bank and I give him the other half in cold cash
and he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank but at least it isn't burning a hole in his pocket
if he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually
I lived over in europe for a couple of years I lived in germany and in germany they don't have the jury system what they do is they have three judges basically and you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not our judicial system is in such total chaos
I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it when you have a man that's signed a statement saying he's guilty we have a family called all day family they were all murdered
all the people signed confessions they went to a trial by jury they been trying these people now for twenty two years ever since I was a child
and what they've done is they've bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they've done has nothing to do with justice whatsoever it's one of those things I would have to look at it if they did it with just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know what's good and what isn't they'd be able to say I'm sorry you can't use this as evidence because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you wouldn't have this theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the jury and then the judge says disregard that come on any jury's not going to disregard the evidence
that's true I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself that may very well be
I hold it in the utmost contempt
my favorite is the police department they're not aimed at the criminal the judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and I we have work schedules we can be called at work we have social security numbers they can trace us down we have telephones then we have checkbooks criminals have none of these things they're real difficult to catch and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas we write a check so where do you think they target their efforts? that's true you
they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals how would you go about changing it?
that's a I've nailed the problem down but I
leave the details up to somebody else
I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about I think to begin with you would have here in atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical yet you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets
I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from talking about the lawyers what might very well cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases it's kind of do it in the similar vein like v c r or television repair if you take your t v in a lot of these t v repair places will say I'll repair your t v for a hundred dollars and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars if he comes in and says I'll repair your v c r or somebody else's v c r for a hundred dollars gets in there maybe it's a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that whether it's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else you get x dollars for that case and that's it
I firmly believe in that none of this
because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney?
and here's this bum that didn't have a job and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford that's true
who's paying for that?
you're talking to part of them that's paying for that
and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it that's right it's amazing and when you stop and look at it the judges they're all former lawyers
that's another problem I think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it
they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever and with that type person running it you could expect that you why don't you go ahead and start
I think the court systems could stand some improvement trial by jury is good but a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which I don't think is all the time good because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me I don't know so you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence?
I think so I attended a trial in germany when I was a student and that's the sort of system they have
the trials are held by a panel of three or four judges who are they're like lawyers I guess they're experts in the law
and there really isn't a jury and they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and they
I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because the judge is also sort of a jury but I'm not sure I like that I think I prefer the jury system myself
you think you prefer the jury? you think your chances are better? actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual that's where you really need a jury of peers because anytime the government is the government against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens
that's true I think that's really the only thing I guess where I would like to see the system change is there ought to be a I guess I don't think that juries need to decide sentencing all the time
I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that or
sometimes the sentencing is not fair the jury I guess they do decide that but I'm like you in a case like that most of the time its I don't know maybe I'm too conservative when it comes to that the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases
if you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
but people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe a little bit naive
in texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
it's kind of a hanging jury atmosphere
but in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way but I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
I kind of like that system
that's not a bad system but I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit
but the thing is too maybe they need more of a expert types to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
insurance cases and things like that
where and there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of people's heart strings and making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
putting on a act or whatever
so I think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but
I've had three boys through some child care each one of them and now they're in school so it's all over but I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want
I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months is that right I guess the only rule I can think of is that I like to look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that if they're associated with a college or a university they're usually a pretty good bet
I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something you'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care
I guess not I suppose you're absolutely right there for profit places I would really look at them awfully carefully
but when my kids were young I was teaching at a university and the child care center associated with our university was quite good so I felt confident that they'd do right
of don't everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? for their pet theories or some such thing? you mean learning type actual experiments they would have to get your permission
but I suppose if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another I guess that's true but I never had bad experience in that respect of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents and they pretty good people
the thing I really worry about is the sexual abuse cases you read about
and you'd just feel awful if something like that happened I never really worry very much about it I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public so I never really worried too much about that being the case with my boys
I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but
I don't think it's as common as the newspapers would make you believe
and another thing is cost I mean that
I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now and in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare
in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school and I'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult and I think it was the right thing to do
and we just decided that we would do it and we went ahead but not everybody can make that choice and even though my wife wasn't working we did have one or another of the boys in child care just for part of the day or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house and so on so we did look around
I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not so I would always trust her judgment on that
I'm just thanking heaven my husband just got a new job his last company he was only working four days a week
so it's and he just got a new job he's getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not there's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid so do it as long you can
I suppose but I think you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them
and the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere you have to start wondering if they don't want you
you have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care?
I have one but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while but I really think the news reports tend to sensationalize the problems
I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and things like that rather than these really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy this is true current affair can get several shows child cases
with regard to jury trials I really feel as though whatever system has been used historically is really the only kinds of things that you can use because the jurisprudence is based on accumulated body of law and if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards
so I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think?
I don't think so possibly in the jury selection would be the only
just for example what we're seeing in california I guess it makes you wonder had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome and the problems that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating just makes you wonder whether or not they won't maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
and the other two guys sat in the car that's bad
and they didn't get beat up
it rodney got beat up because he involved himself in some self destructive behavior
and just like the burning and looting is self destruct
everybody says this is the nineties
and they're going to rebuild and it'll be even better what do you think some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area?
that's right with everybody with that mind set that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto
they're only going to suffer and you might even be able to use it for a bombing test site
they're only going to suffer they've defeated themselves with their looting and violence I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the tape and everybody is saying this is going to be a new era and we're going to reexamine this thing the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed they're a bunch of animals how can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything forty deaths there are forty people that are dead as a result of that I know
it's really ridiculous and I'm just trying to determine how you weigh rodney getting the hell beat out of him against forty deaths
against forty other people being and there's no other I'm not exactly sure what the circumstances surrounding the deaths and I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and pursued it because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing those deaths
is it a looter that got shot by a store owner? I no tears
or just an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what but I suspect a number of them
you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot in the street
or beaten and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people rather than stop and there would have been just nothing but carnage after if I'd been at the wheel
no one would have stopped me
that's exactly how I feel too they wouldn't have stopped my car for anything had I seen them coming but I was just wondering since you're back east and a little closer to the bigger cities than we are in idaho here I'm inside the beltway
you know how they always say inside the beltway they think thus and I say wait a minute I'm inside the beltway and I don't think like that
I'm a government employee
in what section of the government do you work? I'm with the f b I
that's interesting and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because rick who's another government employee wanted segments of my speech that were done a year ago
and he wanted another collection a year later
and so this is my seventh call a year ago I did eleven calls
I see and so that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate
around here we have a program where we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers and we keep the newspapers in a they're collected twice a month and the trash and this bottled stuff that is put in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck so they actually have about three passes at this collection one for the regular trash one for the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers sounds
but I gather you do not separate the bottles and cans
they do that on the truck
they separate them as they dump them and one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there and I think they're running out of the sanitary landfill is running out of course you being from new mexico you've probably been to washington especially if you're your present location
you must have come to washington at least once I know not only have I come to washington but I find it very amusing that the thing that was just instituted here is very similar that is we also have blue bins we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and landfill space is in deed the driving factor here and in fact despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still very hard to come by
you've got a lot of nothing out there
they got there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
what unique things you think that you can do about it in los alamos?
other than nuking it other than nuking it
in fact los alamos has done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general it involves for instance creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and other things from waste material in general and purify the waste of specific nasty elements
that's pretty upscale trash situation I don't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques getting rid of the heavy metals
and the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody made some special polymers that have the ability to make certain actinide elements adhere to them
they've looked at plutonium and uranium and some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
and again this is driven by all of the documentation and e s and h considerations that people are worrying about much more than they should actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable
back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center and in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper
that's certainly getting into the swim of things I think it should go to the heart of the matter though and say guy everybody gets five pounds of garbage that they can throw away but more than that every week you've got to pay by the pound I think they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff I think that's a wonderful idea
the only alternative I would see is if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more
and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
of course those big trucks probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
we have we used to when I was younger
we'd go every weekend
but we haven't done whole lot of it lately I'm kind of into it I'm kind of a sailor
I'm up in minneapolis now but I was in florida so I was kind of into it for a while there
were you sailboating? for the most part I had a little sail
we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here just motorboat's all we what part of texas you from?
nacogdoches whereabouts is that?
that's between houston and dallas it's the oldest town in texas is that right? that's pretty wild
we have lake sam rayburn out here and lake nacogdoches so we do a lot of boating on so you got some lakes around you can do that on
you do skiing and stuff or little bit
just got through snow skiing
just came back from denver but that sounds good our the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
it was heavy when we were there though I didn't see any boats there though
not too many but I just got back from a weekend we went and had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing it was pretty nice but I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I did a lot of sailing on and stuff
that's a lot of fun but my parents are pretty big sailors too they're kind of into it
all we have up here mostly bass boats I guess fishing's a pretty big thing
lot of fishing going on up here so where about in texas is that? is that centrally located or
it's you ever heard of lufkin? what major city is nearby?
houston and that's south or north of there or something?
let me see houston's north
dallas is south that sounds pretty good does I guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or
it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons
probably seventies eighties in the afternoon that's pretty temperate that's not too bad but have you done any other boating then or
I hadn't done any lately but that's all I used to have a friend that his daddy owned a boat shop
and when I was in high school we used to go boating every day just about that's great I
and we had a different boat every day that's fantastic I used to kind of be that way myself when I lived in north western florida in the panhandle I used to sail about every day I'd go to work
I'd like to do some sailing it's a lot of fun it's especially if you get a pretty fast boat those catamarans are pretty fast
what you can actually
if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that or they just actually I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life my family's pretty into it
and I took sailing lessons when I was about six and then
is it pretty easy? it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it
so it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of I think and generally everybody I've known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters which is fine
that's about all we have lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may never have tried anything like catamaran
and that's when you really start getting into speed some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast
I didn't know that they get pretty quick but
that would be something
I haven't personally done that but the races I work with a guy right now that races catamarans in the summertime
and he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good
what lake do you all use? he's from detroit
so he usually goes on one of the great lakes and does his sailing for me I go back to orlando in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast we're about thirty miles from coco beach and the east coast and there's a lot of places there you can go so that's a good thing
but so what do you do for a job?
I build transformers is that for t I or
it's for cooper industries are they primarily electronic then? that
they have a worldwide but
all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that
how do you like it down there in texas? it's real nice
been here all my life no doubt
I've never been to texas I've been to oklahoma but that's about as far as
oklahoma's nothing like it that's good because I didn't like oklahoma that well
I guess by what you said you don't feel your privacy has been invaded anytime recently?
not really the only thing that annoys me is when people call and you have solicitation calls
that's the only thing that bothers me that's not really invading my privacy
do you feel that yours is invaded? I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means I would there's a lot of times though you get those calls when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot and next thing you know someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to tell them that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you and keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but I don't know that you could call that invading my privacy because if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look I want my name unlisted or want my
but that doesn't work it doesn't?
because a lot of times they dial sequentially they get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything
you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company
or you or the newspapers they just dial randomly and stuff the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
and while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they you call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing
and the local papers ask them to remove your number from their list and you call up during regular hours they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their lists
but the orlando paper they refused to take it off of the lists and they call every month
and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have let me ask you about this here's something that has been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a lord and taylor company
they're a department store
she received a bill from them that she had visited some and I think it was there in florida maybe it was in miami that she had visited a store there and they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
and the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving
and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
and I've heard recently that this is a common occurrence where people are using they use joe blow's social security number and can potentially ruin someone's credit
if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address and their mother's maiden name you can basically become that person
if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to
and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove that it wasn't her if it was some coming into the store and stuff then whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of document
and the signature they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature they'll have to eat the charge
but if the has her social security number I'd be real concerned that she's not blacklist on telecredit or something?
because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there she probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle we got it cleared up eventually what happened kids too?
you laugh how many what ages? twenty seven up and we had five you've been through the fun part and how about yourself? I have a four and a half and a three
so it's I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way it's done now and then
when mine were growing up I did some traveling but not that extensively but I always just made it a point to spend about ten minutes with each one of them so it was an hour but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them what was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest? six years so they were all real close?
that's tough that's a lot of time
we look back and wonder how we did it did you both work? your wife too?
she never did qualify that she worked at home I'm sure
but that's both my husband and I work and sometimes I feel like by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening
maybe thirty minutes max
that's plenty though and he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking and then I spend time with them while he's doing other stuff and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it but it's neat it's straight and I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids
with kids you're not going to have a neat house I've accepted that too
and it's tough to find time especially with both of them working that's true it is that's true
and you just have to set the time and say this is going to be it that's true and we do a lot of that on the weekends we try to spend saturdays together
if my husband golfs he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence
and we do a lot of family things together we're kind of going the other direction this weekend we're planning a trip just he and I this is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago that's good too
that's good that way too I decided that you need that once in awhile that you need to plan the quality time and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty four hours a day
they say all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
and as the kids got older I made them help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too or whatever
and and they think that's a family activity that's great fun
and if my daughter's mommy can I help you with the laundry? of course you can
just keep them talking that way
but another thing we used to do is have family councils every sunday night and what would you do what?
discuss everything that didn't agree with them and we'd take turns being president
and everyone would get one vote and I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two but it never worked that way so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week
and we could bring up stuff too and then
and that was always good time we really got to know the kids well I imagine and I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
in fact they were all in over the weekend for easter I
that's wonderful I was raised in that type of family where you don't disobey me you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it we did too
and I remember the one daughter saying we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
and she said I don't make fun of your friends so why make fun of mine?
kind of hit us between the eyes you don't think of it that way do you
but that was always good quality time for us that's good I like that idea and then never attend
but if they missed it they had to abide by the rules whatever was voted on
and they'd show up I think that's great
and we'd usually take notes
and the younger kids or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another
but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us and they loved it I think that's true I can remember times my parents would say what do you think would be a fair punishment
and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done
so I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves
but I feel for you and your husband why is that? two of my kathy?
do you so what is your family what do you usually do as far as budgeting?
we have a very detailed budget because my husband is a finance major
and we have money that we take out each month for food and for gas and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for christmas and for other things
then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our needs and wants list
and so the things like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then for the things that we want
and we're continually putting into those each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item
so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for my husband is a finance major also
and we kind of have the same plan we have one credit card and every month we put the same amount in for retirement and our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby so we're budgeting each month an allowance for his education starting now
so that's in our budget every month now that's the newest addition but we too do the same thing as far as we have a set amount we take one big vacation a year and then maybe three small vacations so an exact amount that we spend on that each year and
we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money instead of just writing checks for things if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here I see
and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for the vacation that we put in for christmas you have a separate account for that then?
a lot of that I don't know how safe it is I guess we keep it all in a safe here at the house I see
and so it's actually pulled out then we keep our I see
we have a savings account for the kids education that money goes into there each of our we have three children so they each have their own account I see
that money is put into each month does your husband deal in stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff? does he invest in that and for long term? he does somewhat he does somewhat
we have an investment plan I guess he does
but we have really found this is the first year we've done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money because you've sat down with a piece of paper and said let's see what are we going to what goes into that particular thing? it's vacations christmas
christmas birthdays car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental
and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from we have it
and when we see something on sale instead of just looking in our checking account and saying we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill everything's taken care of
and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
what do you do as far as I take it do you run the family budget as far as groceries and that sort of thing?
I do all the money and what's that?
all the money is turned over to me do you have a set amount that you spend each month or how do you work that?
I have a set amount it's very generous and I usually have extra
and so then that can go either back into our checking account or I can just carry it over
there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over
but that's completely up to me how I do that and then because I don't work I stay home I do too I stay home also
and so it's kind of my money and I also get my own money to do what I want to go to lunches and do that kind of thing
we have a clothing envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing
it really works out great we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and we're what as far as big things like something comes up and you have to buy a t v or a big item for the house how do you have a household?
we have a household budget we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year
and also we need a new bed and so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards
