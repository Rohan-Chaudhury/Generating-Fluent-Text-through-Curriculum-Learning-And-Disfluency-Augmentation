have you had that experience recently? recently I can't really say recently but I think about uh about a year ago uh I bought a product from some company down at uh in atlanta georgia I believe it was one of these uh one of these uh mixers these like these juice machines and uh the uh the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay oh yeah
but I found that uh it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh after oh
even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about uh three weeks of use and I don't think it was my fault because I you know I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it but uh it was really uh it was I had to send it back after like you know the third week because I realized it was like it was not something was very very wrong with the blade uh what about you? well I don't have so much trouble with products as service
uh huh I don't feel like that's as big a problem I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly
uh huh and I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent
uh huh uh the one I have now is okay most of the time
uh huh but that's it but that's that's probably the worst my daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed uh james avery I don't know if you have that up there but it it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things
uh huh and uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now uh huh
uh huh and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said oh this was just obviously yanked
uh huh this was yanked I mean they were so rude about it
right and so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said well it's not guaranteed and I said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway
uh huh so we got the kind we wanted and I was really disappointed with that I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
uh huh and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and I called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and I said my goodness I said you've been very nice what's your name and she told me and I said well I really appreciate it I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager so
well at least you're talking to somebody who counts right so I felt kind of good about that you know I didn't even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything uh huh
right but I just felt like well at least I did something maybe they'll fix it they might work on that you know
right right but I find attitudes are more of a problem service is more of a problem
I find up here in the northeast we have uh well we have these mail order companies like l l bean and uh they are famous for I guess having really top notch service they've got uh really
I mean I've I've I I have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore uh they'll they'll actually do things like this I mean they're really they they bend over backwards service wise for you I've uh I've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call that's really great
I guess if if you call the any eight hundred number uh if you you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get uh the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies and um actually I've tried that with a few companies lately and they've most of them have been pretty good but I I was one reason why I like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through bean or though uh I guess bean's one of bean's big competitors is land's end out in uh I guess it's wisconsin somewhere they they are uh they're very good about uh huh
like the customer is always right and you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding and uh they usually get you know they they make things are they make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise that's really good it use to be like that uh huh but I don't think most places are like that anymore
yeah well I think I guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is I guess there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are uh you know things are getting rough out there there's a lot of you know the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know hi
hi uh uh I I should say something
uh huh that I'm the uh least informed this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic but it's I'm the least informed person in the whole united states
this has not been determined yet but I I I've never read a newspaper in my entire life and I've I I never watch t v news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off but
any particular reason? well no I I've I've explored that with lots of people uh they've tried to lock me up and uh things like that but uh uh I'm basically not interested and I also find the uh everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and and off the uh uh what am I trying to say uh I do learn about things largely from friends
uh huh huh and I occasionally will read something like the new york review of books you know someone will write a book about something and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier
uh huh but it and somehow and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always so uh covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it but I mean I don't think it's just that I'm lazy
I really don't I I I like to refer to this as sort of consumer report phenomenon which is everybody that I know reads consumer reports so the people who do feel that consumer reports does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest but assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty uh huh uh huh uh huh
and uh I guess you could explain it two ways and and the cynical view is well these things aren't doing a very good job at all and the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or uh particularly interested in buying something as a you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things uh huh right yeah
and I think the same thing is true with news if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and especially the better papers the the times the wall street journal the washington post give you a reasonable idea uh huh yeah
if you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much right doesn't want
let me ask by the way just for the record I I'm I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them so I mean I'm not being elitist in that sense I hope uh
well I mean there's there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things yeah what
and most people think it is and I can I can you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it yeah by the way when you say most people think it is I think it's like ninety nine point ninety nine think it is percent
I don't think it's that high oh you don't?
I know a lot of people who may watch the t v news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper right
and I think they're saying well if something's really important I'll at least find out that it happened yeah
and and that's a that's is a reasonable start and for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked uh and if something important happened it was covered on t v and I could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about uh huh
and I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels yeah uh I did on the uh the supreme court hearings the for uh uh the whole business of uh see I actually have a a
clarence thomas or yeah the thomas and anita hill business
right I I mean that's that's the closest thing I deeply cared about that
uh huh uh and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine and when I arrived at her house she was engrossed in that we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more and I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on but even then I didn't end up doing it on my own uh uh
yeah I stayed as far away from those as I could uh huh
I decided I didn't want to waste the time I had I guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with oliver north hearings and afterwards decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in and that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out right right yeah uh huh yeah do you ever read
uh a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either uh elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users
uh huh and uh I know the the government is uh you know gives drug tests to all new entrants all new applicants coming into government
uh huh and and I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it I I'm I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian
and and I I feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background of course we're we're being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks and and so uh but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that
sure sure and uh I have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to whatever it is to to you know break this uh activity huh
uh huh of course if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope
yeah what's your uh feeling?
uh well I guess I I guess I'm probably a little more to toward the other direction
uh well I guess mainly because uh it's I well like there's two sides to it I guess uh one is that uh if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then I I think that that you know I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot uh but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business uh and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition uh you know we've had I guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years I guess uh huh
maybe a little longer well I think uh the the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that yeah so eighty years or so yeah yeah
uh so I you know it's it's hard to I guess for me to justify what seems like you know basically a breach of the first you know freedom from uh search and seizure you know uh on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows well the thing of it is the the that that is uh uh in in many respects uh uh you know just just I think an over simplification
I mean prohibition certainly didn't last I I think there there's so much criminal activity uh that people go into to to support drug habits
well but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right? yeah you know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that yeah
oh yeah sure well it goes back to that again if you look at prohibition I mean because it's illegal it costs more if it was legal I mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce I I I must admit that
and clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it yeah
but yeah get uh yeah I I must admit that the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and and the costs to society yeah
oh yeah well that's why there's you know people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's ridiculous amounts of money but I I I I think that that the that you know the being in law enforcement you know they I I probably have a kind of a draconian philistine attitude toward it
and but but the uh uh I I really feel as though the interdiction effort is is as soon as you you get rid of one goon that's that's that's involved in drugs and
oh yeah interdiction's hopeless I mean yeah and then another another one will jump up
there's no way you're ever going to win that but we we see
the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is I mean that's a losing fight yeah as soon as we wind up uh uh you know for well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand but but people want to get get stoned
yeah yeah and I I don't see that
well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people I mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen? yeah
I don't think you can I mean you know I'm you know was raised with being a very strong bible work ethic so you know I'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people uh huh
so you know yeah I can really relate to yeah everybody ought to do their own share you know I don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff uh huh but you know
so um how do you feel about the crime in your city? is it uh
well um minneapolis isn't too bad uh I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders uh huh
uh that's kind of gone up in scale and and some other things uh I personally had a little experience the other day uh somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck oh really
but actually you know when you look at at minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it's really quite a bit better uh because I came from florida uh huh
and in orlando there's crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever so oh yeah what part of california are you from? san jose california
oh really? I have a good friend there here you know the real problems are the gangs
yeah a lot of gang related a lot of murders uh just in general the whole we've only been here a couple of years uh before that we lived in colorado but in comparison to colorado it's real noticeable
oh yeah uh huh I mean you can just feel I mean I can just sense I mean I won't even I won't go to the grocery store at night
yeah yeah that's you know and it it's that kind of thing and uh
that's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like yeah we have a neighborhood watch program in the house uh the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce uh home theft burglary and things of that sort
sure do you have that where you live or
well uh interestingly enough right before I moved up here I'm an intern and then I go back down in may uh huh
uh but in orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it uh we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks oh no
and one of the things that I I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there uh huh
uh because they were just it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know uh huh
and then the houses were left unguarded uh but yeah I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that's a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch yeah
well you know uh also I've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home like on the weekends
oh is that right? a high percentage of uh free time I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is uh spent doing yard work outdoors
oh so they wait while you're out outdoors they know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in slip in slip out you know that's amazing they know exactly what they're going for
yeah so I've heard that's really on the rise as far as uh you know a new type of crime uh
yeah it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter yeah really you know unfortunately yes
yeah unfortunately it's starting to really you know look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day uh huh yeah
like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at minneapolis because he's from detroit uh huh
and uh the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced uh uh huh but uh yeah I guess I mean
I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in minneapolis I'm not real sure uh yeah it helps to know your neighbors you know they give you you're supposed to make lists of uh cars like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if I see a car that's unfamiliar we we have a list is that what you you did in your program? where you have a list of license plates? pretty much yeah
yeah I was I was basically involved in that in the organization of it uh huh
and then I left right in the middle of it I'm not sure where we went from there oh uh huh but yeah well
yeah that that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that sure uh huh
I mean you you hate to be paranoid but there are really only so many things you can do you can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program you know uh as a woman not go out at night yeah
yeah uh you can do that which is what I choose to do
yeah one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited yeah
even even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps uh huh
it's against the law to do a lot of things you know they could basically uh when I was getting robbed down in florida I was really considering electrifying doors um things like that like uh huh that's uh huh
they did in miami that time but it's not uh if you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home it's considered self defense though that's not always true it isn't?
no there was a there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed uh huh
and essentially what he had done is set a a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home uh huh huh
the guy came in while he was home and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned he didn't die but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement really
yeah so that really that makes you think you know yeah
it's like your hands are very much tied yeah well I think if if you had a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's
do you know anyone that uh is is in a nursing home or has ever been in one?
no but I my grandparents were looking into it before so I know what they've said uh huh
uh huh well I'm trying to think my uh uh wife's grandmother had alzheimer's and they were going to put her into a a nursing home and uh they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance I mean she sort of went you know bananas
oh they thought it was too much of a bother and they couldn't couldn't deal with her so I guess you need to uh know whether it's a you know a no deposit no return kind of thing whether
right if they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're going to have you know put in there too yeah
because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still right
they wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well have their own room right
my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that uh there was a retirement hotel and then a uh there was some sort of full time care place that was also associated with it so for uh the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else
uh huh and then uh as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to uh provide full time care and uh she didn't have to do anything anymore but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's I don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the the reason is but I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something
well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help yeah
they need health care so they're already ill before they go right
that's probably a large factor yeah if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are then you only go there as a last resort
uh huh or people send you there as a last resort
right right that's what my grandparents it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them uh huh
so that was their thinking somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency right
and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time right
I guess that's a problem too for people wait lists and all yeah I guess
that uh you can't always get in when you want too and of course you can't just sit around and wait right when you need it you need it I guess yeah
and the money is also another issue how you're going to pay for it right
at that stage of life you only have so much money left and I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings yeah
I mean it is kind of fair but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise sure
so it's another problem and you probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
right right so it it's just so complicated anymore I think people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore yeah well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing
it's just a shame that's the way it has to be I think the retirement home idea's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay yeah
and cause like if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you to have friends right
yeah I've known quite a few people that have uh gone to retirement communities I don't know if they have them back there but here in california and in
so have you heard about saturns?
I've heard some about saturns I don't know a lot about them I haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the I guess the japanese cars ooh that's great actually that's kind of the type of car that I I'm thinking about we might get saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a a saturn dealer this this offshoot of g m uh huh
yeah and uh supposedly they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard
um yeah I've heard a lot of people like them uh yet I don't know whether I would buy saturn or not at this point I'm kind of my card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh well like what?
well let's see I I like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind
and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person who's working on it cause I do almost all my own maintenance and uh those types of things uh huh
and I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it's just not very it's not very almost unlikely at this point yeah
and uh yeah I've got a sixty five mustang and I and I do the work on most of the work on that myself ooh
uh huh and when I look at modern cars and stuff like that I just say I will never do that with the modern cars it's not worth my time you can't get in there you can't do anything
yeah and it's so complicated too I look at it and I say boy you know I I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that
well I've got an eighty three saab uh huh
and I find that for a normal you know everyday things it's really very easy to work on and so uh you know I'm kind of spoiled I used to have a chevy uh huh
with a three fifty in it yeah
and uh I really liked working on it uh cause it was pretty easy too it was about a nineteen seventy so I'm kind of uh biased in that and you know I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore yeah
and that's kind of that's that's probably one thing I'd look at I think another thing I'd look at is safety yeah that's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about actually the car one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags huh
that's a real nice car I think yeah
I've driven some uh tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips uh as rental cars uh huh
and I've always been very impressed with the taurus it's a really nice car I think it's very it's a stylish car both inside and out it's comfortable to drive uh reasonable performance and this is out in california where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore yeah
uh I've been real impressed with that and I didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now ninety yeah or excuse me the ninety twos the ninety twos had dual air bags
uh huh this newest model you could get them with duals
oh I think that that's excellent
that's excellent because yeah but the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars actually my my wife and I are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so so we're actually been looking around and thinking about things
oh we'd like to get like a oh I don't know what do you call it? a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know
uh huh year old ninety two or something like that uh huh sure those are see if we
yeah that that would be a good deal to go with and the other thing we're looking at is the saturns too
okay because they looked really nice
uh huh what do you what do you looking for in in those? what what attracts you to the saturns? or or of course we've already talked you know the taurus is safe but what kind of things are you looking for? well the saturns you can get air bags in them I don't think you can get dual side air bags
uh huh but one of the the two things that I'm really the the I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart that doesn't have problems
uh huh you set down you look at consumer reports we've been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the u s auto makers when you do that
yeah because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the taurus is one of the highest u s cars
uh huh and the other one is are the saturns
uh huh so those two things and then you know we kind of want a four door okay
recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know three or four years ago I'm a senior in in uh college now
uh huh and uh I can't really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system I went to was uh really superb even though it was a public school system really?
yeah I feel that my uh I'm a junior in college now and I go to tech georgia tech? oh okay yeah
and I I got a friend who goes there by the way I want to talk to you about that afterward okay
okay uh I've the high school I went to was uh was a good one also and I well I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools because the one I went to was you know I'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta yeah
yeah it was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system?
yeah yes that that was true for mine too uh although I I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity
but I don't think I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it you know I think that uh I mean I know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education
what and uh you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn yeah that's true I mean you know yeah and I'm also
I mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would you know in areas where they yeah yeah that's true but but uh I think I mean even more than that even I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know? which it I mean it sounds like uh uh huh
yeah that's true now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory tory tests if you have to take before you get a diploma
right but uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read
uh and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really I I I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen you know except maybe to someone who's you know really badly learning uh disabled or something
yeah but these people obviously weren't
that's hard for me to say since I didn't I didn't really grow
well when I went to elementary school it it wasn't in a great area but I still I mean I learned to read started learning to read when I was in kindergarten you know yeah
so I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed region yeah yeah
you know I guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people yeah and I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably I mean I don't I think you know people just
so I guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to uh to get some kind of motivation to learn and yeah and again I don't I mean they got to know the you know how qualified I mean I think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like uh huh yeah
uh huh I think that'd be an interesting experience but uh I haven't done that
no I I can't say that I have either
but uh but I do I do think that uh I mean public education in general I think can work and I think it's a good thing
yeah I've I've heard some I mean I've heard statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education I mean within like within the same uh income groups yeah
if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private schools yes
I think they compare you know fairly well yeah yeah I mean I don't I honestly don't really think I could have you know done much better than I did in the school system I was in I mean yeah
I I I my schools I mean there I have a lot of once once it seemed I got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that yeah
that I mean that makes a big difference cause I wondered when they're taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that yeah I mean and and in the
once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels well no I guess it in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects uh which
uh huh I mean actually I think that works pretty well and that that makes I'm nevin from sunnyvale california
hi this is jim bliss from minneapolis minnesota how you doing? pretty good
good uh I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it yep
uh I'm ready whenever you are okay
so uh what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there? well I definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous
yeah yeah I think that's probably a good thing it's probably the safest thing
yeah I mean it's to easy to get a quorum yep
and simple majority won't do no and even like you know two thirds majority I mean it's
yeah that's yeah quorums are to easy to get yep
and there's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason you know so it's it's yeah
definitely but uh I don't know I could I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing yeah like gives them a little too much power
yeah I I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently but uh plus you know you may be you know doing you know a a guilty verdict but it may not be you know it may be for technical reasons
yeah about the only good thing I would say about that is it that it would uh hurry the process up a bit yeah
but I mean even now we've got I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that and that's what the trial by jury I know
I mean jeez if if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances who's to say yeah it there would be much more of that
yeah no doubt are you involved in the legal system at all? no but I I tend to follow it just to just to know what's going on okay
yeah yeah I've got some friends that are lawyers so yeah I do too so
one of them just got his law degree but uh to tell you the truth I'm not real familiar with uh the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now no
I really haven't studied it in depth yeah I know a little more about civil cases when than criminal cases which is
yeah it's more in how you present it versus you know who's right
I'm sure of it because a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better yep
uh it's kind of weird I don't know you I always think about watching the people's court or something and how weird those cases get I know it's just when I was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and
yeah like you know you go say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're going to you know the opposition will say this this and this and
uh huh and it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is yep
it's pretty amazing and it's like the the truth isn't really important anymore it's
yeah it's not and then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because yep
like this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people
and so he'll he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case you know
it's like it is it's it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers money and everything else that sounds like a little abuse of our system but
but uh yeah but it's for the more general people don't want to take responsibility yeah you know it's
and and most of the time they're looking to place blame uh and stuff yep
see you're from california is that right? uh yeah well originally from chicago but
oh okay I was just thinking I wonder I wonder how how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in minneapolis I really from what I understand it's all pretty the same except when you get to louisiana
and louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the what is it it's based on common law and the rest of the country is not or something like that uh huh yeah
pretty strange but uh fortunately I never have had to go in even even for jury duty yeah I haven't either other than
but uh that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for uh as a witness he may subpoena me
so we'll see what happens but uh yeah I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better
yeah it's there are too many big problems you know there's there's such a backlog of court cases right now you know to try to get them all in in a good time I know
and we already have too many lawyers as it is yeah and if it's criminal cases we you can't put them in jail because there's no room left
yeah yeah that's true and in fact they're even letting some go yeah
I I I'm originally from florida and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them you know huh
that's not a that's not a good solution either not at all I'm not real sure what the
the last auto repair I had was I have a nineteen eighty four nissan truck I had a tune up done and I had I had the brakes done on it and then the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope and it has eight spark plugs and it's hard to to get get at them and plus the time on them I just don't have time any more uh as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself I I usually change the oil and wash the air filter and I I had an occasion to change to have to change the battery once but the brakes I was really surprised that the brakes I wanted I do have the background I know what needs to be done and I know that the oil needs should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings and the lube lubrication system needs to be lubricated and so I I stay on top of that but I I wanted my front wheels I wanted the bearings packed and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh a front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
just to pack the bearings? just to pack the bearings but what I found is that they had a brake job and they I had them the other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it see
right and they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so I just got the the brakes done and I thought that was a good deal and plus
right and they repacked the wheel bearings and they repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but uh I've I've had considerable experience I'm you might say I'm uh uh good back yard mechanic and I you know I took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but I I still have a pretty good feel for it but one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars I I had bigger cars and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those and what I was surprised at is that on my little nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand I have almost one hundred and ten so I drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them so those small little trucks and cars like that they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good
you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much and the the surface materials on the pads is so good exactly
so I you know I just did it anyway I like to I like to stay up on it you know like I just kind of stay up on it and then if you go and like just about any point any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say uh a white golden brown you know it's not dirty I I I keep it that way because that's that is the key to the longevity
right well it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that so so how uh huh
uh and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that oh oh
uh I I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and uh and in fact I have an eighty seven mustang with a three o two in it that I've uh beefed up a little bit uh huh uh huh okay
and one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels uh huh
uh the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were uh not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum you're talking about the vibration dampener?
well there's three there's three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and uh the water pump pulley that's the vibration dampener yeah okay
so when I changed those over I put on these these pressed aluminum things um
and uh probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out uh oh
so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way but not far enough to notice um uh oh huh
so I was on my way to work one day and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half
so there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank uh huh and uh I
well my exercise program consists of uh you know it's it's a opportunity to stay alive really instead of you know wasting my my the you know the trying to exist on the latency of my youth the good health of my youth
huh I'm and what I like to do is I like to stretch out and I like to run uh I'm I like to run get my heartbeat up I like to run about oh about two two and a half miles and then I like to work out on uh on the uh the bailey life cycle machines up here at the at the holiday spa and and I I think that you know I've had a regiment now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that and uh and I I kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work but I think it's uh it's a lot of work but I think it's uh it's the uh the amount of effort that's required to uh to stay healthy you know I have a sedentary job and uh unless you do something like that you're going to get sick
right yeah I'm I need to get I'm I'm pretty bad about that I'm lazy I should I know I want I always say that I need to get start running and I'm going to try and do that this summer because I never have time I I always put it off by the time I get back from classes it's late at night and I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever because I'm I'm getting a gut here I got to get back into shape well I uh two years ago I started having trouble with my knee and uh you know I've got you know I figured well it'll go away well I you know I'm I've had to reduce my program reduce my program and I've gained fifteen pounds
huh and so uh you know it's you know I need to get back into swimming you know instead of running if I can't swim or I can't run I should be able to swim well I'm such a terrible swimmer and I I I really feel I can I can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort but if it gets longer than that I I it I start not doing anything
yeah and so so I got a real problem in that regard uh it do you obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
yeah I mean I do it I guess I'm going to do it uh because I want to get in shape I'm not it's not something I really enjoy all that much that I'll I'll probably I mean once I get into it and I if I if I get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a a chore to me well it's it's always a chore I mean I started doing this when I was about thirty five yeah
huh and now I'm fifty five
yeah and uh you know I I know that in I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense you know some health related thing is going to blow me away that's the same way I got too much weight on right now I need to lose fifty pounds you know
right I need to lose at least twenty you know but uh you know it's it's just uh I'm busy I'm doing a lot of traveling and uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road what sort of uh uh what other programs other than say running? have you have you ever done anything at all?
yeah I have uh sit ups or also last summer I was doing nautilus or last year I'm uh belong to a club right here got kind of expensive uh to to renew they wanted another fifty dollars uh huh
that was a little bit too much money but uh doing a mix of nautilus and free weights I like that club what club are you with? I'm sorry? what club were you with?
it's called oh what was it called city sports downtown washington oh okay so you're you're down you're downtown
yeah I'm at I'm at I go to george washington university okay yeah you're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and f g yeah
it's uh plaza oh well I'd uh well there's a there's a holiday spa down there on on k street I think something like that but uh I I go to the holiday spa here in alexandria and that's pretty good but you know evening time it gets pretty busy but generally you know I can I can get in and get a program you know
right but uh you know I I need to I need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this and uh I got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it I mean I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
yeah and you know and I'm I know I'm going to get I know it's going to bite me in the ass and so I I really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it
yeah it's something I think uh I'm young I should get started getting into shape I don't want to I want I mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it well no when you're young you you can abuse your your all your systems and you can recover
yeah uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away and just wind up having to kiss your ass good bye you know huh and uh and so the object
steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or or or what do you think?
well that's that's a really hard question I do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths uh I let's example uh our friend the president right now says no new taxes we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases so uh I know the politicians uh aren't aren't straightforward now in terms of economics I'm not it's hard hard to call it really is uh huh see I never thought really it's uh I never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little I I always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment for instance like social security tax or uh I mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us
right so that's yeah you know when I when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week I or each every other week I I really think that money's history and you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing
yes uh and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in d c that are researching to find a cure for polio which I may be wrong but I believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in d c or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and and they just haven't yet
well yeah I'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio uh huh
I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio well that might be the difference I don't know uh the other thing that uh I remember seeing on t v lately is uh had to do with it's like seventy five percent of the historical sites in america are in the home districts of very powerful people politically
right that that for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians
yeah it's it's it's funny because uh it was one of the things that bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals uh huh
and the poor president has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing so it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto oh
I I think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the president uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste on the other hand uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president not to veto important things uh and just to get rid of the unimportant things yeah
and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the where the boundary between waste and and necessity is uh huh
so I'm not I'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems but there definitely is is a problem with uh I forgot there's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something yeah
uh pork barrel politics
pork barrel politics there has to be some way to do it I know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh I lived in massachusetts for a while and uh when dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular yeah but massachusetts wasn't when dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially
at least at the end uh huh I mean I don't know I
yeah they were very good at first they were in very good financials at first and uh that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well and then of course the bottom fell out it's uh I mean it's it's tough I mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot
and spare the economy yeah it's really it's a hard balance it it definitely is even not for government even just say for a small business uh I know some
uh I think uh actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation and for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit
right I think it's health care it's what I think everybody would say that
oh and if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg right belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you
right uh the uh sometimes I think it's more important than salary
uh do you also get dental? yes and uh I don't know if I would rank that second but uh since I have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important yeah you know
oh I know in a in a given year dental dental expenses can really kill you
now my husband is with uh northwest airlines and he gets uh you know the full health and dental and uh we have four children and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous right
and I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it right it's uh
or maybe they don't right uh and then uh uh if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will
that's right that's right uh I guess that would be up there uh I'm not sure if I would rank uh how I would rank that next to say compared to retirement or uh uh uh pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great a great benefit uh huh
right and I I think it's really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh germany and japan uh right
well it's a lot easier to to save it when you don't get your hands on it first right when you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldn't otherwise do right and
uh what about what about uh lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the corporation for example uh oh leave? yeah
do they even do they have father leaves or anything like that? you know I I don't think so yet they may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take
uh huh uh I their uh I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short uh
oh I do too uh uh I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks
oh I think I think it's just a crying shame uh for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks right and uh
she isn't recovered and uh the infant needs her desperately at that point and time there
there ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time uh huh
right I agree it's uh it's so important to families then and uh and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up oh sure uh especially in this day and age that
you don't want to start over again anywhere yeah you're right I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I that I would most like to see uh changed uh the uh parental leave
well I think they're at they're they've come a long way uh at least some companies some of them uh my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency right
and uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy and uh I just don't know how how women do it particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end uh right they do it by shortchanging their kids there's no other way I mean uh unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely uh that's right that's exactly right
right people moving as much and uh they just it's just a terrible choice you shouldn't have to make it uh huh uh you're right and uh
one of the benefits we get of course is travel oh right boy would I like to have that it's wonderful yeah
the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere but you can't afford to stay once you get there oh listen I have friends in a lot of different cities if you just fly me there I'll take care of that
that's right you have to have an awful lot of fun just just getting there is has to be half the fun right so and uh I guess the okay go ahead
uh well you know uh I think public service is a worthy thing and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs uh such as peace corps that promote that uh huh
probably the most popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts huh
uh I know that because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his eagle and uh in order to get eagle you have to have merit badges in uh citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world right
and you have to do a public service project uh in which leadership is the key element uh huh
I uh I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because uh it's talking about a requirement for public service uh huh
and of course the peace corps the boy scouts is a is a voluntary activity right
uh I I think that might be talking referring to uh something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know either you have uh military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years
right of course uh uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service right right
and so uh one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal uh qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft huh right right
uh but I agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended there are other things such as civil service uh which many people uh are lifelong employees of well uh huh right
but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either more of a voluntary kind of thing yeah
or uh yeah yeah for for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school
uh huh uh kind of in lieu of the draft for for people who don't uh who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want to be in the military you know say okay well you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and learn about things and it's interesting because I I'm not a particular fan of the military but I have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know even just personal discipline about what they want to do and they come out and they they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline and they have uh you know in in some cases they have a greater self esteem because they can say they can see that you know if I do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time I can accomplish a lot and it it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they don't need to be you know cowboys they don't need to be out there and uh you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
and you know for some for some young men that's good for me it would have been lousy idea uh because I I did have the personal discipline
why? and I went to college for four years and got out you know
why is that? so but uh you know for some people that's good I I don't particular like the fact that it's the military you know and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as as an instrument of u s policy
oh no no no it's to defend the nation against external evils well that's one view and and you know and that that's another debate but uh it's uh
well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military uh huh
right right and well it's it it seems pretty aggressive oriented I mean you you look at the last military action which was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states and it was uh you know it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe so at at any rate this is getting off the topic but my my point was that there is for people who don't want to do the military service there it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and uh sense of community that the boy scouts
bye so we're uh our discussion's about uh the care of the elderly?
that's right that's right you know what what uh what do you think is important? if you were uh I don't know how how old you are but if you had if you had uh parents say or or or grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for?
uh well I actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety and he lives by himself
huh and he's in good shape
yeah uh but uh some friends of mine have uh gone through this I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and uh where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive and where there was uh caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it
yeah do you have any experience with this yourself? huh
well my uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh minnesota uh huh
and we go there uh once a year we see we tend to see her there cause we're in boston so we're pretty far away when we visit minnesota though we go to see her uh huh
and it seems uh I mean the the environment there I don't know too much about it but it it seems nice enough uh it it's hard at least half of the residents I would say are not not mentally sound so it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to to retain uh clarity say uh you know from the lack of stimulation you mean
yeah well I I I don't know we we also my wife and I uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house we uh she goes more often than I we used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there and we'd take we have a two year old son and so we sometimes we'd take him with us and uh there I would say it's the same thing it's it's a nice uh relatively nice environment but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly uh certainly have are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on it's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see and see all these other people who really don't know where they are do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?
I think yeah I think they're relatively respectful yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be I I think sometimes you know I've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and but things that are not reasonable uh huh
and so at some level the the the uh yeah
I'm sure that the that the uh the staff learn what's normal for this person and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know yeah it it's possible I was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need oh yeah
yeah I'll tell you one thing though that'll that that I I saw that was really nice we saw a husband and wife we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were uh huh
and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house uh huh so it gives them a sense of identity and so
yeah you walked in there and it didn't look like uh you know how you you walk into some rooms and there's it's completely generic there's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it but this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like uh it must have been it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know uh yeah I I think part of what you're saying matches what I have read I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who uh were adequately deficient in their abilities uh physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves
yeah but I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide um a lot of social activities
huh yeah uh the one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation uh and
huh temporary I that that's that's new to me I well I think it I think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there right right and there there's so much how many children do you have now?
well I have five you have five?
right well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you?
well five are I mean four of them are grown they're in college or just out of college so I really have just a thirteen year old at home uh huh you sound so young
well I work at it all right to have them uh I try to fool everybody I think you're doing a good job I just have one child
uh huh and uh I don't think uh well there's not much I can do about it my my wife and I are in our forties you know so uh
uh huh but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the they're the pivot point of the universe
I think you are right because I was an only child too and that's one reason I have so many because I really I enjoy the big family yeah
and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters and so she is sort of like an only child and it's the same type of thing uh uh huh I have a younger brother like that I'm in my forties like I say and I have a brother in his twenties
uh huh and I was I was the youngest
yeah so I understand how that worked and he was treated like he had five fathers or something
right that's exactly how it is you know she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her when things don't go right she just calls one of them you know yeah
but uh yeah it it's a little bit difficult though I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more and did you all do a lot of organized things like uh little league uh soccer?
we we really did not my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion she twirls a baton and we did a lot of things together uh huh
she and I did a lot of things together and flew we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform uh huh
and that was a lot of fun but that that I guess you could consider that organized I mean there is a competition all the time yeah
we were very heavy into that other than that they were pretty much and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that you know I think that's probably true the if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities
uh huh and if you have a large number of children or then you don't
well you can't afford to no you and there's not enough time uh
right like my son is in uh little league this year he's ten and they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just uh if there were more than one child I don't know there would be no way to do it
right that's right you know one parent go one direction and I'd have to go in the other and we could only cover two at that uh huh
yeah well I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter and my little one also competed because really she had no choice she had to go with me uh huh
so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was it was making the friends and going all the places and it was a really neat experience but it took our total time I did not work uh when I did this now I do work full time uh huh and it's just my thirteen year old and myself
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other so I don't think although I think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me but I'm not sure I could afford three I most certainly couldn't educate three
I don't know how my my parents did it
yeah I mean there were five of us and I don't recall you know wanting anything in particular uh but I don't know how my father did it he worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children but we did okay we had a house and a home and but now my wife and I both work and we don't I don't believe we have as much as my parents did and we only have one child really? uh huh
well things cost a lot more I don't know how it is in georgia huh and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some atlanta is horrible
is it? yes we have a lot of people moving here from boston and and different areas and from talking to them they're shocked
really? and they you know the housing is so cheap in comparison to boston that they jump on it right
that's what I've heard they sell their house they stash away a good bit of money and come down here and I work with a lot of them they they think they they have really done something then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to to where they came from huh
yeah the housing is cheaper but that's about it I'm surprised to hear that I've heard very positive things about atlanta okay
so how serious is the subject of crime in your area?
well needless to say here in washington d c this is the war zone uh d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital
it's uh it's really bad here uh for example the uh local high school uh they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns
jeez and they're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things so
well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here uh huh
uh san jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime uh huh
uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the hispanic core uh huh uh huh
uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions uh huh right that's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups I guess and uh
yeah now the interestingly enough I don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few most of them centered around uh drug territory uh huh
uh huh and so they're protecting their economic interests I guess
yeah and uh nowadays the latest thing I've I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house
well that's efficient yeah that's the uh latest thing that way there's no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want
they're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort uh huh
right just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get in off they go with your car
wow so it's uh I think they call it car jacking around here
yeah yeah I'd heard that phrase uh huh yeah that's kind of the latest thing but every year in the d c area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so it's uh it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here we're from uh I'm from ohio and my wife's from florida so
uh huh and we've just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for for us to to have to put up with and it's uh really scary sometimes
yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays
right and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school
uh huh and uh of course the mayor uh of d c is having a real problem uh trying to what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like d c where it's a way of life for everybody it's uh I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem I don't know what what the solution is uh there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing
well uh there's a couple of things that I've heard
uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you'd have to do uh huh uh huh
uh course the the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just you know the the the end results of of poverty and and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else uh huh
because I mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything right
uh and they see all their friends and neighbors uh
and they're accidental parents half the time anyway yeah and their friends are driving mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh I think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised
it's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it right exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they they say well it's it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life
yeah so I don't know it's I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy
well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem uh uh huh
the the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away right
uh they've always been with us
I mean there's there's been a lot of uh and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else uh huh uh huh
uh and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow right think about this?
uh do you have children in school? I do
uh I have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college uh
but I also have two that are just entering school uh uh well I think they're just pushing them entirely to fast so you see a big difference then in before and now do you or a lot of testing?
uh well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade uh huh
my son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock uh huh
and I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner I do too I oh I think that's awful
and uh I have a preschooler uh I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten and I thought well how mature do you have to be I know what's the new criteria huh
and uh there is a do you have the standardized testing now? we have all kinds of testing and it's over and over it's I t b s or and uh just everything everything
yeah and they test test test I live in plano actually and I don't know if you've heard of plano but it's a very transient community
no a lot of people from everywhere it's just north of dallas
uh huh and it's grown in leaps and bounds I we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now
oh and most of them from other places
yeah uh j c penney's come down from new york and of course t I and xerox from rochester and we just have lots of people from everywhere lots of industry coming in yeah
and it's a very wealthy community uh not that I am but other people seem to be
and I would love to know why but I mean they do they have
you would like to know what they're doing right I I would I really would I mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes and they have everything the kids only wear name brand things to school and it's one of these things
oh me well that makes it hard for you doesn't it well it does you know it really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now and uh you know it does oh me
I mean we do it to a point but uh not to where she feels different
yeah but some of them are very rich
it's hard to explain to them why you can't and so uh we just kind of have everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are
right and so I don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is texas but the kids are expected to excel in everything
oh dear and it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first and they're expected to be
right you know their parents expect it the teachers expect it texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system
right and if you read national surveys they're far from it and so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests
how about the kids how are they coping with it? well not very well they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests huh right
I mean they make a big deal to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this
you know I just feel they do better that way
yeah rather than anticipating and
yeah and and I have older children too that now are out of high school and they've always done this here I mean it's always been the same but it is it's getting worse and worse is more pressure for everything and I just think it's really awful and I I'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but I think it's a very long day
oh it is and my feeling is that you know you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school that's right
my son said that came home and he said he said mom all we do is work uh huh uh huh we hardly ever play and and I don't think that's right I think we should do what europe does and include cultural activities in our school system
oh likewise I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano
right I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well rounded kids not just book smart kids wouldn't that be great uh huh
right and so I just find this a real problem I think if they're going to be there all day they should find time one of my daughters once was out of school with mono in her junior year I think it was and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead so what does that tell you? is that right? it tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time oh my gosh
oh my gosh and they could be using this time better
well for example in my son's kindergarten they're really finished at lunch time after lunch they have some uh I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch and then they have naps or rest period uh huh
and uh I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting that's a very long day for kindergartners I agree but I think that working parents have kind of demanded this
I wouldn't be surprised you know because they don't they don't want to send them to daycare I doubt if they would say it was too long that's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day
uh do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care? we have them at one school like
so how do you feel about it?
uh I I don't see any problem with with testing for random drugs yeah I I myself almost uh am in favor of it uh I work at honeywell and I went through a a pretty I don't know I went through a standard drug testing thing before I I was brought on
uh huh I think that's pretty standard at least at honeywell it is uh I think it's important to insure the quality and and uh I don't know almost the goodness of character you know that kind of thing yeah where do you work?
uh well I'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon oh okay oh okay
and I I just came from saint paul uh interviewing with three m huh oh great
and uh they have a policy for uh testing if you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start right
and I guess the only drawback I can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem uh huh yeah
but yeah and that that definitely happens you know I mean those the drug tests sure they're accurate but there's always that margin of error
yeah and that's that's something to be aware of another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that
yeah you know I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for honeywell and uh uh you know I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something uh I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
right uh I don't know what what program are you in over at carnegie mellon?
uh electrical engineering oh okay great uh yeah I'm a graduate student at u c f in florida university of central florida
oh wow and this is actually a an internship up here
but uh they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so
they test you uh before they before you start or before you even interview right
or uh they essentially no I sure don't uh they essentially uh they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer
uh huh and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
oh so uh there's some noise on this end I'm actually in a mall calling so
oh you probably wondered huh but
yeah what happens if you were to fail? then do they give you like one one more chance or two more chances? yes that's a good question I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail I believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
uh huh but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but uh are you working right now anywhere or uh no okay
I'm just about to finish my master's in may and uh just interviewing with companies right now oh okay great
yeah that was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there
uh huh and he's doing an internship with I b m
oh and uh they basically uh did the same exact thing uh we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh
did do they test you at right now at work too? no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job
okay uh I think I think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it
oh you know so that's good I guess I don't know I mean I uh I have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there uh you know smoking a joint or whatever
uh huh and uh you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know but no they don't they don't really do that so
wow is it formal policy that they said they might test? yeah
okay well uh I'll let you start I guess
well uh yeah I I'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing and I've got some very definite uh opinions about it uh you know which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it but uh developed a little more I guess but haven't changed that much what about you? are you uh involved at all? uh no I mean I'm not my employer does not do that uh although uh I had an ex employer that uh the previous job I used to have uh they after I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
yes uh I I don't know my feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb uh if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I I'd be willing to support that for example uh uh well uh uh train engineers
yeah because it you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an amtrak engineer you know
right he crashed and killed some people because he was uh smoking some marijuana and I guess air traffic controllers I wouldn't want them to be on drugs and airplane pilots but where it's not necessary uh in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh I I'd I would seriously question it yeah uh so
yeah yeah it uh that's that's mine it it you know I I go back it to me no matter how much the our company claims it's not a constitutional issue that because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government it's not the constitution doesn't apply but I it it seems to me that it still should I I our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor uh and so it's it's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts and I'd I'd so it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent?
yes okay and our company has taken that and gone all the way say okay uh first off we don't we don't have enough courage to uh pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage uh because that would offend them uh if they if they weren't so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even uh and and uh yeah well
then uh but and they so it's a a complete random testing well it's random in the sense that you don't know when it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested huh
uh and uh you know I I sit at a terminal and and write software all day it it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in in my job right and
and and uh yes I I agree that there are there are uh jobs that are definitely life threatening and and and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at reasonable and proper you know yeah yeah I agree I mean it's well there's also the issue of uh out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results or I shouldn't say high
well I mean several percent
yeah I that that I that I will give credit to to our our company for in that that I think there's there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh of drugs and essentially the first thing is is on the order of paper in the urine and uh or some you know it's not quite that simple but it's fairly simple kind of a coarse kind of test
coarse kind of test and then there's a a much more uh uh refined test uh uh spectrography or whatever it's called the chemotography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are is that done right
and uh now let me ask you this uh at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any
no I I've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now okay so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this and uh
no and it and it and it has it has you know they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody and I uh at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know but on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
so how do you uh so so it sounds like you've got a television going on there so I can assume that you probably watch the t v news is that
I almost never watch t v news really? wow I
I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio uh what what station do you listen to?
uh it's a local radio station it's called uh k l I f cliff cliff I see so uh it's not affiliated with anything is it not it's not a network station no
no okay yeah because I I listen to uh public radio a lot and they have they have k c r w which I I I saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable tv outlet I guess they're getting a little getting a little feisty now
well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news uh
and occasionally in the morning I'll pick up something like uh c n n or that but I hate watching the like ten o'clock news or yeah so you have a paper or something or
yeah we have a well we have uh dallas morning news which is the big paper in dallas uh huh
we read I read it pretty much from cover to cover yeah
how do you like it? it's been it's been a while since I read the dallas news I uh fact last time I read the dallas dallas news I was in arkansas I uh
the times herald went out of business here oh yeah? and so we really only have one dallas newspaper and one fort worth newspaper
well that must be pretty bad so how did that happen anyway?
uh financial trouble no not how I mean when did it when did they oh when did it happen? yeah
I guess they closed down about three months ago oh really um
so how do you keep up? oh me I uh good grief I read the times los angeles times there's quite a task if you've ever run into one they're uh
yes they're very voluminous yeah they're thick
uh if there's something you want to know it's it's in the times and then and in detail uh they uh we we used to have two papers here in town and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of oh I don't know just nobody was buying it really
so there really is only one major l a now? yeah pretty much uh there used to be fact I think there still is the uh the daily news which runs out of the san fernando valley
and uh they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes in fact it was kind of weird because I met the uh I met the I met the editor uh while I was on uh while I was doing jury service in santa monica one time it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff he was a really cool guy uh you know went to columbia university and all this stuff and uh it's it's a pretty good paper but uh you know it's not it's not the times
yeah although I you know I'm sorry to see some of their uh there's there's a daily news uh news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're they're expanding I guess but uh and occasionally I I pick up like time magazine or something I think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but you know it's I I don't have time
I used to read time magazine a lot but I don't read it much anymore yeah that's that's kind of a problem for them there's a lot of people who fall into that category
and then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the dallas morning news uh huh I see
yeah the big dailies don't like to don't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf I have to admit the times is kind of provincial too it's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover
now they have started here running a three day or three times a week plano section uh huh
and it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in plano but it's still not an awful lot of news yeah I know I uh it was it was a big discovery when when the times when the times found out there was a place called orange county
I mean the way they I mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the l a county border
oh I would imagine in uh you know in in dallas they have plenty happening in dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs and of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county oh really?
yeah yeah I I I find that attitude kind of arrogant though it's like you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us yeah
well we in in in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances uh the uh way back what twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer I did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all this kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it
uh huh that sounds about right you know so uh the only thing we're you know that we do now is uh I keep a a little spread sheet of uh what I call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth uh and I only update that oh I don't know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in you know just to see whether or not we're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what uh huh
right uh that's really about you know the extent of uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that we're doing uh
well it's kind of difficult for me because right now uh like most teachers I'm laid off and huh oh dear that's terrible
so um I spend most you know I substitute a lot uh huh
so it's a lot it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances uh huh
and but I know how much I have to bring in a month and that's about it that's about as far as we go and then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day uh huh
oh I see are you are you married? are you living with a bunch of with with people that you're sharing expenses?
uh no I'm a single mother I have three children oh I see uh huh
so uh right now we're on we get you know aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it and my ex husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support oh dear
so right now I know what I'm getting from the state and uh I have to balance more or less what I get from the state with my bills and uh you know try to work as many days as possible any time they call me in uh huh
but I still have to figure out if I work too many days then I lose all my state aid and if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills and it's like a juggling act every single month uh huh
like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation I see
so you know the four days before they only have a four day week uh huh
and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in oh I see
they don't like to be absent before a vacation oh sure
but we're shopping around as far as well I'm shopping around as far as trying to get uh that's why I'm doing this to get some extra money and uh getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts uh huh
my kids are in boy scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the boy scouts because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me so it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit but you know we do a lot of robbing peter to pay paul I guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle class americans are in uh huh yeah you're the first you know uh my next door neighbor just lost his job in a you know one of these uh
oh my lord his company went broke I mean went you know bankrupt actually it was a subsidiary of a of an outfit called u s shoe or something it was a computer subsidiary I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company
really but uh you know they just folded it up and uh uh told him to they took the top management and gave them jobs with the with the corporate uh at the corporate front office
uh huh and everybody else was sent packing
oh uh hang on one second I've got
sure uh somebody was knocking on my door here uh it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present I mean it sounds sounds terrible to say but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than most people probably might be in terms of keeping keeping score of input and output right
uh huh definitely do you have do you have a computer at home or uh yes we do and we try to uh huh
you know I keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in uh huh every single day I'm at the computer I see
and it's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet you know uh huh
yeah have you do you use a standard uh a standard spread sheet or I mean
uh let's see how about uh let's see about ten years ago uh what do you think was different ten years ago from now?
well I would say as far as social changes go uh I think families were more together they they did more things together uh huh
uh they ate dinner at the table together uh the parents usually took out time uh you know more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity uh huh
uh although I'm not a mother I I still think that uh a lot has changed since ten years ago uh what do you think about that? we
well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short
yeah uh but I do agree that uh generally it's society has sort of uh let's see rushed everything ahead
uh huh and uh I don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently but I think that has a lot to do with economic situation
yes what about like as far as uh social changes in the individual? do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago? uh
um it depends uh it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too uh huh uh I just
well how how old are you? I'm twenty eight
twenty eight okay I'm twenty three yeah
so there's maybe a five year gap between us yeah
so uh I just I think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed and that uh usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home huh yes
uh huh and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
do you think it's an economic necessity or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living? I think that's part of it too but I do think
I mean do you think people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs or no no I don't
no I don't think that but then there are a lot of people that that don't have that but that really do need to work uh huh
uh huh I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive and then there is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that uh they think is is surviving which is really more luxuries yeah uh huh okay
uh huh uh but I I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
so you think it's which group are you saying is the one trying? I'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
uh huh because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing uh middle class in this country I think that that's in my opinion the case uh huh
okay so I mean I have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
okay and then sometimes I I often uh find that maybe there's so many different things available to us a microwave a v c r a answering machine a you know a special a dishwasher uh a refrigerator and some of those items um for the for the uh uh huh
well I guess we're sticking more to social changes but uh people want all of that uh huh
and not all of those are necessities right so they're trying to it has become a necessity
uh anyway we're supposed to talk about recycling basically what what your personal opinion is on it uh this is this is really for a speech research project they're doing so uh I don't know florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it?
well they just kicked it off down here in in sarasota county oh they did?
uh they had been doing it they started first in sarasota city uh you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually uh huh yeah
and uh they've got these I don't know what if you're familiar with sarasota county at all not quite no
they've got these it's it's county wide program now uh huh
and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash plastic cans and glass and then uh paper uh huh okay okay
which in the paper it's just uh newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing you're supposed to put in there yeah okay
no slicks uh oh that's that's good let me ask you this do they require you to presort it?
yeah okay see that's something in minneapolis they're really strict on in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly but when I lived in orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there
uh huh and they'd just sort it out for you
yeah yeah it was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am so
yeah right well you know uh I talked to this girl who uh she's a an an acquaintance of mine and and she's involved with uh oh what is the name of that company it's not amway but it's the other big vitamin company? shaklee oh okay yeah
okay and uh and and she's just shaklee crazy you know because it's her business and everything
and uh you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they don't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything yeah
which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know right
I mean it's a little extra work uh huh
and uh it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in sarasota county is they've got it can yeah
okay you put your garbage in a garbage bag and you set it out by the curb right
if you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container uh or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb yeah you got to tie them up and everything
well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it's about a foot and a half deep and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long right
this is a little container uh huh
and then they have another one the same size that one's red then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods uh huh
and so like you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and and if you've got uh food containers or anything like that it's a big problem exactly it is you know a big hassle so not only do you
yeah yeah that's true I mean up here they give you one one of those containers and you put everything in it
uh huh so it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you it's like well you know if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to to put all your recyclables in that one place you know uh huh this is true so it's kind of a pain in the butt
this is true but uh I don't know that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know you have have those garbage people that make how every many make twenty thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting you know and and maybe come up with a better system
uh huh make it a little more convenient but
yeah they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here uh if you want to have a nice garbage can you know yeah
and it's on wheels and it's big oh you can actually rent those? yeah okay that's interesting yeah
yeah up here the the city provides them kind of like
I think in I think in the city they do but out here in the county you have to rent them oh okay
and they just add it on to your water bill or something so where exactly are you in terms of of like sarasota? are you north of sarasota or east east of sarasota okay
uh huh and sarasota is on the west coast? yeah okay like south of tampa right? yeah okay I'm
yeah about an hour about an hour south of tampa yeah that's okay
uh yeah well I listen to this talk radio station down here and it's really they I don't if you ever listen to talk radio but those guys they just kind of get into to stewing up trouble you know with the callers and things like that um occasionally yeah
but they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know and some of it sometimes it's serious and they have some good feedback and all that stuff and from listening to that I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with yeah
and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program the welfare program that's going on right now uh huh and it's like uh
uh I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't and uh I guess uh looking back on it I tend to think it was pretty uh mostly a mistake
uh huh on the other hand uh the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental uh decisions any one of which was sort of understandable at the time
uh huh and uh but on the whole I think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do how about you?
well I'm uh I I was just uh in high school I guess when it when it ended uh huh
ended up being I was in the last last lottery yeah
and I was glad it was over by then right
I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like yeah
you know we uh those people that I know I work with several that were over there and for some of them it was just kind of I don't know not so much a holiday I guess that's how they tend to talk about it but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come back and you know yeah
but that they weren't really allowed to do anything I uh to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway yeah it's funny tonight I was uh helping my kid with an essay on uh stalin
uh huh and I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how uh in world war two the personalties of stalin hitler and churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense
uh huh uh they're certainly all leaders and uh and uh with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them
yeah and I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions of the vietnam war that the uh people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it otherwise there'd be they'd get you someplace else
uh huh looking back it seems like that was only partly true that uh there might have been a better place to draw the line uh I guess you can I guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight uh brought the cold war to an end but I don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to uh call the bully out and beat him and I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward and uh we were wrong
uh huh but I uh you know the like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the accumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation where and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than uh committing uh committing to a completely and uh winning it whatever that would mean
yeah well I I I think we did I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh we weren't prepared for I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war yeah
uh I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war I mean they seemed like a valiant thing yeah
you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad yeah
and it was a it was a traditional the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is well you're not
but in in the vietnam war it seems like it was a a the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad and and uh you know the it's ambivalent yeah
even it seems like even the people you know had the south vietnamese the north vietnamese and of course the laotians and the cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved but what what about the domestic effects like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it uh possible and even popular to uh criticize the government and they that pendulum started to swing uh maybe even too far to the point where uh uh supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the vietnam war on yeah
yeah and that tradition is still I mean it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to this desert storm stuff may have uh killed it
yeah but I think that was one of the biggest that you know the uh the domestic unrest
I uh get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to all things considered on national public radio uh that is one of my big sources for current events information uh I really like that coverage my wife uh on the other hand is home most of the day and she watches a lot of the cable news network have you seen uh have you uh ever heard of all things considered?
no we don't have the uh national public radio in in my area uh huh
I can hear it at the uh uh oh the college town nearby when I'm in stillwater which is about an hour away but the f m signal doesn't reach this far uh huh
uh I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit it gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a european point of view or from the country of origin uh huh
uh I agree with you too on the uh uh the cable channel c n n and headline news uh I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why I rely on shortwave and and then the cable cable c n n uh huh
I'm uh interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it uh how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world uh compares with the american coverage of how do you think that uh the viewpoints differ?
I think a lot of it is just uh the fact that in the u s you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts or or it's not happening in your backyard uh huh
so it's it's more of a it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what's on shortwave it's b b c is uh oh I don't know the right word is is almost uh they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it uh huh
and it just they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions do you think then that uh the american media is presenting an opinion along with their facts?
uh very much so very much so and I I think a lot of it is uh especially t v news they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to uh oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it
I mean I you know I think it's important to interpret it but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to to do the interpreting uh huh which uh which approach do you find to be uh more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting?
oh I like the straight reporting uh and then I I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it it's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it uh huh
uh I always think it's humorous when when the president gives the state of the union and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
and a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they what they write into it uh huh
so I overall I think I would rather hear just straight reporting one of the things that I found interesting last year during the uh the gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh peter arnett who had stayed in iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available uh there was a there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely uh uh hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that you know this isn't a baby milk factory how could he say it was uh I I think that that to me showed that the americans were really getting used to having the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
yeah I I think people are people have that opinion they they want to sit down in front of the tv and uh or at a read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out okay
I say they uh probably the best things to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink they're innocent right I see a a good a good southern solution
yeah uh so uh how do you how do you feel? that's of course being facetious but uh huh you'd have to say that
uh I don't know the the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing
uh huh and seems to me that that's I think that's the way it's done now uh at least my understanding of the law which isn't very good
uh huh uh it seems to me that the judge does it and I I think that's probably all right in that they you know maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing uh huh
and I guess also what the system will absorb right
probably more tuned in to that possibly though on uh capital cases like maybe the death penalty uh huh
uh I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole I mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial that's right
but maybe uh and I think that may I that may be an exception as well because I think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge?
I I think that's I think that's the way it is yeah
uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh the accused or whatever would get the uh get the death penalty do they have a death penalty in california? yes in fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month yeah
uh huh and uh there's a big uproar going on right now uh
yeah the uh governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not
uh huh you know it's someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in san diego as a matter of fact
yeah I something like that I've got no problem with it uh yeah
I guess the way I think about it is not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge it's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people uh huh
put it to sleep you know just get it out you know it's not able to fit in you know something inexpensive
yeah yeah exactly uh I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just
if somebody gets the death penalty they're they're judged guilty they got the death penalty they should have one year and one appeal cover all their bases with one appeal and if not you know don't don't let them sit up there on death row for you know fifteen years yeah I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years
uh huh yeah that but I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those yeah oh I'm sure
yeah the other thing they asked about was whether uh uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again I think is the way it is now that all the all verdicts
uh huh well maybe not I don't know at least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous I believe it is in capital
I think in like uh lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever how ever many is on sitting on a jury uh huh
I I believe that's the way it is but I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases uh yeah the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial and that there's one juror that is is uh different than the other eleven uh huh
yeah and uh they've only deliberated four hours or something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked
oh no and the judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet
I'm telling you go one way or the other that that's probably an expensive trial uh yeah six months so far they said yeah probably so
yeah probably you know I'm not sure there's a number it's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know worth of all the free for all maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote
yeah yeah that's that's been so long I've practically forgot who noriega was you know right
that has been going on my uh cousin is a f b I agent down in miami oh really?
yeah so she follows that stuff pretty closely but uh that's interesting
yeah she's not involved in that that case but she does well have you ever served on a jury?
no I haven't I never have my wife has but I I haven't uh huh I got called but I uh never uh got selected for a jury
uh huh I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process uh huh
and they had some guy that was uh defending himself uh huh
and you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue?
uh yes I do as far as uh as far as uh as far as immigration as a whole goes uh huh
I think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world uh huh
uh I there just is not going to be room for all of us we don't have jobs now I I think uh I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time uh I hope you're one of the employed right now uh huh I am one of the unemployed right now
I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company and uh I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications yeah
and I know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you know doing my line of work uh huh
and of course I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job right
so how do you feel? well I'm a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in in terms of what uh really is driving it they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with uh issues of uh race and things like that I mean right now uh I believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually one is at the high end uh they always want to be able to uh do some brain draining they always like to be able to attract the uh einsteins or the professor chou or you know
right they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that at the bottom end they uh are always willing to uh let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area
those are two things that I think are going on although they I I don't think the politicians would tell you that
okay and I think you're right in both cases and then the third thing is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in mexico
they can not close off the mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country
so they keep allowing uh the pressure cooker to let off steam
and I think probably it's pretty important right there how do you feel about haitian immigration? uh that's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with pat buchanan I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into uh society they're very difficult uh group to find jobs and uh and uh places for and so uh uh I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are but I'm not to sympathetic about uh letting large numbers of haitians in
actually actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here yeah
and it would have nothing to do with political situations it would have to do with poverty right but if you let them yeah if you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but politically and economically oh my gosh
have you been have you been to southern florida? yeah well I know about it uh I mean it's it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans uh twenty years ago
well I mean and the two of them together I mean we can it's just as well you know it's hardly america anymore on the other hand you know the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than our first generation immigrant so there's uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
but there's some differences in the immigrants that that we're getting now
well I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration right sure
I think probably your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals right
but uh the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into america
uh they they don't bother to learn our language and uh first of all they I'm sorry this I really feel strongly about this uh huh
we send a lot of money to mexico uh huh not very good it's not been a good day
I went I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon I don't know I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with carolyn so I hope she's turned it in
are you eating? uh I go ahead I'll stop eating I just barely got home from the university no it's say what? I just barely got home from the university
tell you what we can do is uh I can punch the uh one
and then after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want okay go ahead fire away
uh I love the irony of uh talking about this subject on april the fifteenth
but uh I'm afraid I'm I'm probably in the minority I I actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country uh uh particularly uh in this part of the country I agree with you
uh I guess I do have a a bone to pick with uh uh the way taxes are distributed uh I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form huh
and the sales tax can't I think that's regressive and uh uh it's kind of dumb I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax but on the other hand I don't mind that it's only on you know things that aren't like groceries and that it's not on that
well I mean nobody taxes groceries oh yeah they do where? in arizona is that right? uh huh
but we have a pretty low income I mean pretty low tax rate here oh I think the the sales tax they just got to do something about it
right but that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
right but I guess when I hear when I see the comparison between the united states and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty one forty two and ours are like thirty six thirty seven you know if you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are well and I still think that having lived in europe for awhile you know difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it yeah
uh huh I'm I'm not sure I understand what you mean well I mean I think I was in germany you know for several years
right and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there
oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher taxes yeah higher taxes yeah
I suppose that's true yeah uh probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever but still's that way to some extent
yeah I think the other problem is you know it it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you theoretically can do something about
right but I look for example and you're not quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world
right I wish I didn't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes right
yeah yeah since uh I send my kids to parochial school that yeah that that's probably a little tougher on you
it's not it's not quite the bargain that
but I mean I pay them gladly that's a decision I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money but uh I mean that's that's the way americans want to interpret it I guess that's all right but yeah I
and if I were uh when I was single and again when I'm retired I will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good
that's always been a high priority no I think that's just you though
I do yeah that's true I think in places I think in places like california people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the uh uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are uh just looking for fun people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens yeah
and uh there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done
that seems a a like a cultural lapse I mean people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they of course I think with the graying of america we're going to see that problem in lots of places
right yeah people would rather uh increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them but I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted or build roads yeah well
yeah I guess uh uh it's an easy one for me I think that's uh there's something seriously wrong yeah
what is it that you are you know particularly upset about? uh I guess uh I think they've lost their compass and uh I'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore but uh I voted with my feet and uh my kids go to parochial school uh huh so uh
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in a the public school system? well one hundred percent of the uh customers care that's one thing everybody cares about the education the kids are getting and uh they uh take an active relatively active part which uh I mean if you're uh sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on and you uh uh pay attention and participate and and you can influence the way things are
so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of uh real estate or other taxes and and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen? yeah the immediacy just isn't there
uh huh and uh uh I also think that one of the problems and actually I don't think this I think this is a cultural problem the uh problem with public education is really uh really a problem with the culture and I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed uh people are uh reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh they don't have kids in the schools
right I think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of uh uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids I think that's uh that's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it as uh as their problem and there's an immediate problem
right it troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that uh you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level right yeah
uh it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision yeah
you know I I believe that the original idea of public education in the united states which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution uh you know it barely made it I think it was added afterwards I think the real the principal was uh education for civic participation
right the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes
right it has taken on a more profound and you'd think we'd notice it economic uh thrust yeah well that's exactly what I was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization I mean and I think that one
well I'm glad that you added that one yeah I think that one's significant that's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor and then I quit and got disabused of that notion but uh the uh uh now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is uh an economic enterprise to train people for jobs and uh I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and I'm really sad to say this I never thought I would have but I really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem and uh that's why I guess I'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs
right well I I agree with everything that you've said so far and the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact I think with public school teachers than perhaps you are uh except as a parent of your child and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related right that's what like consumer
well have you ever served on a jury?
no I've not I've been called but I had to beg off from the duty and you? well I was called and then I was not chosen
um well I was I was uh originally chosen primarily I think because I was a young fellow and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict I don't know why something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago oh really?
yeah it's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason and they kind of liked me I looked and all that stuff and they I don't know what they saw in me but they saw it but uh back to the issue is uh I don't know at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun but there too there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly I think in civil cases in criminal cases I'd like to see the unanimity remain but in civil cases I think a majority rule by by jury would be sufficient well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that?
well in a criminal case say one in which you know there is like say assault or some such I think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this and in civil law there you know is such a thing as like let's say uh misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that a majority rule I think would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases I don't know if I'm making any sense or not well I mean I think are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more uh tangible or
yeah often there's more incriminating evidence like for instance say uh and also too I think I'm I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious in a criminal case well do you think that that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up?
um well I really can't say for certain truth be known uh as it stands there's there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a civil uh civil and criminal case I mean the uh documentary the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that you know I don't know for if you're familiar with that or not no I'm not
a uh fellow when he was much younger uh was tried and convicted and sentenced to death fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked and uh so he served out his his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system the case was reopened and he was exonerated well I mean I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served
yeah many laws but little justice say but uh and I also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that uh the just the process of picking jurors is not always objective
oh certainly not certainly not and you know they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers desires you know the because you get up and and they ask you a few questions both sides do and then you you're either challenged which is you know each attorney can use that as much as they like or I think it's a limit now they probably have a limit now but they pretty much go through that and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve for me it was financial hardship so but onto the thing uh I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing it was always my impression that the justice himself or herself had the final say
so let's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it what do you think? is pennsylvania kind of out of line there?
well actually I don't think they're out of line devil's advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether or not you agree with that law you're still circumventing it you are legal in in your circumvention of that law what what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying uh income tax on something that you purchase mail order?
really I I I don't think that's a valid argument I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax um naturally some some things you just can't find in your local k mart or or uh bryn mawr stereo dealer uh but then why not pay pay the sales tax corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax? well I mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when I purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania it's because I'm sorry the commonwealth of pennsylvania
yes uh it's because I I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so I go outside the area for that and I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state I don't I don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer
I I'll agree it it's not your responsibility but is it also legal for you to do that?
from what I understand from various net readings it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes uh in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that do your arguments still apply? well I think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then I don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh I bought this out of state I need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania
which is exactly what businesses do at the present right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer
and I I I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it uh
that's my understanding of the way uh the way it works usually the the person ordering doesn't pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay and there there are some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax? or purchasing
no businesses uh if purchasing things mail order
if if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these this great deal on forty six mother boards uh from from say utah um I I might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax my accounting department will at the end of the month I think that I think that's the way things work in pennsylvania and I know they work that way in uh say here in d c yeah see I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't I never see that end of the business
yeah so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer uh but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that uh the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided
that's true a a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh I I forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a a loss I I think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost uh I mean I I don't know if I agree with that but it but
yeah jonathan uh you you say it's near and dear to your heart buying a car is uh something you're contemplating I take it uh fantasizing about uh
can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family uh huh
and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago uh
it's got a uh five year loan so that's still got a couple years to run uh huh
and the car I get to drive is a uh nissan sentra that's going to be ten years old next month so I think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years if I can wow they get
uh huh what do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next?
well since I just turned forty I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car something uh something real sporty uh huh
but uh realistically with uh the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat uh huh
something a little seating room how about you? well I think the next car we get will probably be a well I I like buicks we have a buick century now it's a nineteen eighty seven
uh huh and uh whatever I get I want to have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over so I think the four door is probably a major requirement
sure and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car uh you know I'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh
sure something that will carry it around careful I guess is best best way to describe it right now we've got a v six and it that seems to be just fine I know they they're coming out with some v eight now and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age
yeah I was surprised to hear that the v eights are coming back so they've got some pretty powerful sixes uh huh
and uh you know v eights seem to be a return to the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon right I uh I drive a a truck a ford truck I I like trucks because they're spacious and it's handy to haul things uh it's not related to my business I just really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one sure
is uh traction much of an issue for you up there traction?
uh not really uh you know it's a two wheel drive truck and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway
actually uh pretty good way of looking at it yeah we uh we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago wow
a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that uh huh
haven't had any problems since what kind of what make is the mini van? it's a mazda mazda I see
and uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh driveability fuel economy isn't great being a mini van but uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around right
so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon one of my sons has a a plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the voyager I guess uh huh
right and uh they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends I'm sure that will be even handier so I know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
yeah I think that we're going to be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway what about uh all wheel drive? is that something that you'd be interested in or is that
uh I'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the sentra uh huh
and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter uh huh
uh again like you if conditions are are that bad I probably don't want to be driving anyway right
so I know I'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door you know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
actually to tell you the truth I think uh jury selection is a uh prime uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh uh finding of uh guilt
uh I certainly can't argue with that definitely does need some improvements uh
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to yeah I think there's a limit on that the uh the uh peremptory challenges are limited to I don't know how many I think it's four or five but you can
I can't remember which I was on a jury trial last year only I got kicked out as uh the last selection that the uh defense got um yeah it seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things I think I have a severe demeanor or something um uh
that uh but typically you know uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process and I suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who is well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice
right but it still has to be a group of your peers right see so
so if it's your peers and you're not educated then so if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd you'd have to have nincompoops to uh
you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them um
so that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant uh huh
so uh I think the jury selection process is pretty neat but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards um
I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have you're talking about the person's already been found guilty right uh huh uh huh
and many times I've seen on trials they have on t v the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but I think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be um
maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system uh huh uh huh uh huh
uh and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure well I suppose you may be right on that
matter of fact I've heard that I've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury oh is it? oh I didn't realize that okay
at least in california they're supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background right
but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down I think that uh that they should uh huh
I don't I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring uh huh so you what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them
well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time um
so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing I'm all for that for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets
I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are oh really? yeah like what? well uh say embezzlement right
you get a guy down the street who comes up uh carrying a
okay so what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care?
I guess I think uh I wonder if that worked does it say something?
I think it usually does you might try uh I don't know hold it down a little longer and see if it uh okay well does it usually make a recording or okay I well I don't remember
it seemed like it did but it might not I guess I guess we can start uh okay okay
no I don't I don't have any kids I uh my sister has a she just had a baby he's about five months old and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different uh huh do you have kids? I have three oh really? uh huh
yeah I do yes uh I don't work though but I used to work and when I had two children
uh huh I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care
yeah but does your sister live in a big community?
uh yeah she lives it's a it's a fairly large community she uh got real lucky though he had a boss who uh moved into a larger office uh huh
and she's able to take her baby to work with her oh really?
and it's a small office that she works in uh huh
and uh it's a it's a legal firm office and it's just one lawyer um
and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office there's no one else that works there uh huh
and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby so it works out pretty good for her wow
how lucky I I know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids
yeah and but the community I'm in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that you know you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to
yeah so it's fairly safe yeah to get references and that so but uh I I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because there's so many kids and so many
worried that they're not going to get enough attention? yeah and uh you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things
yeah but and they're expensive and course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things
yes or they just watch them and let them play and things like that but take a long time to find the right place
yeah and you and you don't always even know if it's it's going to be the right place or not uh huh
anything I guess could happen uh huh
because after I guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care uh huh when he starts toddling around and stuff yeah yeah
when when he's not when she can't keep control of him and he starts crawling that's uh huh it would be hard I think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around
uh huh but uh seems like you know what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or you know at the wrong time yeah but
I think she has problems with that too uh huh well when you have kids will you work? do you work now? I don't know
that's something I've considered uh uh huh
I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time uh huh
is that what you do? uh yeah actually I teach my kids at home so I'm here all the time
oh so they don't go to school is it like uh oh what's that called it's uh correspondence school they do it at home uh huh yeah yeah that's interesting so
do you have to have any special training? not it depends on the state you live actually some laws absolutely prohibit it some states uh say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet say that and I'm not a certified teacher I went to college but I you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now and so
so they haven't been to public schools at all one of them was for a couple of years and so you know my oldest he was and then my youngest two have never been um so anyway but we don't so you've never had
okay so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
uh not too bad really uh I had a razor that I got from christmas that I just I really didn't want it but I got it anyway and uh it was a braun and they were real good about taking it back it wasn't a problem at all so uh I was able to get that back pretty easily uh huh
but uh I don't know I really haven't returned a whole lot lately have you? I haven't had to it's uh the every so often I mean I I I'm almost pushing it myself maybe I'll buy a shirt from g I joe's and it shrinks too much and say well I should have known better I mean I bought it from g I joe's
um and it was probably made in china by slaves
right but uh they uh most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway I get pretty good stuff
yeah I think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized
right like and if you want to buy american it takes real extra work to find
exactly it's probably a japanese or a burmese company owning and hiring people in the u s I was reading
right I was reading something in uh consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out and about how yeah you'd like to buy an american car maybe uh huh
but uh you know the transmission may be made in japan or whatever yeah
uh like I've got an eighty six ford ranger and and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi huh
you know so it's like what are you going to do you know? yeah really
but uh that's the way it is I don't know I I personally feel that uh uh if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them you know that's the way it goes and you know people more than manufacturers should get a clue and you know they should start making quality products yeah I think they're beginning to the the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away and
that's what I thought too until I saw the consumer reports issue uh huh
uh they've got all the american well all the all the cars rated you know and uh essentially I I don't see much of a trend I mean just like every other time that you look at it the honda accords and the civics are right up there there's nothing wrong with them uh and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy and they're pieces of junk I know still at it hey
yeah that's ninety that's eighty six through ninety one wow
but uh I don't know maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue uh well they got a three year lead time it probably won't start really showing up until ninety four or so
yeah that's just it technology that comes in right now is is probably not going to be implemented until you know quite a few years down the road but uh the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer
oh yeah yeah because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time and can you think of any other industry where in software they
uh if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail
yeah or uh maybe I say well you know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade yeah
it uh they keep up with it pretty quickly and that's that's a real good thing I guess yeah
uh I don't know and the hardware well I mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the macintosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I b m and the rest of the d o s world to follow along yeah
right they're kind of the leaders right now you know I used to see all those commercials for windows you know and you're like oh gee they're reselling a macintosh under a different name
really why don't they just say almost a mac for half the price
yeah you know they'd sell more if they were honest
exactly almost is the key word there too you know because I I really I've used both and I really don't see an advantage of windows at all yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure d o s base uh yeah yeah that's true too
but uh I don't know I'm really I've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home I I do use a mac at work but uh uh I really don't don't do much with it at home uh huh
but uh apple's sort of making a and they're ones were growling consumer uh need to worry about the mac they're getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive right
uh huh yeah you sound like you must uh work in the computer business yeah I have one I do desktop publishing at work and I have a machine at home and I belong to the user's group and I I've been a mac fanatic since they came out
yeah? all right but uh technically I'm not actually in the industry I don't work a computer company no? I'm an abuser
well that's that's all right but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen yeah that's true
something that I find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let let's take the example the modem for you know yeah
okay what baud rate do you get? well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred well actually uh
I I don't think I'm in the uh majority of in in texas I don't think I agree with oh really no
you don't believe in it? uh I wouldn't say that I think I would have said that a few years ago
when I was younger I thought it was uh a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment but um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion
yeah I'm not thoroughly opposed to it I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought
you sound a lot like a friend of mine a a girl I hang out with uh huh
she has very very black and white opinions you know there's no gray in her opinions you know she she probably would agree more with you but but I don't know I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again I've never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family uh huh
but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done yeah
and we see that more and more like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl uh huh
you know that's fourteen years old what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult yeah I certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose
yeah I'm not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail but uh
no it doesn't but it costs less yeah that that's a factor
and yeah to me it is I mean I work and I pay my taxes and I lived out in texas for a little while and they're and that's a pretty heavy state compared to georgia I mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in georgia right
but even in georgia that's the attitude for the most part if I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine uh huh yeah
but when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore yeah
yeah well I the cost is something but it's but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime
and I guess I would like I don't know the european countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment and they they don't have a crime problem either
oh really no you can't they don't execute anybody in britain or france and I don't believe they do in germany or italy either and they don't have the crime problems we do I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
yeah I guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when I see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty I think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing and the that that bothers me
you might be right but it but uh
I mean I I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know
I would never in a million years want that job huh
but I do believe it's necessary and I yeah
on the one hand I I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing huh
and I couldn't pull the switch but uh well actually I the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it uh I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else I think it just becomes a uh symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians so
yeah I would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh
right like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country
uh huh now I'm I'm not so sure of that I'm I I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
what what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing?
uh I guess I'm I'm my view of uh my I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh that uh uh costs and other factors justify uh uh executing people
yeah maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that uh uh than anything else and uh I've also never been a victim although I have some I have two friends whose wives were murdered and uh I can imagine that uh uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case oh gosh
oh yes if it ever touched my
before the one will take uh okay let's see I guess uh I can start I'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing
are you really? yeah uh so I'm looking at uh something larger than what we have we've got like an eighty four charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty nine horizon so I'm looking for something uh littler bigger
uh huh which are both kind of small yeah uh so we were thinking mini van for a while and uh we're looking at uh some just four door five passenger sedans as well uh huh
are you looking for an american car or you open to buying foreign cars? uh I don't really have a preference either way I guess you know
uh huh it's you know it I guess the american cars had a bad reputation but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had uh huh right
personally I have a japanese car right now and I really like it a lot uh I think the japanese really build good cars uh huh
and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh you know buy american keep american auto workers working right now but I feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while yeah
if I were to buy another car I would be uh I would be partial to buying another japanese car but I would also look at american cars but when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also and I just felt that the japanese car was a much better product yeah I mean even if it's just details it seems like uh they you know so if I were
right I there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while it's clearly just a a design problem there
right it is uh I'm kind of right now the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car I would really like to have a sports car uh I don't really I don't have a family so I don't need a a mini van or such to uh haul people around in uh huh
so I'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh oh like a miata or something like that?
well I like the miata but I don't like it enough to buy it I would buy something actually the the car that I really like right now is an eagle talon which is an american car um
but uh something along that lines interesting
uh because I have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh I think I I'd like to move on to something a little better yeah
that's interesting yeah I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for you know size and safety and then mileage right probably right uh
that's when I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage and I was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time I was that I would get a for the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was that was worth that money yeah
so yeah I I think in terms of computer terminology I look at you know price performance and things like that and then a little bit at life expectancy I guess
right exactly but it you know depends on what you what you pay initially
yeah but you know I've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the charger that's right actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
uh huh and she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton
uh huh it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but uh the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it uh huh so but uh okay
uh I've had uh I've had one or two american cars I think and and they were okay I had a pontiac once and and I never had a problem with it but uh my mother had a dodge at one point and I I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that it that I would buy a dodge just from um
well actually I had a uh a dodge omni at one point uh huh
and that was I think what really prejudiced me against american cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality uh car yeah
so I guess you'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car that's interesting but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the uh like I guess in particular we're looking at a like a ninety one corsica uh buy back at a they say g m sponsored auction but I think they're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to g m after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it uh huh right
and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you
which is a good deal yeah because I guess uh I mean well ninety twos granted but the new ones you know
uh huh fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot
right so all the depreciation has been taken off and the dealer comes out okay you know
yeah that I don't know what kind of I don't know what g m corporate kind of hit the I don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it and so but uh I don't know
yeah I'm sure they did we keep looking at that mini van it's just you know we can get a like a caravan for at twelve five uh huh
right but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now but uh uh it's interesting but uh I don't know if if uh it seems to be oh so
okay I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so well it let's put it this way we've got the new england patriots up here so
oh yeah right well they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years really? yeah
why? um well uh partly due to ownership you know uh victor kiam owned the uh the patriots uh for a period of a number of years
uh huh and he always had this uh this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something and uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth and it recently was sold to uh some other people so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the patriots in the new england area anyways
yeah well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you oh yeah
I've been to a couple I've been to a few games before uh huh now you you're you're from texas
right so you've got two football teams down there
well it depends on where you're from in texas I live right by dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned uh huh oh I see
that's how it is there's that type of segregation huh? it's divided yeah wow
it really is so we've got our cowboys here and and uh I don't think anybody roots differently uh huh but I have a boyfriend that lives in fresno do you
and he is for the l the uh raiders l a raiders uh huh so do you follow professional sports at all?
well I just started to this year because of these silly raiders that didn't do very well
but I've been trying more this year I think I know a little more than I use to yeah
I never knew very much at all so I'm trying well it's a good past time you know
yeah particularly football they say uh football attracts more men because of the you know the you see the the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that uh that uh men take out their frustrations by watching football and you know they get together with a bunch of guys and they uh uh and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the uh the male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts I guess or something about the uh
so I shouldn't even try to do it huh? well no it it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest
yes I think that uh I personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport it has the speed
right and the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey not everybody can play hockey
yeah so we and that's we're a big hockey area up here I bet up here in new england as well as you know in in the minnesota area really but I don't even think we have that in texas what hockey? we might do we?
I mean no you probably know I don't know no there's no hockey there's no
nobody talks about it so I don't think we do there's no professional hockey teams in in texas
no uh huh and we have a soccer team that comes and goes we don't even have that very much so yeah I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now
uh huh like they have this world football league you see we have the n f l that that dallas and houston are in and new england patriots and l a raiders and those teams
yeah there are those teams that play in professional national football league but uh now they have what's called the world football league and they have all these teams from there's a team in london and there's a team there there's uh teams other european teams
oh and there's teams in the united states and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really you know overkill
oh yeah and there's only so much football you can watch
yeah well I like to do I don't like to watch yeah that's good I don't like to watch anything so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff I think it's an excuse to do nothing
and I I can see what you're saying about the male bonding and the guys get together yeah
and that's kind of cool that's fun you know uh huh
but it can get really overdone now have you ever been to a professional football game? yeah I have have you?
yeah yeah I have did you do the whole big the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole
uh no actually no well see now see that's what you got to do see now we talked our
I've done that for college football yeah yeah
yeah you the well the same thing
yeah we we talked our wives there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games and uh we talked our wives into going with us one time and they had a real good time and it was basically for the social atmosphere
right and that's the thing you know you go you know three or four hours before the game you go set up we set a table up we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more yeah
but but that whole it it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself but it's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game
yeah that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with with a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know
that's right you you miss that
yeah that's right and and any professional sport I think you miss that
uh huh the atmosphere of being there you know
yeah well in high school I went to every football game and well I twirled you know yep
and I you know I didn't I still don't know that much about football obviously but I still had a good time you know well you want to go first?
no you can start okay uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we what do we think about a judge making the decision?
uh huh and I really don't agree with that I think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time
right you know what I mean?
right there's there this topic is kind of mute uh yeah
there there's no way we we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury right
uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case that's it
uh every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult uh well I I feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could could it you you know change the system I I really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal
I mean if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question
right it's beyond a reasonable doubt you know all these things I mean you know we've gone through this over and over again
right they shouldn't allow an appeal and it can go on for ten twenty years
yep I I think this is a little ridiculous
uh huh I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers
oh that's right I work for a law firm I I'm serious and I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining right you know if someone is ill
well plea plea bargaining is a different story well
plea bargaining is something completely different that that actually prevents trials or at least speeds them up well I know that's what I'm saying but I think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard I mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they I don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences
right and I understand that the jails are full of people you know uh and that they have to do something
right but I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
huh you know what I'm saying? that we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment
right and uh I I think they should
we do I and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and uh you know all
right they they're caught dead to rights I I just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life
right when you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned yeah
we just have the case I'm I'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry uh huh
uh his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up oh really
so I mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession it uh yeah
but uh that was absurd there is never there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence I know that that
uh huh and I don't know uh what would you do to change it? to make it better?
well uh the the only I can I you know the appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of uh like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd there's no way that could work oh yeah I I I don't agree with that at all
uh but imagine the guilt that person would have I mean burned out
oh exactly there's there's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself exactly
right if you had to do something like that day after day
no one would want the job no not really
uh and you know like I said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case well do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like
oh yeah I I feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury that that that right I mean supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you
well I mean were there witnesses? in other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were right
right that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case yeah
I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place yeah
and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances well I I
uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job and how do you feel about them?
uh pretty good actually I work for hewlett packard and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package in fact they're they're kind of known uh for having good benefits the pay isn't fabulous although I saw a survey recently and I'm actually making just about as much as you know I'm making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me oh that's good uh huh what kind of a degree have you got?
I've got a bachelor's in electrical engineering so oh
and I'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff uh huh
uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good we've got stock purchase program and a that that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain uh huh
but uh there's a four o one k plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income uh huh uh huh
uh there's how long have you been with them?
I've been with them for seven years uh yeah that's good
and the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything uh huh
so uh it's not but there's full uh there's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything I don't get sick that often so I don't pay much of it and I pay five dollars every time I visit the the hospital that you know for a checkup or whatever uh huh uh huh
uh they don't cover eyes though and I I have contact lenses so that's kind of a pain uh huh
but you know I I can live but for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered
oh yeah yeah so that you've got small small things to gripe about right wow
and well that sounds like you must feel really good about it
yeah yeah and and the dental plan is fabulous the dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because uh wow
I I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that uh huh
but that's not the case uh huh
so I guess nothing it's fabulous wow
uh the what about you? well I uh work in washington at the naval research laboratory I also have a part time job at a law firm and I get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does uh huh
uh and benefits through the government are uh really uh they just uh they're not the greatest uh I before I I uh uh got my degree
uh I'm uh a computer scientist
uh huh and before I got my degree I had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in washington
uh huh and uh at that time I was in gravy city uh the law firms in this town are not you know for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties
yeah and uh benefits were just amazing
uh huh and we had everything paid for and uh anyway with the government it's not uh quite that nice a deal uh but it's you know it's it's okay what we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our uh uh our costs and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet and uh so I I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good plan at this point uh but uh it could be better that's for sure and uh but you know there are other things that you get when you work for the government uh in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere
yeah it's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where I don't have to uh uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that and so I'm I'm really kind of happy about that end of of things it's uh
yeah one of the things with my company is that they've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security and uh there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the san francisco bay area that they do uh huh
so there's I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company uh huh
and it's and I and I haven't had to move my residence to do that you know I still live in san jose and wow that's fabulous
yeah it you see now that's that's interesting because I have a cousin whose husband works for hewlett packard up in the massachusetts area oh yeah? yeah he he lives in andover
uh huh and uh the work that he he's uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the hewlett packard machines that do uh uh sonographic imagining
right right and uh I've been over to see his complex over there and it's amazing
uh huh it's it's all ecologically designed and and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up yeah yeah and
in fact I know a guy who works at andover who used to work who I used to work with out here uh huh
and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position kind of interesting uh anyhow
uh well having sort of the reason we're going through the school system I seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing I'm I'm just graduating graduating from college uh I didn't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system however when you compare it to school systems like they have in japan and you can compare just about thing to japan and we look like we don't have anything uh it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough uh however I if it weren't for our needless uh competition with japan I I'd I'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace I don't know uh I haven't it's been uh well seventy nine since I was at school at high school
uh huh and uh I've seen things change I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually because I wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare you know what I mean?
right but uh it seems like when I I lived in chicago I I've lived down here I hear the dropout rates from the schools and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year
yeah and I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth
huh I mean I I've seen so many different things so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and I recognize that there are good schools out there I mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people right
but uh I don't I don't understand the uh I don't understand I guess why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities
uh well I don't pretend to understand that either uh but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools but then again I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put uh because the the dropout rate is in those areas it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and and crime and they all seem to go together and it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle whether where you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better so uh the other two they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to to fix but it's just like I I don't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like I don't know it's it's a complicated issue I I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school I don't know if I blame it on the school I think I think I blame it I think I blame it on a couple of different things I think I blame it on the school system uh
well that's I meant when I said the school yeah I don't blame it on the teachers in the school I although I think that I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than well they do quite well for themselves
huh well that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid no not all school districts are well paid but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid I mean I know one family that's got they're both teachers and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons
uh huh they both work all summer full time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
yeah well it it I mean that family is making over a hundred grand and I'm I mean okay okay yes I agree that teaching our kids is important
right however these people who only work eight hours day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that and I don't even have kids
yeah well that's true but there's you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong but when you're and there's really not much you can directly do about that I think that that if if there is a problem with the school system uh from it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh paid that perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved uh you have other professional jobs and this is a profession and as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on are you in the middle of anything?
no I'm not in the middle of anything I've just about the last thing I did about maybe oh close to a year ago now I guess I I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house so I guess that the whole thing?
yeah that that was fairly large undertaking a a it's a bedroom and a walk in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house did the framing and all?
oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking huh
that was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't we we weren't sure how to do that and maybe you and I should get together because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
yeah that's the exact opposite we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together
and whatever you have to put in there to get the to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that yeah
I we didn't know a thing about any of that and so my wife wishes I hadn't done that
it's it looked very hard to do so
we figured well just I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy
probably so and I we'd never done it
so we just left it alone yeah
but that's I guess I'm only twenty one so I my my vast experience of home home owner's knowledge is not very much so it's just what I have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so did you you framed it in uh on on you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed? it was brand new brand new
we started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was and you knew how you knew how to do the framing?
uh well my dad knew how to do most of it you know uh huh
he he'd we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it I don't know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put a like a not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less it's not you know it's not enclosed it's just somewhere to drive another car to to park and it's do do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?
uh it's off the ground on the piers?
uh huh it's on about uh twenty two inch piers something like that did you had those poured
so or you did them yourself?
uh no those those are we did those ourselves so you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete? yeah huh
exactly so it's well the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of
yeah those those are we'd I've done one I helped somebody do one of those before those are those are you know you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way but it's no I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job
yeah those are nice they're pretty forgiving you know you can always tear stuff out and redo it it's a
yeah yeah that's not near like building a house or anything but right
yeah those are nice especially when you get done you've got something you know I don't know I like them you just sit down on on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue yeah
I I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff or I yeah that sounds nice
all done by yourself huh? yeah I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
designed so we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts and uh and then the rest of it I just did
yeah a a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the uh foundation work but uh it was pretty it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that I just put on so
yeah that's pretty that's a good size deck yeah
so yeah that's it's uh not that expensive I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know no less than that
yeah that's not cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together
yeah that's good that's not bad at all didn't have to yeah
the wood may it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know to get to get good lumber it costs I don't know about dallas but even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all I was surprised I'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are
it's probably more there well yeah it probably comes from where you are
yeah yeah that it probably does most
I I'm not sure but when I drive through that area that's all I see is pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards
yeah it's nothing but woods up here down here yeah
I don't I haven't I mean I haven't I used to live in dallas in arlington actually uh huh
and but that was just when I was a kid so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore but it's I don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any right east texas
we have gas is a dollar dollar twelve a gallon so that's probably about what you're paying huh
so yeah my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to uh you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that so yeah that's a lot easier you've got something going all the time
okay looks like we're ready to go capital punishment uh the problem I have with capital punishment is that uh uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but I don't think that it really actually does that I don't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are uh are committed with a without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe I shouldn't do this uh because uh I might get the gas chamber or something like that they worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it and uh how about you?
well I think that in some cases it is warranted uh huh I do too yep
and I don't I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not uh huh yeah you still have to do it I I
I mean I mean I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer uh huh
or so you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then well for some things right
I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood uh huh uh huh
needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society
I mean you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again right and then do it all over again uh huh
and I don't think that that rehabilitation is effective right have to agree with you and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but I tend to agree with you that uh we should have it I just I don't know that it's always effective but I guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it it's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh
but then you know I think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment you know just like for example uh you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them uh huh uh huh right uh huh and I don't think that would really warrant capital punishment
uh huh huh do you think they should be punished at all or uh like go to prison uh because they're not really a danger to society it was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that
uh it is to a certain extent uh huh
but I think I don't know because I know they put uh put them in jail sometimes I guess uh
I think in and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available uh huh uh huh um
uh huh you know now I wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago I guess in biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment so if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person and I know that uh if somebody had done something to my family I would feel that I had the right to to get revenge on them and uh but I I don't think that's done much anywhere that's kind of drastic punishment
well I think that would be kind of drastic punishment right and might make you feel better but
but one thing I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated uh huh right
but like I said if if someone is is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society uh huh right uh huh
right because they're a danger to everybody else huh that's interesting I have to uh agree with that
but there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh and uh
and a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison right
right probably more of them then the other way around interesting I don't I don't not sure I I'm in washington d c or at least very close to it I'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here
well I know in north carolina we do have capital punishment uh huh
and I'm in I'm from south carolina
I uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair
actually uh that is really a sore spot with me I I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago uh reliability of automobiles at least u s automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal
uh huh and uh it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea yeah but uh I
so do you have a car? pardon?
do you have a car? well at that time actually I had a volkswagen rabbit
uh huh and uh it was it was a real lemon uh subsequently I got a uh buick century and it wasn't as bad
uh huh but uh last year I bought a honda accord and I take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it and it's wonderful
yeah we used to have a honda accord and they're good they're really good cars every time I get taken to an auto repair place you know every time I go I get taken bad you know huh
woman goes in and they go all right we got a sucker let's see how much money we can get out of her you know huh
that's what happens every time huh
uh so so what do you have?
I have a pontiac six thousand all the more reason to uh have a a honda
yeah but our honda just got old and just wore out it was let's see eleven years old and it just just out of it so no so you bought a pontiac?
huh uh my uh ex husband's this is just happened a couple of weeks ago he's my ex husband but just a few months ago when he was my husband uh his father gave us this car and everything is wrong with it I mean the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know now how old is the car? uh eighty seven huh
and he just doesn't take care of things and but I was awarded the car so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic and I can trust him so he is trying to get you know things fixed on it huh
but it's just you know leak leak leak everywhere but uh you know I hate to go into a a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not you know and charge me twice as much the last time I took it into a repair shop the man told me I needed a master cylinder so I said okay and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then uh about a month later a man was looking at my car and he asked me you know not a man not a repair man but just a friend and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on and he looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder huh
and I didn't even know what one was and uh he showed it to me and it was old rusty just awful it was no more new than nothing so apparently it was the same one that was on there
uh more than likely apparently just uh uh probably filled the the brake fluid up and that was it
that was it probably it was I was so irritated and that's happened to me more than once or twice just just about every time I've went in somewhere so what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service
and and you can hardly find one you know huh
the guy that's doing most of my my car now uh goes to my church and that's the only reason you know I go to him because I know him uh huh
and I know he will tell me the truth because he doesn't even charge me for for doing it so he's not going to you know take me right
I just pay for the parts and he does it so well that's wonderful yeah you're lucky
yeah I am so I don't know I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all we took our honda to the honda dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car oh really?
yeah and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars we you know they told us we just had to have one and we bought one we didn't no more need no new engine give me break you know huh
so it was it was not good and uh okay
how are you? you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget? yes yeah well I I I feel like uh I am from mars I mean I'm fifty years old and uh I've been divorced for um eighteen years but I've two kids and all but I uh I I've never had a budget and I don't uh do any planning and I don't know
I don't uh uh I don't have a long term financial plan I don't try to control my expenses
but I'm I'm glad you're a stranger
that sounds kind of like me but really I'm I happy I I well I'm curious how other people live uh so maybe we should start with you what do you do?
about the same thing really?
yeah oh maybe they're going to arrest us both
I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children and uh we live from hand to mouth we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we due for the next month wow
a couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it uh huh
the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope yeah
and when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area uh huh
and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent uh huh
it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money and we did that pretty successfully for about three months and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do huh the uh I had a part time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six
and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that and I actually did my bank account would uh I'd I I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but I I had miscalculated I well I didn't keep a balance it's one of the problems I never had to in the past
I always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary even though I wasn't spending much money I sometimes I sometimes would just things would get to tight uh and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time I uh I spent money I mean cash mostly I would uh write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning uh huh
uh huh but I would forget to write the things down and it that I I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever
I even find now like with the automatic tellers I'll go take money out of that yeah
and then I forget to take that out of my checking account uh huh and uh yeah
so I I I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there uh huh
and I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make uh huh the uh I I have to say that let's see at this point on I don't run out of money uh and it uh and I don't I mean someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have and I I I think my strategy if if I may is to is to not spend money I mean I don't have expensive tastes I don't go out I mean I buy a car well the last car I got rid of I'd had it was nineteen years old
yeah people were embarrassed for me I mean it was it was a good car and
but it was still running oh it was great my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty five buick and it just wouldn't stop uh and it I I just didn't feel the need for a new car it isn't like I couldn't afford one
uh huh uh and now I mean I I don't uh I tend to eat expensive food I mean I don't mind buying a good steak but for me I only do that every week or without even I mean maybe once a month
yeah I mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that
not very often but but I'm just I'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying I mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to
that's right so so that's I think one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have I don't I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing a lot of why don't you start?
oh I don't know I uh I refinished a couple of old uh dressers that were handed down you know nice it's nice tongue and groove uh uh construction uh that's been I've been pretty successful with that things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that? what? are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing?
no I've done some other things too uh you know yeah I've done both
yeah uh uh my wife has picked up a couple of things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture and uh we've done it a couple of times I guess that we've been fairly successful with those
oh yeah that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it I guess
yeah that's a good way to get started uh I have a a uh really nice desk a nicer desk than I could afford which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire
uh huh and uh we stripped it all the way down and refinished it and it turned out to be really nice uh a nice desk maple top I think or or something of that sort uh huh uh huh
yeah I I uh put together a a up rolltop desk from scratch oh really? you know a kit oh I'm jealous
yeah still had to cut it and everything but it was fun uh huh
yeah I I do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking I've built my own deck and uh things like that uh huh
yeah I I've done the same you know like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that and uh I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too
my I uh I picked up a bunch of craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive
uh huh and so I do have a band saw and a router and uh things like that out in the garage but I can't say I use them very often
um yeah I'm looking at trying to get a router right now they're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times
putting doors in is the time when I'm uh I bought myself a uh template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
I'll bet but I've also I've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
uh huh so I got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it and now I use it twice a year maybe
yeah my my brother's used it a lot for making drawers I don't know the big
what what's your opinion of what a good router is like? you know I uh I guess it
because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great they've plastic parts and stuff the ones that what?
that you dial in on the side uh I have never even I have never even looked at one closely uh the the little use that I've gotten from my router I would say uh I would spend my money on the bits uh huh
uh huh uh I have a I'd guess you'd call a medium quality craftsman router and the uh
how strong is it? it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time but the problem is that the uh as with any any time you buy a a tool with a a as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end don't they uh huh uh huh
so the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably uh I mean a a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars and uh uh if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it because uh I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself uh they won't last and I've never had the bits sharpened so that's a thing to consider is to uh huh
they they really get hot don't they? yeah and they they dull after awhile especially I did some cabinets in uh ash and oak
uh huh and uh that that wears a bit down we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen uh huh
right and I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth and uh routing hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so
yeah I've cut some one by eight oak before boy was that fun right that's uh
big solid pieces of oak are just tough and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right
well that was you know with a with a circular saw uh huh like oh my gosh right
is this going to be fun? yeah well I've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening because uh treated wood will also chew them up yeah treated wood can really make you sick too
actually I've been involved in electronics a long time uh in computers and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home uh up until I guess maybe about a year and a half ago
oh yeah I got one for my son a a macintosh uh l c
uh huh it's a real easy to use color uh computer and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work
uh huh well I've I'm currently in school so I I've had an I b m clone I guess for a couple of years now which I've been trying continually upgrading I guess and uh I've found I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it and I can't really I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis so huh
it it's very essential for me schools have them uh but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school it's very easy it's much more convenient to have one at home where you going to school? at georgia tech I see yeah so in engineering?
yes actually so that explains all the uh computer assignments
yeah it uh well do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work?
um sure I have some games of course which I play on there and uh uh I have a program which allows me to access a uh weather data bank so I can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby so it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on so have you do you have a computer for yourself at home? no no I just have one for my son and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing oh yeah
yeah at at work uh I'm a technologist uh and I in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming uh but now I find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a uh word processing system and a communication system uh huh
yeah yeah do you use email and like that? yes emil is probably pulls down a third of all my time
yeah it's I I uh I have modem night computer so I can log into the the uh network at georgia tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful but uh yeah that's that and word processing is while I tend to I mean obviously I do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments uh huh
so it's it's really become I don't know really become my mainstay I guess I can't even remember actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a a to do a report because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer t r s eighty when they first came out uh huh
and I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high so huh well I'm a old timer I did my master's thesis on uh a typewriter
oh yeah uh I rented an I b m selectric
oh and it was a pretty big deal
yeah it must have been tough it's a little bit strange for me I I did my master's thesis uh last year and I did that on a computer and it seems like I just can't imagine how people did it before it must have been just so much so much work yeah it uh well you know it's just it was just a completely different world then
yeah so uh so you used your son's macintosh then? do you do you find it do you like that kind of computer? I like it yeah I like it from a distance really I I see the packages on it uh that are available and it's nice I really don't use it myself
uh huh uh I when I come home from work I I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things yeah
huh uh so I let my son do it and uh of course you know there's uh there's an intellectual evolution taking place where
yeah it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like v c r s and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy
yeah well if if if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge go ahead
uh have you every been tested for a new job or anything? uh no I haven't but in my job I'm a nurse and we are allowed to be I mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime uh I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested
so it's just sort of uh they can if they they can if they choose to
oh okay right have you well have you had any experience with it at all?
uh not really but I've always worked on a university level but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff uh huh so what do you think about that?
uh I don't I don't think they're very accurate because I mean I know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test and I know they changed afterwards right right see I know of that too and I also know that things like antihistamines sudafeds things like that can really throw it off and you can not get a job because of it and they may not tell you the reason why uh huh
yeah I I had a friend it didn't cause her any problems with her job but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen
but what it was was she had been she had been uh in the jungle and it was some malaria medication and she tested positive for that see and so it really is a dangerous thing that way because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job and they weren't told why but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing or they would tell you or this person never use any drugs
see I always I thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests uh you should because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something I have real mixed feelings about it I don't know
how do you know how wrong they are? are they I mean is there a margin of error? the accuracy? I don't know I don't know but I know there are a lot of things that can influence them and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time
yeah and if you could show that I I interviewed for a job recently and I was taking entex and my doctor gave me a prescription for it
uh huh and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know and it didn't come up that I needed to do it but this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything yeah yeah so I don't know
and I I'm not so sure they are that needed yeah I'm not sure either
I mean the only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check
if you're using it while at a job I can see a problem yeah
but the occasional person then it's almost like it's almost an infringement of your privacy well it sort of is and this is it this I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways you know as a health professional I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs
yeah you know so as a patient I feel well yeah we probably should be protected but on the other hand there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too so you know I guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way
yeah you can't go around testing everybody for everything
yeah so I don't know and I I think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you I think that a company or a boss could use this you know they could keep on doing this to you or something I guess I can see where it could become a problem
and it it's like it seems like now they have tests I guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago really
oh wow but maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago so
I know that's the other thing I mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever
yeah there's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult yeah but you can't say it was wrong at the time I think that's true
yeah yeah so that probably wouldn't be too good either
so what kind of music you into?
well I have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music in fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that I don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal the opera yeah it's right on track I like classical but I can't deal with opera at all
and heavy metal uh it's noisy I'm into uh some industrial music that's a a bit even harder than that
uh huh but it's it's got to have a point to it
oh I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to
but uh the the uh basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying yeah what kind of progressive stuff?
uh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh nirvana and uh oh you know I'm thirty so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the clash and and the sex pistols and r e m that sort of stuff uh
uh r e m makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed oh yeah yeah it's a lot of people like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out
uh huh I think that's pretty much you know bull because r e m really hasn't changed if it's it's interesting
they're producing uh similar music and it's good music
uh huh but you know people have picked up on it that's good I think it is I'm impressed
uh for a while there music seemed to really popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it I was really tired of uh the michael bolton
michael bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes oh yeah
and I could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money uh but he picked the right songs and and that that's about all he had going for him or still has for that matter I guess
that and a marvelous hairdo oh yeah
yeah I'm sure that that that sold a lot for him that's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop I'm I've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop
it just seems like there's no no real point you hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises uh huh and
well it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music uh huh
and I like a lot of classical music but I also dislike uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time
yeah I can I can believe that what kind of things are you do you like in classical? what's the standard? uh
stuff that I like uh I like bach I tolerate vivaldi I can't stand uh uh debussy or debussy
uh uh I like tchaikovsky he can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined oh yes
uh and some of some stuff that I like uh for instance frank zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition uh huh and that's interesting music
but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's frank zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive
you know we're we're much better off playing uh beethoven's ninth
that's right you know we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it it's safe
and it it just isn't chance taking enough for me
uh I feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
well I haven't had an awful lot of uh incidents regarding child care when my two year old was in new orleans she got bit on the cheek and uh but uh that's about the the uh the extent of it
but but but when I really am am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation
uh huh and I and I and I'm saying to myself well you know you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place and they don't pay very much and why why would they be interested in in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know
uh huh and uh that's a terrible kind of thing and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it
uh huh well I am a working mother I have three children and my children since I uh since they were very young I've had various um different alternatives child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it I personally feel uh in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids I think are very very secure well raised children my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities huh
so I I I you know it is a problem and but as you pointed out I I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford when our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid baby sitter that was wonderful huh
and then as they got older they went to uh I preferred to call them schools and they were really all day preschools and they were wonderful and I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things oh well that's interesting
but we did we really truly did pay a fortune I mean we were paying at one point well about about a close about five hundred dollars a week for two children oh my god
so well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
well I I'm a physician uh and as is my husband oh well yeah
and and I felt uh very good about working I'm a pediatrician actually uh huh
so uh but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for I think well not not all of us you know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for I'm an engineer oh well and
I think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in and we had a really wonderful arrangement uh I'm with the university actually uh huh
and they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work and so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing and they had wonderful they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio yeah
so that that sort of an most of the teachers had degrees uh five hundred dollars a week for two kids yeah that's incredible
it was incredible actually oh oh
but it was good I mean it was it at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition I paid a little bit extra but the kids were well
I mean they really had some great opportunities but
what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage and and really have feel they have to put their children yeah
sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying situations you know
they could somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know that's a good starting wage
uh huh but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care uh huh
no even that that really I think I don't it's been awhile since I've looked at my youngest child is eight so it's been a little while since I've looked into actually daycare centers but they are huh
you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since I mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to baby sit but mine are twenty two twenty three and twenty seven so you know that
uh huh I guess baby sitters now are up at what five dollars an hour? something like that oh my
well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children I mean it has been a real uh there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences and I think I think they have captured a certain market again the but then there are baby sitting groups as a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections uh huh
as you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around oh yeah
I don't know what you drive now I mean what do you drive now?
uh I have a ford pickup and uh the family car is a uh a dodge caravan and uh because we have three kids and they're under thirteen oh okay
so uh throw them in the back
they sort of fit our requirement yeah I have a one of those uh pickups with the uh seat with a seat in the back cab oh yeah?
and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work yeah
right now I can right now I can throw them all in the back when we have room and uh and since I do a lot of projects I throw things in the back there you go
and I kind of like having a pickup truck yeah
actually I think of it as a as a car that'll last right yeah I know
I like the way trucks are built and I don't care about comfort so I'm pretty happy yeah you're looking at I got a toyota four runner I wanted a truck that I I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too so I got a four runner
so I wouldn't hesitate to get another one I I never buy new so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck you're just like me I've never bought a new vehicle in my life
and uh yeah I don't I don't need to pay for the glitz I'll let somebody else uh have the showroom shine no
and I'll pay for the rest of it let somebody else break it in right
right and uh the van we're we might go again on a on a van we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time I'm not sure yeah
we have to we we'll have to face it in a couple of years but uh I I guess we had a small toyota wagon right
and we were real happy with that because uh my my second requirement after price is uh low maintenance right
and uh it certainly had that we didn't do much to it at all yeah
so yeah my my pretty much the same I I got a like I say I got one of those toyota four runners
uh huh and uh it pretty much does everything I need it to I mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and it I can throw I've had eleven people in it before believe it or not
uh huh and uh it's real reliable I I mean I've had it for almost four years now and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it
uh huh and then of course two weeks ago it decided I don't know it's the strangest weirdest thing in the world but it blew a head gasket
uh oh didn't do any damage to it uh I caught it real early
how at how at how many miles?
uh oh ninety seven thousand
huh so it's not real early
you didn't overheat it? no never overheated it I smell I smelled the uh I smelled the coolant
uh huh went out and looked saw it was saw where it was coming from drove it right to the shop and left it off
huh well that was and that was it because I I have that and then I have a a kawasaki motorcycle which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining uh huh
yeah I mean that's that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle
it it's a I don't know people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves
I have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it's not raining and uh uh he's a it's he's pretty conservative guy I don't think it's much of a sport for him I guess uh I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it I'm sure he does yeah yeah so you know
when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving? yeah
no and I go out twice a week on the bike so at least just for the enjoyment yeah uh
yeah but yeah I I mean the only thing I think I might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car uh I would consider going to a a non to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one I've got just because there's a lot of times I wished I had just an open bed to throw stuff in
right I'm sure I'm sure that that's very I mean you got one it's that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and
if I only had some place that I could store the uh camper top I would have it off most of the time right
I really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty to have it out of the way right
but uh they're solid uh trucks are built uh I mean I think they last a lot longer than anything else
they're the only things americans still know how to build and uh yeah yeah the trucks do uh even though you know the jap the little jap trucks are are good there too but so are the though I think the chevies I don't think the I don't like the chevies as much as I like the fords
yeah I think they I think the fords tend to last a little longer at least until recently right I I kind of like mine
yeah so mine's a ford a friend of mine just bought bought like a year ago it it's a really nice truck I mean I don't like dodges at all but one of the dodges they have out now has a uh the cummins turbo diesel on it
oh I heard about that yes oh it's beautiful
yeah that thing that thing will last forever I mean
that that's a serious truck oh yeah that thing's uh it's got a boat engine in it
right this uh I I know a contractor who just got one of those uh huh he's pleased with it
I you know actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many convenience appliances and whatnot we don't even have to cook dinner anymore
yes yeah really uh but I uh I've heard I don't know this for a fact but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together
that the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
that's what I've heard too uh it seems bizarre to me I don't quite understand it although I think probably the the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television
yeah not so much because uh it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming and I there's also some uh I think uh poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time
right it's so darned easy to turn the thing on
I know it I've I tell myself sometimes just sit down after work so I refuse to have one in the house oh really? yeah
well good for you good for you a lot of people I talk to a lot of people about that and I've thought about it myself and I though about it a lot uh huh
but uh I still haven't done it yet well that's good well I'll tell you television sure makes child rearing easy on you I mean the kids can be a real pest uh and turning the t v on is almost like magic you know it's like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center and you don't have to worry about them that's true I've noticed that but I don't think it's too good
I don't think so either uh so you know I don't know I take advantage I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but I take advantage of um dinner time we always eat together and you know whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them
do you keep your kids uh active in sports or anything or uh I guess our big outlet is music uh
oh okay our thirteen year old son plays violin and our nine year old daughter plays cello
okay and uh when our son started playing violin I took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello
so there's plenty of plenty of interactive time in uh practicing although neither kid likes to practice I guess that's not a big surprise
no not for kids but I I imagine with infants you are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them although
yeah well I I try and read to them
and I take them to the park and stuff and yeah oh you know reading is so good
I uh I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
yeah well they get to that stage uh but I read you know there's this doctor seuss sleep book have you ever seen that yet?
sleep book no yeah it's called a sleep book and uh you ought to get it I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized uh
we've got quite a few of doctor seuss books yeah well I think I think his sleep book is my favorite oh really? uh huh
well yeah I like to I like to do it and they enjoy reading I've actually I never read a lot growing up and I never read until a few years ago I just started picking up books and so I've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read to I like to get away in a book you know? uh huh uh huh
and so I've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and uh huh so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day?
oh I probably spend an hour or two oh that's great
my wife works at night so she does uh tupperware so she's gone a lot at nights and so I spend a lot of time with them oh I see how old are your kids again? they're two and one two and one
uh huh yeah so you have your hands full with them that's for sure yeah
do you think that there's any way that uh or do you think there's too much crime now? I mean I guess any crime is too much but it's out of control uh yeah yeah
uh well uh out of control I don't know I guess it could be worse uh we've uh we've we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood uh I live in the university district in seattle near the university of washington uh there's uh there's a lot of problems I mean there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people and uh you know we get cars on our block uh regularly uh uh uh gone through rifled through and stuff really?
yeah I would not of okay I would not have guessed that in seattle
yeah you figured it was like omaha right? yeah you know
no it's uh it's not newark but uh yeah it's got problems yeah I wonder I mean I wonder what what really is the answer I mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system
yeah I think most people regard it as a warehouse where you put away the people that are so bad that uh you don't want them out in circulation yeah
but but the problem is is that we we only have but so much room and we we try to put aside in the warehouse and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes yeah and
that's what I hear so it's uh
yeah I I think you know don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea? I get the feeling that a lot of people have I'm not convinced that I have
yeah uh see I mean my mom taught english as a second language and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes and uh
oh you mean she taught in a prison? yes
oh in a in a maximum security prison down in central virginia I see
uh and the problem she had was not with the inmates at all the the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison I mean it was it was I mean
yeah the the bureaucracy they they put her I mean I didn't obviously I didn't see the classroom uh and hopefully never will but uh they they put her at the end of a hallway
there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body a body alarm which
uh and I don't know exactly what that is but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people yeah but uh you know
so she didn't feel safe no she didn't she didn't she she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates and then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse and uh she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around
yeah but well she had decided that it was when we came back to the states she decided that it was too she didn't feel that public schools were were safe so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison yeah right but uh
well at least it's maximum security right yeah but but the point that was that it you know you said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible and and I'm I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it
uh well I I think the people that run yeah that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical you know uh
I mean I uh you know I I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff and it's uh you can get pretty hardened I'm sure but getting I mean well see I always have problems because because I can never decide whether or not I'm I'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but
yeah right but I keep I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is circumstances
those are funny labels see I mean I can't help but wonder if if I grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison at this point? oh yeah oh oh yeah
absolutely I think uh yeah I think you can blame it on social problems sure I mean I don't know
I mean as as you know as poverty has gotten worse as you know education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's been more crime we've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program
yeah there's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse
and yep it's a mess I don't I don't remember the the gentleman's name but the the uh the mayor of baltimore is a is a rhodes scholar and what he
is he the guy wants to like deregulate heroin or something? well what he wants to do is take all the money that uh he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education
uh huh and basically just just attack the problem at the demand side
uh huh stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't I mean switzerland tried the the grand experiment and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park and
see when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pay is regular but uh you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and I I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that anybody could get in in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do what's what's your feeling about benefits? what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company
well since I'm kind of on the the older side you know I I I just feel like uh when I start talking about benefits I talk about I'm concerned about medical benefits uh my uh my husband works for mcdonald douglas and so his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know that's really great uh huh
you know I work for uh a bank western financial uh huh
and uh they don't let me know really about anything that's going on even some of the immediate things that I need to know I don't know it until the next hour and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made we're changing departments we're changing policies we're changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing I mean I feel like if I I don't necessarily need to uh be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know I'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh the company is concerned but I I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if if I had a little bit more information along that line well I I well I work for the government
and uh actually I work for the f b I
oh my gosh and uh and so you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that that we should know about projects I'm an engineer you know
uh huh I'm I'm a cotr and and I I worked in the same lab with a guy and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years and we should have you know we're we're now collaborating oh and
and it it for two years we didn't and we which was a kind of stupid but uh but our organization is doing something else on monday uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways and every all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which I thought was kind of interesting and but uh but that that sort sort of thing yeah that is interesting
but if you I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
exactly and and but of course most time most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing in the private sector I would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties is keeping a job until you retire
right and engineers are uh are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy I'm getting more money and I'm getting more responsibility I'm doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
uh huh and pretty soon somebody falls off I I've fallen off twice in the private sector oh and uh and you know I can get up
I know it it seems to be be kind of kind of scary you know because you think of uh see my son's eighteen right now and he he's uh he wants to go into engineering and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open and he's interested in basically three different areas but uh it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that he needs to do his own course of investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years uh huh yeah
and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical I mean my uh brother in law is like uh I mean he's sixty he's not ready to retire but his company is is uh is uh closing up uh huh
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on he's getting cut back and he's not ready to retire yeah he may be retired
okay uh generally I get uh you know most of my news uh in the you know weekly magazines like time newsweek and and uh u s news and world report with with occasional smatterings of of uh you know the wall street journal and of course the local paper
uh huh but uh my my only complaint is I really don't enough time to to look at the articles every day and and go through a paper you know exhaust the details so that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? well yes I I well I I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article
uh huh and and so I I I like the weekly magazines uh because it gives me you know the high points of what's going on
uh huh uh but many times uh you know the the local uh the local news kind of suffers you know but here I am you know cheek by jowl with our nation's capital and
oh that's right you're very close actually it's almost a uh bedroom community for the capital yeah yes
exactly well when when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself hey guys I'm inside the beltway
but uh it turns out that uh that that the c n n is I think is great and for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
uh huh but generally they're they're they're more sound bitish you know kind of thing and and I don't really uh you know I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient uh you know dose of news that way
yeah a lot of my information comes from several sources probably pretty high up on the list is national public radio uh which I like uh huh yes
uh I I think it's fairly objective and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative and while there's an inherent uh filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read uh I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of uh favoring the other side that's that's potential indication of balance and generally I really do believe they are pretty balanced uh I also read time magazine and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the uh various uh of the articles and the front section and uh well the mercury and the and the and the chronicle are the only things that are really can stand up there oh
oh you did you use to live around here? uh redwood city I use to work at anteks
oh okay oh yeah okay I know exactly where that is anteks amdahl and places like that
yeah we we get the mercury which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper yeah
the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times at well the los angeles times which I've found to be a uh a very good quality uh newspaper uh huh
and I like a lot of the articles there the other thing when you said we don't have cable t v so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is is called c span yes I I've I enjoy see they have uh we have two the both c spans here but but really the on the public t v you know macneil lehrer is one is an hour's program that I always both?
uh huh if if I watch any news program it will be macneil lehrer and and occasionally c span
uh huh I I like a I saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of marion berry's drug bust was the whole thing was was run on that and and and also they have the uh the uh uh parliament's question and answer period
oh I never say that that would have been interesting it
yeah I I think that's always fascinating I wish I wish we had something when when it first uh you know when it first tuned in on that I you know it's one that's I think it was somebody was just scarcely just just ripping the hell out of another person
and I and everybody was you know making noise in the background and then yeah
but it's usually the prime minister right? here's this dude in a wig thatcher major and I said to myself it's another monty python that I didn't know about
and then and then up jumps margaret thatcher off her green bench and I said oh it's parliament
which could be another of monty python yeah so I I thought to myself I can't wait I'm going over to to britain in mid you know in mid may I I I'm going to uh you know you know approach my uh you know this is how I discovered you know the the prime minister's you know question and answer period you know
I I have seen that and uh a aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in american politics uh which I really enjoy I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions I think and it's unlike the fairly controlled uh press conferences that presidents of the united states have here where they they always seem yeah
okay so I guess it starts recording now
okay okay I don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in we live in the saginaw area
saginaw? uh huh and I'm not real familiar with uh anything that I fact as far as I know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here and uh or the grocery store or anything in this area really? yeah
the we live in plano and they started off recycling by uh putting the I think at each wal mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now I guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans and uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now and you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum uh huh
and you set it out and they pick it up and it it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response really?
so that is pretty good I'm we're originally from another state and I know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing the city brought ought you know set separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it you know
did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for for cans I don't really know
even or I don't really know they they started after we moved down here and so I I'm not really familiar
yeah I just know that uh my in laws up in up in oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up but I don't know if they get a get anything back on it or do you get money for it?
no I just I noticed it iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can oh
so you don't see too many thrown out around the streets or even bottles really
you know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to I guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in right
I I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel right and now now most of them are throwaway right
so maybe that's one thing they can do I think now they're a lot more expensive than that uh I bought some cokes the other day in the the little bottles you know
uh huh and I think the bottles were like I know they were at least ten cents apiece I started to see at home I was like god how much were those bottles you know?
yes and it was they come in like uh eight and and eight and ten packs you know instead of six packs
right and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles you know I was like god almighty it costs more for the bottles than it did for the cokes that was my brother's first job in a grocery store he was in the bottle area in the
it's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over but but it's uh it's quite right
they say that the green glass now that there's a big glut of green the green glass oh really? of green glass
yeah it's amazing well out in this area they really don't have anything now I know that like minyard's and places like that around like arlington and fort worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front uh different colors for different things and and things like that uh huh
right but I I do know some of these places were doing that and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them right
yeah it's I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs yeah
it it's people just they they really don't uh there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff yeah more than it's worth
it's I don't know it it can be it's not as easy selecting you know clean junk as they say
right well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
that's right that's right it's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher right uh yeah we all do it
well it was nice talking to you it was nice talking to you I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything
oh I think I think two or three minutes is fine is that it?
yeah okay well it was nice talking to you and I I guess I'll do this for I was doing this for actually I was going to do it for my son so that he could uh he he's in high school so that he could make some money
right uh but then it has my name on it so I'm like okay I'll sit down here and call it
well we're doing it for a church choir so oh are you? yeah oh that's interesting so that's nice well well thank you thank you bye bye bye
okay what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling?
uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup uh huh well that's more than we have up here in massachusetts some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect and they do have bins set up but I live in a a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
well here they and uh live in an apartment complex uh huh
and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins I I know a lot I think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort whether and and I think that and I know massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh that's the majority of people that I know of anyways where people aren't really you know eco conscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do and I'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away that type of thing
right they here they're trying to push through a bill but uh people need to be more conscious of it
and a lot of people are against it and it's going to create a lot more work for the uh the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything yeah it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans uh and and matter of fact I think it took like three tries for it to go through but and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle so it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing and that's the big thing I think that they try to promote
right I think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate yeah that's a good idea yeah
there definitely has to be a motivation factor and I know that at where I work I work for a defense contractor and there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage because of the uh the process involved in styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that and and they're very proactive and uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it I think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that
uh I know uh I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual trash yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article I saw in the the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time a guy went to a a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time
well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper yeah
they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them yeah
now I think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out yeah okay
okay randall uh uh do you have any special interest in uh space flight?
oh yeah ever since I was a young and uh used to watch the old uh apollo missions going off in uh classroom t v s uh huh
uh I suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off uh huh uh very exciting yeah
the uh uh I've I've always uh wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that and uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen uh huh
of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday uh huh
but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately what do you do now? uh computer programmer oh
unfortunately that can be done from the ground yeah to bad huh
yeah made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space
the uh uh I used to think when I was when I was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now uh huh uh huh
uh frustrating at times uh huh
I don't know what you think about all that well uh I uh I'm kind of young I'm only twenty two and so uh uh I'm not you know there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties
uh huh uh although I have a I I kind of wonder uh if some if it were possible to market some uh form of uh space technology you know to uh uh to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the uh respect that you know there's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and whatnot
yeah it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy well yeah
well the uh uh I've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up uh huh
uh because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact exactly
and you can just get as much power as you need up there uh huh
it's just a matter of how big you build it uh huh
uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing so the side effects of doing that which I think would be good you know very very good for for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also so I'm right yeah it seems like uh there's so you're talking about positive side effects then yeah right okay I understand
right uh right sure that makes a lot of sense
the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there uh huh yeah
and they want to do the research and uh they're all you know yeah
the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to mars which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth right exactly
but the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and you know so forth uh huh
it it would it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of instead of for you know uh huh
we should eventually send someone people to mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so right
we should do it because for for the return we get for it uh huh
and uh unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened exactly least not
I I would settle for the for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the uh but uh yeah
the downside of that is you after you do one of those people say well we did it right
now let's now we're done now we're done
no need to use this to play around with this space stuff anymore that's what happened with apollo uh but uh I'd give almost anything to get into space yeah I think you're right
I would too I'd I'd uh was it john denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle? what sort of company do you work for? do you work for a big or a little place?
uh I work for georgia tech yes sir I work for the research facility uh and it's it's kind of small in a sense but it it does have about uh I guess two thousand civil employees uh huh
and on a a scale I guess it's still considered small it just have a lot of different laboratories uh huh
the area I work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so uh huh
so that's make up most of the laboratory so from from that standpoint it's pretty small it's pretty small uh huh
what about yourself? huh well I I work for uh actually probably similar kind of place I work for uh lincoln laboratory
oh okay uh yeah we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech
oh okay I see uh and uh so we're we're part we're actually part of m I t so it's very much the same kind of place and uh the technical institution oh okay
right uh uh while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a and a job I guess uh list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that uh huh
right I don't know what are your uh what sorts of things would you consider important?
well those and probably the security aspect of it uh huh
because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working uh you're treated and it may not be true in every place in a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a a person uh huh
because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and and you know their well being as far as you know how they going their next dollar going to come in how they going to pay their bills they just lay them off yeah
and I was reading this book one time about this guy that had uh I think the company still exists what they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know uh huh
that way that you know one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time uh huh
and uh you know I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better you know other than you know something like unemployment is good but I mean the company as a whole because you as an employee even the company is making money they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth you're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than you know uh neglect or something like that uh huh
you know because it's not a person's fault that you know people not buying or businesses are are not on the up and up all the time you know I don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of a company situation now how do you mean that? I know it
well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people uh for the bad times of the company uh huh
what about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well uh huh
you know in that standpoint well you you think it's better than to to try to spread the the effort equally among all the employees of the company or yes I do uh huh
I really do I think it'd be better that way and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that that there are problems uh huh
and you know there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time yeah uh huh
you know that's just that's my views you know yeah I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that I think uh back about a few years ago when things were tough hewlett packard did that for awhile they went to a uh a a four and a half day work week rather than cut yeah just cut everybody back ten percent and uh have to give everybody a half day a week off right right
right and I think you can do that for a little while but I'm
well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know because the way it is a person really don't have a chance yeah go ahead
oh okay yeah the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care and that's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children but I did run a child care facility for a while um
and uh have some well you should you should have some opinions on that then
I do have some thoughts on that yeah uh it's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or parent for a lot of people there and uh it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities well I guess if I were going to choose I mean my first consideration would be safety
right my second consideration would be uh uh health
right and uh I guess my third consideration would be uh warm environment warm personal environment
well right uh in texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level so you meet the standards but then after that there's there's a lot more I think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people uh in terms of not just just because somebody has a child or uh likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that uh oh absolutely
as a matter of fact I believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children
exactly and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people and it's the most difficult of all for a parent judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving
oh but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are
oh exactly and the other thing that's difficult in uh it's a too small setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't want to just warehouse the child and I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important and you have to have the right kind of enrichment and that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe and and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for but also his uh developmental needs are cared for too maybe the right thing to do is to uh when a couple has a child then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and I think I would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting that would be lovely get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six
uh huh and then uh and then of course to make up for that uh the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer you know in other words they probably would not work may not may end up not working at all in the twenties uh
well that's an interesting thought because but then they have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety that would be okay
that would that would help on the other end too in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be right well you know the uh uh the world is changing uh from from uh industrial uh base to uh information base and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work uh huh
that's exactly right all you have to do is have a sharp mind and I believe that uh mental acuity is easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind
oh so I think a person could work uh into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter if they didn't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could maintain uh what do you think about capital punishment?
well I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes yeah which crimes do you feel that?
well I think first degree murder uh probably warrants it yeah because of so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent right selling I think should also
exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever yeah
I come from a state that has well I originally come from the state that has uh the death penalty I come from florida uh huh
and uh they're pretty liberal on it they tend to like fry people left and right which yeah that's
go ahead go ahead texas is too texas I saw on t v the other night is the has had forty six in like the past several years
yeah so they're pretty hip on it too I guess they do it by lethal injection at huntsville
yeah okay I think florida still uses electric chair yeah
uh I don't I don't know in some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing god yeah
and that's not I don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it yeah
I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not um yeah
with florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year they yeah that's what's happening here there is like uh that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of uh uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again uh huh
sure and it's like you know that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build uh huh
and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a big problem yeah
uh go ahead I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't
right be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years
uh huh yeah because a lot of these guys you know they get in and they they get off for good behavior and I don't know up in minnesota where I am now they don't have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know because they figure well you know sure I I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something uh but then for if I if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten oh really? oh sure you know goodness
I mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails uh you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early uh huh yeah
but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head uh I don't know I think that may solve a lot of that yeah
maybe not solve it but I don't know maybe I yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient
yeah uh kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty
uh huh what do you do georgeanne? I'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas
oh okay great what program you in? uh audiology okay fantastic uh yeah what do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the university of central florida oh really
yeah I'm doing an internship up at honeywell oh really? uh yeah neat
but uh I don't know it's it's an interesting issue there's like you say in texas there's been quite a few and and in florida in the last few years I think there's been a lot I can't I you know I can't give you figures but uh yeah I just this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in california
uh huh so I think it the forty sixth in the last twenty five years I think is what
oh is that right? they gave a run down that texas texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then okay
yeah I I kind of yeah I've heard things about that I've heard that they don't mess around very much yeah
uh they they don't get repealed as easily as they do
uh huh like the guy in california got you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you don't have to go and then they took him back I mean it just seems yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent
jeez that's a lot of repeals and then you have like two you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know uh huh
yeah I don't know I I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it uh I guess what is it what's the policy now with treason? do they uh do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? no I don't I don't think uh the military doesn't execute anymore so
yeah or death before the firing squad or whatever
yeah so I think about the only one is uh rape what's your uh
uh are you into the cowboys? oh god no
uh no I'm not I haven't been I grew up in dallas but I'm still not a cowboys man I like philadelphia eagles oh yeah? yeah well that that's all right that's my favorite team so
uh now that randall's coming back next season I hope they'll be do a little bit better they didn't do too bad last season yeah
but I hope they can do better how about yourself? well I don't know I kind of go back and forth uh depending on who's really hot and who's not I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects
uh huh but uh I guess if I have uh my druthers I'd probably go for the seattle seahawks oh I kind of like them
yeah that's another one of my favorites yeah they're kind of
they're not they're not my favorite totally but I do like them I like yeah
seahawks are good they now that steve largent is gone I kind of lose a little bit for them but you know he yeah
to be honest with you I I probably watch uh college a little bit more than I do pro really? yeah
huh I kind of like college actually quite a bit
yeah that's kind of that's kind of strange it's too much running for me in in college football I like I like the pros is it?
they do you know it's more high tech more you know players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when it's a job and not just you know yeah yeah that could be
when you're getting paid millions to do it you I think they take it to another level yeah
but I can see it's more you know grunted out run the ball type college football is a little bit different but yeah you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then who's that?
notre dame? no I root for nebraska quite a bit
nebraska yeah there's a running team
yeah that that that's boring for me I I'll take the passing teams any day yeah
but well I can see I can see definitely how you get into that I to be honest with you I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well and
yeah it's just it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle right
that's you know it gets kind of monotonous after awhile I I prefer forty a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit sure
and but well I think they're starting to realize that a lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore
yeah it's high dollar you know it's all it's all money now even college is all can we get on t v right so yeah
that's that's so uh what's this world league is coming in? uh that's getting ready to start up right?
right yeah have you followed that very much or
uh not really I I don't think anything will ever take over the n f l I think it's basically you know it's it's an institution yeah
it's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball it's just I just you know yeah
I mean it it it can be it can take over part of it but it's never going to be the next right it can take over a small market share but nothing really
yeah it's going to take a little bit some people are going to watch it but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every sunday afternoon or anything you know right
it's just it's never going to reach that that standard but yeah I think I agree with you it's it's kind of interesting to see uh to see their claim of you know like world football but when in reality it's really americans playing somewhere else you know
yeah yeah it's kind of it's kind of strange uh I guess we're the only ones who take it that far
everybody else still nuts over soccer but yeah actually uh I kind of like soccer I've never really played it
yeah? but uh I like the idea it's it's an interesting game to watch that and rugby I've like to watch rugby every now and then
yeah or australian rules football that's yeah whatever you want to call it there
yeah that's some brutal stuff there that's that's worse than football as far as violence I think golly those guys kill each other out there rugby is something else yeah yeah there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere
yeah that's just wild that's why it's a a big college thing yeah
rugby is definitely big in college because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do right exactly yeah
so yeah I could see the feel for that but it's it's pretty it's fun to play yeah I'll give it that it is fun to play if you don't value your very much you've played it then?
but you know I don't think rugby will ever be professional but it it's it's no I doubt it you know not at least not in this country anyway
no you can't stay healthy and do that that's a rough game yeah it is
but uh I don't know I don't know how my eagles are going to do this year so you
the the seahawks are an up and down kind of team they really are yeah
yeah my my it's kind of odd my roommate that I live with here he's uh he's lived in pennock minnesota do you know where that is? uh no I don't to tell you the truth I'm
it it's a small town it's about two hours it's in like central minnesota it's a couple of hours uh west of minneapolis okay
but uh to tell you the truth I'm not even really from here
you just live there now yeah I'm I'm up here for a year on an internship
uh huh well he's but I I actually live in florida live in florida yeah
like the seahawks well you know I I mean who who who the heck is going to root for tampa bay right?
hey I I I've only been to philadelphia twice and I you know I I still like
really really I mean I guess I could go for miami but I don't know
yeah but I'm from I root for nebraska so I'm I don't have a real love for miami anyway
but I don't know I I guess I get into pretty much
okay I'm here how do you feel about public schools?
well our public schools are are really poor I feel uh huh
uh I'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation but uh we're toward the bottom yeah
and uh there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong that you would think it would be easy to correct uh huh right
but the system doesn't allow for the corrections uh huh
how about you? well that's interesting I have a sister who used to live in kennesaw georgia
oh yes and uh she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there and she complained quite a bit about their school system there yes and
and cobb county is better than the county I'm in right
she was in cobb county right I'm I can't really say much about the schools up here I really don't come from here
uh huh I'm only up here temporarily on an internship but uh I live in orlando florida usually
okay and the schools down there from what I know are not bad they're pretty good
well that's great but I know that in some I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
uh huh for example I have a brother in north carolina and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad uh just terrible
well I feel that we're way behind uh I have a son that is in the fourth grade huh
and uh they have just now taken up division wow yeah and that is slow
uh my husband and I go to the store and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things and I feel like uh there are several areas that we're just really really slow in uh huh
and uh I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system it is what do you think's wrong to cause that?
well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely yeah
uh she my son's teacher has twenty seven students uh huh
and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis uh yeah perhaps
but more than that I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children yeah
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office it it you know it can it can really be bad yeah
yeah that's that's one thing I worry about
uh also I think we have a lot of uh hispanics there you go uh huh
and we have a lot of uh the county I am I'm in the minorities are mostly hispanic yeah probably quite a few black people up there and and
no we're from a county we're from the county they marched in we're in forsyth county oh is that right?
yes and we and there's very very few blacks oh okay
uh so so that's uh I I hate to say uh it's not a problem uh because I hate to feel like they are a problem although they are yeah but you know it it's you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever but then again
but it is a problem uh especially in the inner schools inner city yeah there is no denying that that
sure you know teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
well and you can't put all the children in special education that's right you can't do that
uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know right
see I grew up in nebraska
uh huh and the school that I went to there was fantastic it I I really consider myself very very lucky uh we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty seven thirty kids to to a class yeah but
but your teacher had control yeah we zipped right along you know I I was I was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily uh huh yeah I I believe I was too uh
uh huh but you're right you know with all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline I think uh huh
uh well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school yeah
we just can not afford it right I was going to ask you if there if that was an option uh if
well here in logan utah we've got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley huh well here in seattle uh it's the air's getting more and more polluted we're uh we're in kind of a basin and uh seattle is on puget sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains and uh there's been a lot a lot of growth population growth around here and uh it's uh it's getting worse I think most of it is from cars yeah
yeah definitely here in utah up along the wasatch along the western side of the of these rocky mountains here where a lot of the big cities are salt lake and ogden and provo and logan's up in the valley a little bit further north we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars uh huh
and uh it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion and when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the wasatch front which match that of l a a few years ago oh
it's not it's almost sad because when I grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys yeah yeah I live in the university district
and uh uh it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution I think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school
huh and then we're right next to interstate five also
they're getting serious about things like uh mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions oh yeah have they started doing that yet?
yeah they've actually started doing it down along the not in logan up here cause we're doing a lot better we have a lot population is a lot lighter up here we have that here and uh they're they're expanding it to uh more counties here uh as the population spreads out and I think they're also going to be making it uh mandatory for more cars there was uh something in the law about if your car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore and I think they're eliminating that uh that loophole yeah
yeah they're eliminating that out here yeah
they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust kind of like a radar gun and oh really you mean they could do that remotely? yes
yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually huh
and now where does the source light go?
like across the street they'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense oh I see
and they're also looking at uh other you know ways of monitoring this and cause they've found out something basically that uh and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much uh of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a properly tuned car jeez
and and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know you it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half yeah that's neat
but it's also been uh oh you know everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but it uh it's tough you know like I've I've looked into riding the bus to work and I can drive to work in uh and get there in twenty to twenty five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over lake washington on one of the floating bridges
uh huh but if I uh if I take the bus it requires several transfers and it takes over an hour
huh so so it it's it's not hard to see why why I keep driving
yeah and they're and you know I feel guilty cause I'm driving a okay thanks
huh do you all have a budget? well uh yeah we we do um we've been married for twenty three years
uh huh and we have uh three teenage daughters and you know they're very expensive so uh uh we yeah we have somewhat of uh a system uh it's it's kind of uh you know it's kind of hard to explain
yeah we've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts we always had just one
uh huh and now we are having two uh it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal
yeah it's uh so I have to be that's that's kind of the way I feel about it
yeah I usually uh my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course we're like like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month you know yes
and uh do you have a two income family or one income?
uh we have a two income uh family yeah she also works yeah
and uh but she she enjoys it and she's good at it uh if it's if it's I am kind of uh uh I'm pretty bad about procrastinating uh huh
and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe yeah yeah
you know how that goes but uh uh if she she handles it pretty well she uh she writes all the checks you know once a month so your wife
yes it that what her is her career uh related to to finance or accounting?
uh sort of on a peripheral she's uh uh an annuity administrator oh
and so she uh she works for an insurance company uh huh
but but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff and uh yeah so that's sort of related to her field a little bit yeah sort of yeah
and we you know we've experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh but if you know you have to keep up with them so a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear we try to keep our uh our retirement and our savings kind of automated yeah
so we never see that money just like taken directly it's just taking it out right right yeah
yeah yeah we do the same thing
and that that's kind of handy yeah because if you don't see it you don't miss it yeah if you don't spend it you have something to take it out that's exactly what we've always done
yeah and we've had uh they've always had uh where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then they will match it
uh huh uh that you know we've done that too but my husband works for an insurance company
uh huh and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years I guess but he was with another company before that but we have we have I I work also but I only have a part time job
uh huh and I get paid very little but uh you know I try to use that money for food jim gives me a certain amount money you know we just transfer it into my account
yeah uh huh and then I use that for food household expenses and then I add my own check to that and then with that I try and handle you know some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that
yeah but the expenses that we need and have around the house
yeah it sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do so
just kind of play it by ear but keep the the deductions you know yeah yeah we
well jim has jim has a budget I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down
uh huh uh you know I am given so much money a month so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that
uh huh so I try not to you know we don't you know I don't ask for more I mean I just try and make it on that
uh huh yeah because I think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have yeah
uh huh and uh you can you can really waste a lot of money that way
yeah so uh well how long have you been married?
uh about five years yeah oh yeah so you're just really getting started so do you have a family too?
uh I've got one little girl she's like uh nineteen months oh yeah yeah
so uh she's she's not uh she hasn't effected your budget yet really
not not really not too bad uh no not like she will later on
yeah you will see that all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do yeah when
uh huh and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know
yeah what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but I think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
yeah and then as the girls got older I think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older
uh huh uh but uh but what do you do? do you
I'm uh I I work for I'm an electronic technician oh okay
I work at a for a university uh georgia tech uh research oh well good and uh good
so I just uh well we just have you know we have a good friend that's about to move to atlanta I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things I'd better get back to the subject
oh well but uh budgeting I found you know I feel a lot better you know we use to work out of one check book
uh huh and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month
yeah now I have know exactly what I'm spending and it's so much easier one way or another we're now recording okay um um oh yeah home repair
you were helping your parents right I still am really they're uh sort of remodeling a house out in downtown atlanta in candler park
uh huh and uh we've done lots to it we've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them and so you're remodeling? uh huh okay how about you?
well I I just live in a I live in an apartment now I uh two summers ago I went to massachusetts uh huh
and I went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house uh huh
and this was a a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say uh huh
and we started in uh we started from an empty lot with uh trees and stuff on it
and we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot we had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement pour the basement and uh went from the ground up wow
our one of our main problems was wow
well in massachusetts I thought I was going to well it was a a fun time but I thought gosh summer time you know uh huh
well all it ever did was rain and thunder storms
and one thing is that we're we had we were going to pour the basement foundation uh huh
and we're in the process and it started pouring down rain huh
and I guess we had most of it done but the end was result what happened was that some of the the a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not uh a very good finish uh huh uh huh
but it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay yeah
but uh it kept us pretty busy it was only uh there was well me and my friend and then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a a family type uh huh
it wasn't you know like a commercial project or something it was sort of just you know uh gets your get his you know my my brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing so that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes uh huh wow
and and then materials coming in uh huh
and so we're we're hopping around pretty good but overall yeah we got it done and it's a three bedroom two bath house and it's pretty neat nice
yeah so nice so uh I mean what was it for? you just
well it was uh for my friend's parents they had some property there and they'd lived in this this old
it's sort of like a farm you might say and they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something uh huh
and his mom just wanted a a new house you know uh huh
that has been her dream and so we did that and uh she was really pleased with it so it came really great that's great so wow
so what why is it that the weather in atlanta that gets very hot huh?
where you live it gets very hot? yeah it does
and that's why you and the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in? huh
because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in uh you know the solar game? right
have you what what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or no we just we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it
oh okay okay and uh but it see in a lot of the windows?
uh huh uh it's the house is eighty years old and it's had several owners and stuff and uh they have put plastic plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows okay
oh these so you have the sash windows in? uh huh
did uh did it go up and down? uh huh
oh I see yeah and so uh and and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there uh huh so
yes there's a problem with those those are uh they usually most of the time don't open very well yeah ours didn't
uh huh and the ones that would open uh wouldn't want to stay open they wanted to slam shut uh huh
uh huh and they also there they they a lot of vibration and it causes the glass to crack and it's a never ending problem uh huh uh huh yeah
so so I haven't uh I haven't been in any really home repair things lately I
regarding uh taxes I you know taxes are really a necessary evil and in a civilized society but really people get upset at taxes because you it's more efficient to do things yourself
right and uh and so as as a result uh you know it's it's a trade off you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others you know how much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others? have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really don't deserve it?
uh well yeah I know it's it's a lot you know that uh that I feel like you know just like you said that there's just so much that you can do yourself that you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either but yet they accept it well the thing of it is if I wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader I guess I could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know look for uh look for people to uh take care of me like so many people do
uh huh and uh probably a good woman right?
right just you know just just con somebody to take care of me and then you don't have to be on the tax roll
right but uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing and everybody really hates it it was very timely I I I always over pay my my deductions so I wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding
uh huh so uh you know that that's always a smile but of course you know I've I've paid it in and I should calculate it better
right you are you in business for yourself?
no I I I work for the f b I
so I I'm a federal employee
right yeah guess I don't sound like it huh?
uh well I no I think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as as everybody else you know unless you work for internal revenue yeah I belong
oh I I've got all four feet in the trough you know being a federal employee
yeah and and so but but I can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits like every every time there is a a bond issue you know I vote no on every one of them uh huh
right I'm I but there this is this is tax not tax revolt country I mean there's too many every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know plus our snout right up to our ears
yeah so you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that that you want to you know get into a tax revolt situation
right but uh uh the uh the local taxes here I I in this particular area uh you know I've uh I think I pay about uh oh thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know and which is a lot of money
right and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing
uh huh and and they they're building old people's homes uh you know at tax expense well I think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper at thirty three hundred dollars or thirty five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes why I I could go down to bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right?
yeah that's right you know in in instead it's it's the taxes here so
yeah course I don't know whether I want to go to bulverde or not you know or seguin or someplace like that yeah
yeah but uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer and and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer if you're not going to use them then you want to be in in environment that's a strategy I think that the people have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living you know I'm I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire and and I'm saying well you know I really can't stay here uh as a retiree
after you retire yeah it's too expensive
yeah I'm going to have go out and you know in you know east fork someplace and and do my thing you know right
my parents are in the same situation you know they their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes and they have no children in school or you know anything now they don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards right they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five you know
uh yeah and they're not doing it again you know
yeah so well it's certainly uh uh you must be a t I employee you must be what? you must be a t I employee?
no I'm not you're not a t I who do you work for?
I I don't work I'm a student I go to school I'm in nursing school you you're
well the question was talking about the juries and uh one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that uh maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again uh so that uh a judge I think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day
right I I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases uh the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed right
uh I I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case right
so a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there uh huh
and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate uh sentencing yeah see I agree with you uh one thing I heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court I mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything uh you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and you're done with it it's almost like the night court we see on t v
uh huh uh and uh but it's not that we have uh such it didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending uh so I that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way in other words not not
there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? yes yes now
I I I don't there's a point on which we don't agree uh huh
I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a one of the parties wants one uh huh
and I usually it is the defendant I guess that wants to have the jury hear the case sure
so I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know
that would require a change in the bill of rights I believe and so oh yes and and I wasn't I didn't mean that
oh oh okay I I didn't mean that no because I mean gee whiz if I was uh uh didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that oh yes I would feel uh you're right that my civil rights had been violated but I meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here we're not going to have a jury you know let's get it over with sort of like car accidents you know
right well I think that's all ready possible yeah
I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh yeah right right
so I agree that that should be encouraged uh huh
people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher uh you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award right giving a different sentence uh huh the take right
yeah and I suspect it in cases like I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil is that right? well I I we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme yeah uh huh
well uh in the case of civil uh things I think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage and I think that may be where jury use is overdone
I mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently right right
but the lawyers are really uh it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible uh huh
so uh I was wondering too if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in in a criminal cases uh huh uh huh
uh I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that but I am in favor of it for criminal cases so there's a difference of my view there for those two right right yeah well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that
have you ever had to serve jury duty? well I was called once when I was nineteen
uh huh and uh but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me and I was doing school and things like they they let me out
uh huh I've never had to it since and that was almost twenty years ago
uh huh it isn't sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in uh
that would have been about uh twenty years too uh huh
uh uh just last year and uh the case I heard was a criminal case and it seemed it really trivial
it involved two bicycles uh huh
we didn't do the sentencing the judge did huh so how interesting
we we rendered a verdict and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing uh huh uh huh
and that was here in wisconsin so I I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it type of music is hot down in texas?
uh well I don't know exactly what's hot down in texas I know what's hot down here with me so that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know I don't ever listen to the radio and that's usually what's hot around here so so what kind of music do you like? oh okay uh mostly folk music
folk music yeah I find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or new england uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up
uh huh well we're on totally different wavelengths okay
I'm more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know uh van halen that kind of thing uh huh
yeah what about uh classic rock type stations
uh I don't listen to the radio at all we live in a fairly small town so uh classic rock for me is what I have which is like uh doors eagles jimmy hendrix oh okay
so some some of the older eagles stuff was good uh
yeah I I didn't like uh they started getting a little more you know the type of music at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes and I don't like listening at high volumes
yeah yeah but uh some of their older stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me
yeah well they you know hotel california and that era
yeah yeah that does that's something you don't doesn't even sound good loud really you know yeah
you know definitely uh so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some I might know of I don't know any folk music at all well down in texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then
yeah oh yeah here I'm sure there's a lot of that down there
oh plenty way way more than I can stand down here
I I don't care for it at all that texas twang or whatever you want to call it I well there there's a conway twitty twang then there's the uh dolly parton uh hollywood sound
yeah yeah that's more even more commercialized for of country music yeah
but uh it's getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as I see it garth brooks is outselling guns and roses so yeah I think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts
yeah it's it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is concert tours for country and western sings is it's it's quite quite odd but uh I don't know it's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays I think it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know hey I I I think most artists are in to make a few bucks
yeah and that's all it but they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were
yeah late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message that's what it
yeah that's what what you say and and then music is wrapped around now now it's the other way around yeah I I don't I don't think gun at least to my mind guns and roses doesn't have too much of a message too much to say
no no they don't have anything really important you want to hear but you know it's kind of odd it's like it doesn't have to be good it's just who does it you know uh huh
you hear a you hear a paula abdul song and you and I think if somebody else were to play that you know they wouldn't they nobody everybody would think that's lousy but because she did it it's supposed to be good you know it comes to the point where it's your name not what you do more than anything right
madonna can do anything and it would be considered good because it's madonna you know right
madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just because madonna does it so it's it's it's really backwards how things are working now uh huh
but yeah it's the artist not the merit
yeah exactly so I don't know I I don't know that that's I don't think that's a good thing at all but that's that's what the point we've reached so I don't know how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least yeah
well I don't know I know for myself that uh for the most part I don't know which artist is which so I listen to a song I either like the song or I don't like it
yeah and then if I really like the song eventually I'll figure out who it was
yeah yeah that's about how I am on popular music I don't you know you don't I don't know enough about it because I just listen uh everything I listen to is what I buy not whatever they play on the radio so well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist?
uh I yeah I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time I don't really switch around to new things very often yeah
it's just it's you know it's way to hectic and too confusing yeah so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop?
uh yeah generally or about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard yeah
and I listen to it that way but as far as yeah I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it yeah see that's one thing I like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know there's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in new jersey
yeah and it's very nice you go into the coffee house and you know an artist is there and very often the artist will have a an album and so if you like the artist you buy the album
yeah so you definitely get to try before you buy
yeah yeah that's definitely I you know it you you you don't always quite get it right
budgeting activity in our household I has is uh uh kind of an informal kind of situation we we you know put actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore it just gets deposited and and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in
and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them you see and so our our budgeting we really don't have a formal budgeting situation every time I've ever tried one it's uh I've just got wrapped in my inertia and uh I've just decided not to pursue it uh what what's your budget situation?
well actually uh I've I've had a couple of different situations my current one has been the most successful uh at a certain point in life my husband my ex husband was an alcoholic and we got divorced back in the mid seventies and that left me with three teenagers you know well actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets isn't it? it certainly is
but at any rate what happened was that I I just absolutely put away all the credit cards I didn't rip them up I didn't send them back nothing I just put them away because there was one that it was really handy to have if I absolutely had to have something I could go use it uh huh
but uh mostly we just spent cash whatever we had and if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it but then as things improved you know once once I got them all through college uh it came to the point where uh my parents came through the depression I'm not sure how old you are well my you know my my parents too you you you were born in in the in the late thirties or early forties but my late thirties yeah uh huh yeah
and uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house and that's kind of the way I was raised and so I'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect so for quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money um
now meanwhile I got had a a building bank balance and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there and not ever have to spend any money on interest uh huh well that that's good
and that that's the way I've operated ever since then it and you know if if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it well we we buy what well we just got through buying a twenty five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher
oh my and and we put twenty eight hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars oh my and you know
oh my right I mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in but but we also have zero interest being paid and we pay it off as as it goes
uh huh and that's the way I do my credit cards now yeah so we never really get that much over uh over extended
yeah I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards huh
but it's the fact that I have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full yeah we're we're doing that we have you know uh this is our our our big uh we did redecorating two you know two new pieces in the in the family room and new carpet I mean we just uh we've just been spending spending spending oh my
I'm envious well I but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year uh huh so we're you know we don't have that
it's time for you to do these things then right? yeah it's uh it's about time that we did that but the the terrible part about it I've looked at it all and it all looks still pretty good to me why why we need to replace it?
but but unfortunately my my my wife really feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate uh thing to to I mean that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it I mean uh I say it might go for another thirteen but uh too late we'll never find that out this is so funny that's wonderful but you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it and
I mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not
you know I I I don't spend that much money I just uh we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they they got through school and that was the major you know decade of expenses you know so we we feel as uh but as far as any formal budgeting uh you know I I we just apparently have been very fortunate when we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat we never really you know have to program money for that or make choices you know but uh we don't have that uproarious a a lifestyle after all we're
capital punishment uh I guess out in california is has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper uh apparently you know there's they haven't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty seven I believe
uh yeah that's that's as far back as I can remember well that's before my time actually yeah they
well I we were we uh we just started we lived in redwood city when we were out there
uh huh and uh and we found that uh you know it was a very liberal kind of community but the uh I I really feel that that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars and then they they uh uh you know lawyers these lawyer groups get together and they uh they I think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years uh and I I think that uh that there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that I think capital punishment uh uh was or probably stringent enough but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way
uh huh do do you feel as though there should be uh more uh was or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment?
well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself it's at that point where they're saying like here you're you're going on death row but you'll stay there for twenty years uh huh
and nothing is being done about it uh the laws exist and are frequently upheld in in uh in appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find and it's it's really getting out of hand in many states well the term technicality the law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous acts are done to uh to you know to get somebody into a a situation where they're going to be guilty of of a crime
or whether uh and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impuned uh but or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a uh a you know a non a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker as being supportive
now I I'm at this juncture I you know I'm I'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality you know that that's what all these these hearings are about and that's what all these you know court cases are about I mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in washington is six days away from getting out of out of the can and uh you know he he tried to appeal his conviction uh and you know it didn't work but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry uh in in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and he you were his slave and if he didn't like what you did he killed you
and that has that's pretty effective uh you know it's not good for civil rights I guess but it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you'll perish either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods so I I I mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh imaginations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing
well it seems like well it it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off um for instance um there's a case a few years back where uh someone uh someone who's being convicted for was under a was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that the the arresting officer uh did not read the defendant their rights uh huh
and where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
so uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?
ooh well I don't know what do you think? oh I don't know I had a little bit more time to think about it I was thinking of like uh I don't know I was started to think about all the big you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those you know demographics studies that they do that um you know have who knows how much you know stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere
uh huh uh huh and I don't know I don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there but I know they use that I mean they sell those huh
well what about uh required drug testing uh as a uh condition of employment? yeah that was that that was the other one I was thinking of I think that's uh I mean I know drugs are illegal
it thing actually uh I uh have worked at texas instruments huh uh huh
and uh they instituted a drug policy there drug testing policy where they randomly would test uh employees uh huh
and actually to tell you the truth I really did not think much about it I I hadn't you know it really didn't relate to me but there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have uh huh
and also uh uh this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing this kind of big brother activity and yet uh a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments although they don't admit to it it's actually oh a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure uh huh
so what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this although they don't actually execute it themselves it's really the government that so in that sense it at least philosophically it's really borderline legal uh huh well I I think the I think that you know a person's competence should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior and if they're you know if they're on some kind of you know controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate them I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a you know a chemical you know
well what about this uh aids epidemic now? where you find that uh uh you know certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for others these people that are carriers and don't that don't reveal it?
yeah and and uh of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't
it uh it destroys their libido yeah that would be kind of an extreme
now uh you know if they ever I mean I've heard of things like you know making them you know marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all someplace like in a kind of
so what about that as an invasion of privacy? yeah I guess it kind of borders on where I mean what do you value more the invasion of uh the person's privacy or the possible danger to you know other people
so really it gets to balancing uh personal freedom against uh the general welfare of society yeah
I guess that's that's been the big role of government I guess I mean generally
well it it's supposed to have been yeah yeah well that's kind of a difficult one to go into I mean that that particular case
no it because I mean there's a lot of people that uh I mean they could require you know obligatory aids testing for everyone because I'm you know there's a huge part of the population not a huge part but a you know
a growing part the aids population I guess that have it that don't know they do are spreading it
uh huh but again to require you know such a test and and then to make make it is to subject them to to discriminatory practices and other things I don't know uh I don't know how exactly I feel about that maybe chop their weenies off your turn
okay uh I don't think they should abolish it I think I think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got but not for petty theft?
right no no for major things like premeditated murder mass murders uh you know that type of thing I don't think it should just be used loosely well it should be used as a deterrent do you think?
well or should it be used uh to prevent further uh crime? huh
yes yes to prevent these people from ever getting out on the street by you know some technicality
and they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before uh huh
and you know that's about the only thing like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know I don't think they should do that well you know there's this old uh jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
oh well I guess if I if it was someone in my family I'd probably feel that way
you know I've never had anybody in my immediate family uh murdered and so I really wouldn't know but but I feel like if I did I probably would feel that way well one of the things I was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value so if you have someone that that destroys that value uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss
uh huh of course you have to also put value on the criminal
right so if you terminate him that's a loss of value
well that's true so you know if you weight everyone equally then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him if you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person in other words you'd have to you'd have to murder more than one other person uh in order to justify taking his life besides him
okay another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people uh which is pretty delicate thing to do but one way of doing it is uh by income so if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then then he's obviously not worth very much
his life isn't worth very much then and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is uh integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of who knows eight hundred thousand dollars uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is uh small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less which means well
right I suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation
potential I mean that's that's the key right there potential uh huh
now are they are they rehabilitative or or not now that's all fine and well and and uh good philosophical but if you're involved yourself personally
uh huh uh I know I have a friend whose uh son was murdered uh on the night before his sixteenth birthday and let me tell you uh I I knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh you're talking about real trauma I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies
I can imagine the father you know of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get I think in terms of psychological impact yes uh and
was he murdered? did they find who killed him? oh yes they found him and he is on trial for capital murder
so it hasn't been a long time ago just recently uh well actually he has I I'm sorry he was convicted uh and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but
yeah yeah that appeals process I mean it's what you know really you know just drags out and out and out my brother in law here in texas his by marriage my sister's uh husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy in in well actually in houston and uh he
uh well I'm not sure how it is in georgia but in in pittsburgh the the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that is that true for for atlanta?
atlanta is kind of high uh it's it's lower than it has been in the past uh I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off and usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher yeah I that's probably not true only for atlanta but for just about anywhere
yeah uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into? any specifics? well uh the least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences what's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners
um but mostly petty things and no nothing nothing really too big
right well I guess here we run into that sometime but I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins right
there are some but not not very high uh as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either there were one case where uh this one guy uh was taking women from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all uh huh
so so that's kind of like a double assault there yeah uh a strange case that uh that happened oh it's about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
really? it was a free standing machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it uh huh
oh wow now there's a crime for you
yeah there's a crime yeah but uh I guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous although uh from what I hear in the news and and I I saw an episode of the t v show cops uh one time that was in pittsburgh
uh huh and uh it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that but I I don't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common
oh okay I don't know crime situations here they like I say lot of lot of cases is usually just apartments and and break ins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs uh drug related you know in in most cases yeah
it's not like uh it's someone do steal a a or television or v c r or something like that it is for drugs you know because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you know you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it yeah
so you really not making a sizeable profit so it's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist you know I just to diverge a little bit uh I live in an apartment right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the university of pittsburgh and uh the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in
right but even so it I mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out you know and things like that yeah
uh huh uh it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in you know
uh huh there's a t v and a v c r and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music
uh huh it could still happen then
yeah that's true but you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not uh participating in any type crime I guess there was one case I was surprised uh so happened this person worked at the same place I work for georgia tech and they work at the same place I did but I didn't know that they had been watching me because I was getting ready to to go in my car one morning and the first thing they said is uh you must don't have to be to work at eight you know like shock
okay uh so your you I guess you're probably in the same uh same situation uh we're in we're kind of past having to provide child care our our kids are grown up we don't have any grandchildren yet but uh uh they're uh huh how old are your children?
uh one's twenty six and the other is uh twenty twenty one uh huh
so they're uh uh they're they're getting there well they're going to be getting there
you know there's no no no prospects right away for anything to happen yeah uh huh oh I see
but uh I have uh five children I have a eighteen year old son the rest of my girls are like twenty three twenty six twenty eight and twenty nine
uh huh and I have three granddaughters right now oh and uh I uh one's in iowa
uh huh and uh she's she's a teacher and what she does is she teaches at a preschool
oh okay and and so she kind of and they let her bring her her little daughter in for free
uh huh and then so but she just works part time
uh huh then I have another daughter in uh bountiful utah and she has to work full time and it's just tearing her apart she has a private baby sitter
yeah and uh the baby just screams I mean the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams
uh huh well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there they're not even there yet you know uh huh
yeah it's hard we and and then I have my uh uh I have a seven month old granddaughter and uh her mother stays home and she they live they live with us you know in as orange county is really expensive uh huh
uh huh they live with us and so of course we love it because we get to see this cute little baby all the time but uh uh she just uh she used to work in pre in the preschool and and and child care and she says after working in there and and you know here she was a provider but you know there's only so much one person can do
yeah she said it's so awful she said she'll never put her child in a in a in a in a in a preschool
uh huh I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere
huh but it's really it's really really very difficult and
yeah what did you do when your kids were growing up? were you well when when the uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years I stayed home
uh huh and uh then after that I I went to work
uh huh and uh uh uh a couple of times I just uh uh you know then I had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job and then and then like about later I I tried to get the baby to a baby sitter supposed to be good uh recommended person from the church and I knew her personally she had two kids of her own and everything but I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
uh huh I mean first of all uh her children were sick all the time so when my son stayed over there he got sick
he got sick yeah same thing same thing that the her kids had right?
right well and so uh we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock then he she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten but that day uh I was saying now he he's sick and she goes well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have that's what he got you know goes well okay so it's not like he's going to infect her kids but then what happened was is I said uh he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway
well you know what that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten she sent him to kindergarten as soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery uh they put him in the nurse's office
guess so yeah and then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby sitter called her and they said uh that he's sick well she wasn't home
huh I mean her all her kids were sick but she wasn't home right and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her? no she didn't do that so it got to the point where he's he's supposed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty and I had to leave work it was it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was still there at school and they were calling me and they said somebody's got to pick him up and I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff and he had a hundred and four fever they couldn't uh give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything
right I was so furious I I quit that job and I stayed home for awhile longer then I went and got a uh a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
yeah a little more flexibility you can come and go yeah but uh I haven't had any good really very good experience with child care
yeah when when our kids were small we had a couple of uh good good women who uh would often uh get them to come to the house okay
okay you go first well I have uh two kids I have one seven and one five
uh huh and uh they're in a public school here in tyler and uh I'm happy with it
uh huh I'm happy with the school it's great good teachers good curriculum uh they learn a lot they have no problems uh but I do live in the better well in the best part of the city though I live in you know the real richy part I guess I'm not
but everybody around me is and uh but they're I have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town and their schools are kind of rundown and uh older and they don't really offer as much I don't know as uh the school that my girls are in I don't really think that's fair you know
uh huh uh but you know I'm happy with what they're in so go ahead
well yeah it it's it's pretty much what I was going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in uh huh
uh I grew up in new york and uh the place wow
or not new york city upstate new york uh huh
and I went to uh the city of rochester school district uh huh
and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial uh huh
and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system right
and that would result in some uh could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with uh huh
as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when I was a senior that some other schools had uh huh
and uh it it so I you know I think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools yeah right
so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of also uh the the family environment you know you can come to south tyler where I live and you have got room mothers in every room you've got art mothers you've got every every holiday there's parties all these kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something
yeah you can go to north tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is you know
uh huh uh that has a a whole lot to do with it you know as far as their learning I mean if the parents aren't uh you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know they really don't have much of a chance at all uh huh yeah why is that? huh? why is that? why you asking
you they just don't I mean I mean I'm I'm up there at my kids school I know what they're learning and if they're up I call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no she's doing fine okay you know uh and I I know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated right
right they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know I'll get through the day and uh bring homework home and there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this
right uh just you know they they take a notion to do it they do and uh that doesn't work either you know they have to have guidance and uh they can't just have it at school and then come home uh huh and there's nothing you know
yeah yeah yeah I know that that that was a big factor for me I ended up coming out of of the public school system very well and was very good education uh uh huh
ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice uh huh
and I think the difference for me was that my parents were you know they were definitely they were always there yeah
was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well and that's the way of course are you
so do you your privacy being invaded at any time?
well uh one of the things that uh that I found to be uh an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the on the uh credit card bill that is something that is not required well right
and in fact uh it is actually prohibited but it doesn't stop many people many people from uh from doing it and it's one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic uh research and to get your your phone number on uh uh lists for phone solicitations yeah yeah now that you can still yeah I've always done that I started once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse and I say what are you going to do you going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine
uh huh I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all and then ultimately they say no you don't have to put it down but uh really it's part of this compliance thing
uh huh uh the thing I don't like I know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles
uh huh that really burns me because hey you're required you have to do that
right and nowhere does it say you asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone
uh huh and I think that it it's one thing to uh voluntarily give it because someone asks you can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody you know
right uh that I don't think I don't think they have the right to do that I agree with you there
that's something that uh people have seen oh here's an easy way to make some money but uh I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not I I've heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state uh the budget problems up here are are pretty tense and people are looking for alternate ways of uh enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use and they were talking about selling the d m v lists and there was a lot of uh a lot of uh consternation about that and the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea but it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made uh public that you don't know about
well that's easy whenever you donate money to someone?
uh huh they you become put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations
right and then you it kind of makes you feel from doing it again
uh huh like uh national public radio or any of these the public uh stations you know
uh huh I I I I think I sent in in money for once to uh to public uh t v
uh huh and I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine
huh I it's like and it just started soon after I had done that one
right and I just said this is this is terrible uh and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old alma mater in college
uh huh and uh it's one thing they don't sell the list but the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people the people do these phonathons
right and they call you up and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and and they say oh we we know you you uh had uh contributed x amount last year can you do better this year? and you know like hold on here
how do you know that? who how do you know that? why why you even telling me this? is it any of your business? I mean it's one thing that I and the college knows that that's just our business there's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all
uh huh just uh and that was very offensive too I and so
last year the uh lotus development company the uh company that puts out one two three was planning on marketing a uh c d rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria uh huh right
well uh does the company you work for test for drugs?
actually uh they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting because when I went to work for them uh they didn't do that but uh since then they've they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own uh convictions but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that huh
how about you? uh no we're not being tested for drugs at all uh our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or its reasons for immediate dismissal
uh huh it says use of narcotics on company premises
um so that's pretty general but uh I work for an environmental management firm
okay and I'm an engineer there but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites but I don't operate any machinery
yeah now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a a medical monitoring program
uh huh because they're at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and I I think that drugs they do test for drugs in that capacity but it's not their exclusive it's just part it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for
yeah but I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field what is the nature of your company's business?
well it's actually uh we do oil well services so a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies and they go out to we have engineers who uh go out to the oil well to the to the client's oil well and and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff so the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their their you know territory and everything but the thing that's interesting is that I I'm an engineer and a software engineer um
and I work in the software uh house and everybody there you know are all software engineers they've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything and yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh all the engineers have to to well a little different actually but uh you know we have to go through the same thing and it's but it's uh it's a little different I guess than than a lot of drug policies in our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away oh really?
other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first particularly like uh we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol and they didn't find any problem with that you know but right
uh we that's been an a an issue uh in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening in fact they'll have these little parties and people will just get I mean I've my brother lives where I work and I have many a time called him to come get me you know and uh uh but you know they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg you know
yeah but uh I think drug testing and I I don't know I guess I I think it's got some relevance but I think its relevance is pretty limited I mean I think you know in your case I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing
yeah I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident
yeah it's really it's really bizarre uh particularly like where we are you know I I there was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle and she she was a personnel secretary and she had to get tested and I don't know I'm ambivalent about the whole thing I you know I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if you know they're they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense and you know it's like you're I mean employments are contractual by nature anyway uh huh
but uh I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that where I had to uh uh do a drug test and and it's it was kind of a long story but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through and it amounted to uh going in uh before any of these interviews I'm not even working for this company I'm going in for like interviews and they flew me out to chicago and and uh before I went into any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical they said it was going to be a physical you know and uh actually beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening but I had forgotten about that and so basically I'd already peed off in that morning and and when I got in there I didn't I wasn't like able to give a full sample and so they made me sit and wait for forty five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again oh right
and the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating you go in there with the doctor he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you what do you think?
well uh I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago uh because I'm not that old yet uh huh
um I can be but go ahead
uh I know that uh I mean obviously you look at at the technological aspect of of social change I mean you didn't have uh you didn't have video games you didn't have home computers you didn't have xerox machines right
I mean uh you you try to you go into a a business today and you you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper and it's almost inconceivable now because the xerox machines and and everything have become such you know such a a a part of the way we live right we fax everything and
yeah we don't even wait for the mail anymore uh huh right
yeah uh a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail and you had to do something this was concerning the s e c and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail right
and now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine uh huh uh huh right
and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder right
because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute you're expected to exactly and I recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse it should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmothers had to bake brownies and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us
uh huh and we have no down time like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to
yeah so we keep moving we don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing so we have no relaxation time in between
uh huh so they say that's really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things
uh huh so that's good that's an interesting point but I just think our our family lives have changed drastically
and I think that's of course a part of it is technology I mean our kids where would they be without nintendo and you know their t v shows and some of that is really bad I think but we have all single families so many single families now uh a lot of working both parents are working so there's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father you know I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
well there's that and there's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen I mean the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country
you're probably right and I'm an o b nurse and that's never really occurred to me but that's that's interesting I never really thought about it that way
yeah yeah I saw that the numbers on that awhile back and I was like uh huh so yeah yeah that's true when is this good or not good
well uh in terms of the long term effect effect on on america in terms of the culture and everything I don't know we don't know that yet
uh most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an extremely large part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation uh from immigrant parents yeah I don't know either that's true
and they're going to be really struggling and I don't think that america is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good right right
I mean it's no longer the the uh the accomplishment that it that it once was and not that many people are really trying I don't think yeah yeah that's kind of scary huh well that's true but I it's just very very different and I guess every ten years it's just been very different
yeah so and I don't know what's going to happen uh I know what I'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers
yeah and they've got their homes and they've got
well julie uh are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly? well I don't know my grandfather is ninety two years old
uh huh and he is still living by himself my grandmother died a couple of years ago but he doesn't want to to move away he lives in a little farmhouse on a farm
uh huh and he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home
is he able to uh still do everything himself pretty well? well he was until this operation he has arthritis
oh yeah and now I don't really think he's doing that well and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him and I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot
yeah but uh my great grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three
uh huh and uh died six weeks after they put him in the home
yeah and I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather's feelings because uh I you know I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left and and for for I'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over uh huh
and I'm just here for the rest of the stay and so I you know I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day to day needs yeah uh huh
they have can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day to day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore uh I know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home they generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all goodness younger than your grandparents like they were in their eighties that type of thing uh but I did uh you know I guess uh when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do take care of themselves physically uh but I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
and that's that's difficult part because I think what they often get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long term care for uh similar to a hospital uh huh
uh I know like here in saskatchewan we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in level in four levels and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long term hospital care generally are not able to look after themselves to very to a very great extent physically often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those or or physical and mental handicaps uh you know where they really require twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal uh huh
and uh but I think that it can be helpful in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need uh but I don't I mean at least I mean I think some nursing homes do that but I think a lot of nursing homes really uh are guilty of neglect
yeah I and I think it happens more in areas where it's uh I guess uh a broad social medical system where uh you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing if it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals and and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding I think that a majority of the places in the u s uh you know there is some government aid available but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay uh huh
and uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely
what kind of crime do you think uh is the most prevalent in our society?
oh boy probably uh robberies people stealing from each other such as new york city?
is that what happens up there a lot? uh that that's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen that's the most prevalent crime uh the ones that really you know the ones that really add up after a while I guess you know from far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs you know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually yeah I I I wonder if uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because I mean so many people use it and even though just using is not really I mean it is a crime
oh well yeah that that that is a crime I guess uh when you when you count all the little things that people do like uh speeding is a crime well that's true
I break that law every day but I was I I was staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use
uh huh well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor but uh what kind what kind have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything?
well I've uh I've been caught with marijuana before so I guess that was a crime I got a year's probation for that but uh that that's not that much I mean you know those aren't
no it wasn't that big a deal I
uh when I think of crime I think of stuff that that affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped I think rape is one of the worst crimes yeah I think it is I in some ways it's almost worse than murder yeah it's very degrading uh
and yeah murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to
you know I mean it is a rather final solution though
yeah right once once a person's you know gone then it's but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life you know yes what what do you think is uh is an appropriate uh punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that
well for for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is it's a pretty good thing I agree with that
they they have that down here in florida still they the electric chair and uh yeah I think virginia does too up here
oh do they? yeah I think I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy and I guess usually they're they're always sure they got the right guy but uh yeah I think the appeal process takes too long
yeah so do I I think I I think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
yeah if that you know the sooner a a a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out I guess uh huh
then you know there's been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and they it's like oops but uh huh well yeah I mean the system isn't perfect I mean it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
you do the best you can to make it perfect you know you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
right but I think you have to accept some of the errors I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment uh for murderers
um yeah I don't know if it would or not though I I don't think it's a so much of a deterrent as as it is a a good uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members you know what I mean? and society probably too
yeah I mean just general society to
yeah it kind of gets it off their chest uh
yeah it does and and it decreases the prison population and which is significant
yeah I know that a a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other I mean yeah
and they're the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that
I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead but I you might be able to uh stop people you know they're thinking about it they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that uh are not premeditated
right I mean they can be but usually they aren't
yeah they're spur of the moment
that's right and uh the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those those individuals I think that you you end up with a uh uh how do I want to you end up with a you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time yeah
yeah they could probably do it again yes they they would have no problems doing it again
that's right they didn't have any time doing it the first time uh huh and I think locking them up for you know fifty years doesn't do a any good because as a as a taxpayer I'm going to pay you know one and a no it your turn
oh I I start okay well uh we keep a budget to an extent uh and really we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm I'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh uh restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid uh about yourself? well I have to say I really don't have a budget both my wife and I uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means and uh our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class I guess you might say and uh we're both so uh frugal that uh we really don't need a budget you know we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing
yeah well I guess that really is sort of uh keeping a budget you know you stay within your uh within your means well we stay within our means but we don't do it uh by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically
yeah although we just moved to california and uh the cost of living here in california is uh I would say rather pathological
yes uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than uh uh they were where I came from in uh dallas
oh you moved from dallas to san francisco yeah so uh uh that presents a a real shock that is a hugh difference
yeah actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to california but
but you have good sour dough and it's a beautiful place to live yeah it's god's country
yeah uh and one way you know that is that only god can afford it
uh so budget is not a problem for us uh at least it hasn't been it may may be at this point but uh up until this point it really hasn't been when I uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago I uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that you know in my discipline was like oh six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that
uh huh and uh I noted at that point that I was you know if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so I stopped worrying about money
yeah and it never have worried about money since then
well that that's a system too sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should but uh I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but
well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips and you do obviously have enough to live on so I guess you're indirectly budgeting uh just bye bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal uh in spending the money uh huh
so I mean that's that's a form of budgeting I would think it's it's kind of a strange topic to to try to for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money well I guess we're both lucky in that regard then
yeah how big is your family?
uh well we're we have one on the way I see
uh my wife and then we're we're having one on the way in uh in uh september so how you once you get ten children though you may have
no I think it's just going to be one oh all right
how about yourself? I have two kids uh one nine and one thirteen
oh and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point
do they budget at all? I mean do you have them on an allowance? I give them a I give them an allowance and they uh I basically give my son ten dollars a week and I put half of it in the bank and I give give him the other half in cold cash
yeah and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank but at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket
yeah if he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually
right uh actually I lived over in europe for a couple of years I lived in germany and in germany they don't have the jury system what they do is they have uh three judges basically and you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not our judicial system is in such total chaos
I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it I mean when you have a man that's signed a a a statement saying he's guilty we have a a family called all day family they were all murdered uh huh
all the people signed confessions they went to a trial by jury they been trying these people now for twenty two years ever since I was a child wow
and what they've done is they've bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they've done has nothing to do with justice whatsoever well you know it's it's one of those things I mean uh uh I would have to look at it if they did it with the uh just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know what's good and what isn't they'd be able to say I'm sorry you can't use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you know you wouldn't have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury and then the judge says oh no disregard that come on any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know
uh that's true I I I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself that may very well be
I I hold it in the utmost contempt uh
the uh my favorite is the police department they're not aimed at the criminal the judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and I we have work schedules we can be called at work we have social security numbers they can trace us down we have telephones then we have checkbooks criminals have none of these things they're real difficult to catch and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check yeah so where do you think they target their efforts? that's true you
they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals well how would you go about changing it?
you know that's a I've nailed the problem down but I
leave the details up to somebody else huh
yeah I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about I think to begin with you would you would have like here in atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical yet you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets yeah
I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from well you know uh talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases it's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh v c r or television repair if you take your t v in a lot of these t v repair places will say well I'll repair your t v for a hundred dollars and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars now if he comes in and says you know I'll repair your your v c r or somebody else's v c r for a hundred dollars gets in there maybe it's a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it's a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get x dollars for that case and that's it
now I firmly believe in that none of this
because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney? oh yeah
and here's this bum that didn't have a job yeah and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford that's true
who's paying for that? yeah
um well you you know you're talking to part of them that's paying for that
yeah and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it that's right you know that's it it's it's amazing and and when you stop and look at it I mean the judges they're all former lawyers
yeah well that's another problem I think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it
I mean they're they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever and with that type person running it I mean you you could expect that you why don't you go ahead and start
okay well I think the court systems could stand some improvement uh trial by jury is good but a lot of time a lot of cases uh is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which I don't think is all the time good because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me I don't know so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit not to convict people on circumstantial evidence?
I think so you know I I attended a trial in uh germany when I was a student and uh that's the sort of system they have
uh huh the trials are held by a panel of three uh three or four judges who are well they're like lawyers I guess they're experts in the law
right and uh there there really isn't a jury and uh uh they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and uh they
uh huh uh I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh uh the judge is also sort of a jury uh but I'm not sure I like that I think I prefer the jury system myself
you think you prefer the jury? you think your chances are better? uh well actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury what what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual that's where you really need a jury of peers because uh anytime the government uh is the government against the individual you need you need the protection of ordinary citizens
well that's true I think that's really the only thing I guess where I would like to see the system change is uh uh there ought to be a a well I guess I don't think that uh uh juries need to decide sentencing all the time
uh huh I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that or uh
well sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair I mean even if well the jury I guess they do decide that but but I'm like you in a case like that most of the time its I don't know maybe I'm too too uh uh conservative when it comes to that the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know uh yeah
well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
right but people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe uh a little bit naive
yeah in texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
uh huh uh it's kind of uh uh a hanging jury atmosphere
right but in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way but I guess I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
oh really? I kind of like that system yeah
yeah that's that's not a bad system but I I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit yeah
but the thing is too maybe they need more of a I don't know more of a expert types to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in yeah right and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
exactly I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
right exactly insurance cases and things like that
yeah where and uh there would be more honest settlements instead of this uh tugging of people's heart strings and uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
uh huh putting on a act or whatever
uh huh exactly exactly so in I think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but
uh I've had uh three boys through I guess uh some child care each one of them and now they're in school so it's all over but uh I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want
well I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months is that right I guess uh the only rule uh I can think of is that I like to look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that if they're associated with a college or a university they're usually a pretty good bet
huh uh I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something you'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care
I guess not I suppose you're absolutely right there yeah for profit places I would really look at them awfully carefully
uh huh but uh when I was when my kids were young I was teaching at a university and uh the child care center associated with our university was quite good so I felt confident that they'd do right uh huh
of aren't don't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? for their for their pet theories or some such thing? oh you mean uh learning type uh yeah? I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission
yes but yeah I suppose uh if you're if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another I guess that's true but uh I never had bad experience in that respect of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents and they you know pretty good people
um well the thing I really worry about is uh the sexual abuse cases you read about uh huh
and I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened yeah I never really worry very much about it I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public so I never really worried too much about that being uh uh the case with my boys uh huh
oh uh I you know I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but
uh huh I don't think it's as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe
uh huh and another thing is cost oh yeah I mean that
I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare right
um well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were uh in school and I'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult and I think it was the right thing to do
um and we were uh we just decided that we would do it and we went ahead but uh not everybody can make that choice and even even though my wife wasn't working we did have uh one or another of the boys in uh child care for part just for part of the day uh or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on so so we did look around
huh I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not and uh so I would always trust her judgment on that huh
huh well I'm just thanking heaven my husband just got a new job his last company he was only working four days a week uh huh
so it's and he just got a new job he's getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not there's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid so yeah do it as long you can
I suppose but I think you know you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for uh how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them uh huh
uh huh and I think you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere yeah you have to start wondering if they don't want you yes right
huh you have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care?
uh I have one but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while uh huh so but I really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems
uh huh I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and uh pay and exhaustion and you know things like that rather than these uh uh really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy this is true yeah current affair can get several shows child cases uh huh well
uh with regard to uh to jury trials I you know I I really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated body of law and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards
so I I really don't think it they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think?
uh I I don't think so possibly in the jury selection would be the only
just for example what we're seeing in california I guess it makes you wonder uh had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome uh and and the problems that that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating uh just makes you wonder I guess whether or not they well won't well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
uh huh and you know the other two guys sat in the car that's that's bad
uh huh and they didn't get beat up you know
no it rodney got beat up because he he you know he you know he involved himself in some sub self destructive behavior
uh huh and uh uh just like the burning and looting is self destruct
uh huh everybody says well this is the nineties
oh yes and they're going to rebuild and it'll be even better hey what do you think you know some some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area?
that's right with everybody with that mind set they they're they're going to that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto you know
they're only going to suffer and you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know
they're only going to suffer they they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence uh I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape and uh well everybody is saying this is going to be a new era and we're going to reexamine this thing hey the the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed they're a bunch of animals you know how can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything forty deaths I mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that I know
yeah it's really ridiculous and I'm just trying to determine you know how you address how you weigh you know rodney getting getting the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths
against forty other people being yeah and there's no other I'm not exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths and I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing those deaths
uh huh is it a looter that got shot by a store owner? I you know no tears
or just a an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what yeah and and so I but I I suspect a number of them um
you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street
or or beaten and and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before rather than stop and uh and there there would have been just nothing but carnage after after after if I'd been at the wheel
um no one would have stopped me right
that's that's exactly how I feel too I wouldn't have uh they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had I seen them coming but I was just wondering since you're you're in you're back east uh and a little closer to the the bigger cities than we are in idaho here right I'm inside the beltway
oh you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and I say well wait a minute I'm inside the beltway and I don't think like that
uh huh I'm a government employee
oh in what uh section of the government do you work? I'm with the f b I
oh oh that's interesting yes and so uh uh and and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because rick who's another government employee wanted a segments of my speech that that were done a year ago
uh huh and he wanted another collection a year later
oh and so this is my seventh call a year ago I did eleven calls
oh I see and so that's that's why uh uh that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique you know I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate
uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers and we keep the newspapers in a in a they're collected twice a month and the trash and and this bottled stuff that is put in a in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck so they actually have about three passes at this collection one for the regular trash one for the uh uh you know the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers sounds
but I gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans
no they they do that on the truck uh huh
they separate them as they as they you know dump them and you know one guy comes around with his truck and and dumps it all in there and I think they're they're running out of uh you know the sanitary landfill I think uh is you know running out of course uh you being from new mexico you've probably been to washington especially if you're your present location yes
you must have come to washington at least once yes I know not only have I come to washington but uh I find it very amusing that uh the thing that was just instituted here is very similar that is we also have blue bins we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and uh landfill space is in deed the driving factor here and in fact uh despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still uh very hard to come by
my you've got a lot a a lot of nothing out there you know
they got I mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could you could use for landfill ah but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
well what other what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what in los alamos? well uh
uh other other than nuking it yes other than nuking it
um in fact los alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general um it it involves for instance uh creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general and uh and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements
well isn't that a that's a that's pretty uh upscale uh trash uh uh situation I don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals
and the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has uh made some special uh polymers that have the ability to uh make certain actinide elements adhere to them
uh uh they've uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
huh and again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh e s and h uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about I think much more than they should actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable
back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the uh paper from the computer center and uh in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable recycled paper huh
well that's certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things I I think it should be it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy you everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound I I think I think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff I think that's a wonderful idea
the only alternative I would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
uh huh and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more yeah
uh huh uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
well of course that uh you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
well we have we used to when I was younger yeah
we'd go every weekend all right
but we haven't done whole lot of it lately yeah I'm kind of into it I'm uh kind of a sailor
yeah I'm up in minneapolis now but I was in florida so uh yeah I was kind of into it for a while there
were you sailboating? yeah for the most part yeah yeah I had a little sail
well we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here no just motorboat's all we what part of texas you from?
uh nacogdoches okay whereabouts is that?
that's between houston and dallas okay all right it's the oldest town in texas is that right? yeah wow that's pretty wild
we have uh lake sam rayburn out here and lake nacogdoches so we do a lot of boating on okay so you got some lakes around you can do that on
yeah you do skiing and stuff or yeah little bit yeah? all right
just got through snow skiing yeah? yeah all right
just came back from denver but yeah that sounds good yeah we've uh our the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
yeah it it it was heavy when we were there though yeah I didn't see any boats there though
not not not too many no but uh no I just got back from a weekend we went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing it was pretty nice but uh no I I have uh I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I do did a lot of sailing on and stuff
yeah? that's a lot of fun but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too they're kind of into it
uh all we all we have up here mostly bass boats oh yeah I guess it's pretty uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh? uh huh yeah
lot of lot of fishing going on up here yeah all right so where about in texas is that? is that centrally located or
it's uh well you ever heard of lufkin? uh no what what major city is nearby?
houston okay and that's south or north of there or something?
let me see houston's north yeah? okay
dallas is south oh okay all right well that sounds pretty good does uh I guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or
it's it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons yeah?
probably seventies eighties in the afternoon okay well that's pretty temperate yeah that's not too bad but uh yeah have you done uh any other boating then or
no I hadn't done any in a uh lately but that's all I used to uh have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop yeah?
and we used to when I was in high school we used to go out go boating every day just about oh that's great yeah I
and we had a different boat every day oh that's fantastic yeah I used to uh kind of be that way myself when I lived in uh north western florida in the panhandle I used to sail about every day I'd work go to work
I'd like to do some sailing yeah it's a lot of fun it's uh especially if you get a a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast
yeah what you can actually
do if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that or they just well actually I I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life uh my family's pretty into it
yeah and uh I took sailing lessons when I was about six and then uh
is it pretty easy? yeah it it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know uh just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
yeah so it's it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of I think and uh generally everybody I've I've known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fine yeah
well that's about all we have yeah yeah lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran
uh huh and uh that's when you really start getting into speed you know you actually some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast you know
I didn't know that yeah they get pretty quick but
that that would be something uh
yeah yeah I haven't I haven't personally done that but uh the races I I work with a guy right now that uh races catamarans in the summertime
uh huh and uh he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good uh
what kind of what lake do you all use? well he uh he's from detroit
uh huh so he usually goes on one of the great lakes I think and does his sailing uh for me I I go back to orlando uh in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast we're about thirty miles from coco beach and the east coast and there's a lot of places there you can go you know so uh so that's a good thing
yeah but yeah so what do you do for a job?
uh I build transformers oh really? yeah okay is that for t I or
no it's for cooper industries okay are they primarily electronic then? yeah okay well well that
they have a you know worldwide but right
all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that oh okay
great yeah how do you like it down there in texas? it's real nice yeah?
been here all my life oh no doubt
yeah okay I've never been to texas I've been to oklahoma but uh that's about as far as
oh it's oklahoma's nothing like it yeah? okay well that's good because I didn't like oklahoma that well
I guess I guess by what you said you're you don't feel your uh privacy has been invaded anytime recently?
no not really uh uh the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls uh huh
that's the only thing that bothers me that's not really invading my privacy right
uh do you feel that yours is invaded? uh no I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means uh you know I would there there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to to tell them you know that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you you know and keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but I don't know that you could call that invading of invading my privacy because you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know I want my name unlisted or want my you know
but but that doesn't work it doesn't?
uh no because they a lot of times they dial sequentially they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything uh huh
uh you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company oh
uh or you uh or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or and stuff they even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
and uh while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they uh huh you call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing
and the local local papers ask them to remove your number from their list and uh yeah you call up their regular during regular hours their uh they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their lists uh huh
uh but the uh orlando paper uh yeah they they refused to take it off of the lists and they call every month huh
and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have good grief well let me ask you about this here's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a a lord and taylor company
uh you know they're a they're a department store
uh huh she received a bill from them uh that she had visited some and and I think it was there in florida maybe it was in miami that uh she had visited a store there and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
uh huh uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving
uh huh uh and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
uh huh uh and and I've I've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using you know they use joe blow's uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit
uh huh if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address and their mother's maiden name uh you can basically become that uh person huh
uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to uh huh
and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her uh if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of uh you know document yeah
and uh the signature uh they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature you know they'll have to eat the charge yeah well
but if the has you know their social her social security number I'd be real concerned that they uh that she's not uh blacklist on uh what is it it's telecredit or something? yeah
uh because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there she probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle yeah well we got it cleared up eventually what happened uh kids too?
yeah oh you laugh how many what ages? well twenty seven up uh and we had five you've been through the fun part oh yeah and how about yourself? I have a four and a half and a three
oh well so it's I I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way in the way it's done now and then
yeah well when mine were growing up I did some traveling and but not that extensively but I always just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them yeah so it was an hour you know yeah but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them what was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest? six years so they were all real close?
yeah that's tough that's a lot of time
oh yeah we look back and wonder how we did it did you both work? your wife too?
no she never did uh well qualify that she worked at home I'm sure
well yeah yeah but that's uh well both my husband and I work and sometimes I feel like you know by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening
yeah maybe thirty minutes max
well that's plenty though and well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking and then I spend time with them while you know he's doing other stuff and and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend you know there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it but it's neat it's straight and I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids you know yeah
right well you know with kids you're not going to have a neat house well I've accepted that too
and you know it it's tough to find time especially with both of them working that's true it is yeah that's true
and you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it well that's true and and we do a lot of that on the weekends you know we try to spend saturdays together
right if my husband golfs you know he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence you know
right and and we do a lot of family things together we're we're kind of going the other direction this weekend we're planning a trip just he and I this is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago well that's good too
yeah that's good that way too well I decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time and and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty four hours a day
yeah well that they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day yeah
and you know and as the kids got older I made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too or whatever sure sure
and and they think that's a family activity you know oh yeah yeah that's great fun
and uh well yeah if my daughter's like mommy can I help you with the laundry? of course you can
yeah just keep them talking that way absolutely yeah
but uh another thing we used to do is have family councils every sunday night uh huh and what would you do what?
discuss everything that didn't agree with them and we'd take turns being president oh
and everyone would get one vote and I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two yeah but it never worked that way so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week
yeah well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too and then oh
and that was always good time boy we really got to know the kids well I imagine and I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
oh yeah in fact they were all in uh over the weekend for easter I
oh that's wonderful see I was raised in that type of family where you know you don't disobey me you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it well we did too yeah
and I remember the one daughter saying we had a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree uh huh
and she said hey I don't make fun fun of your friends so why make fun of mine? uh well
kind of kind of hit us between the eyes yeah yeah you don't think of it that way do you
no but that that was always good quality time for us now that's good I like that idea and then never attend
but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules whatever was voted on huh
yeah and boy they they'd show up well I think that's great
and we'd usually take notes yeah
and you know the younger kids uh or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another yeah
and uh but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us and they loved it I I think that's true I can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment
yeah and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know
yeah so I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves you know
yeah but uh boy I I feel for you and your husband oh why is that? well my my uh two of my uh kathy?
uh huh do you so what is your uh family what do you usually do as far as budgeting?
we have a very detailed budget because my husband is a finance major uh huh
and we have you know we have money that we take out each month that we uh you know for food and and for for gas and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for christmas and for uh other things uh huh
then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our our needs and wants list uh huh
and so uh the things that like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want uh huh
and uh and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item uh huh
so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for yeah my husband is a finance major also
and uh we kind of have the same plan uh we have one credit card and every month we put uh you know the same amount in for retirement uh and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby so we're budgeting uh each month uh an allowance for his education starting now right
right so that's in our budget every month now that's the newest addition but we too do the same thing as far as uh we have a set amount we take oh one big vacation a year and then maybe you know three small vacations so we you know an exact amount that we spend on that each year right and
uh we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money uh instead of just writing checks for things uh huh uh huh if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here I see
and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for uh the vacation that we put in for christmas like you have a separate account for that then?
well a lot of that uh I don't know how safe it is I guess uh we keep it all in a safe here at the house oh I see uh huh
and so it's actually pulled out then we keep our oh I see
we have a savings account for the kids education that money goes into there uh huh each of our we have three children so they each have their own account I see
that money is put into each month uh huh does your husband deal in uh stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff? does he invest in that and for long term? he does somewhat yeah he does somewhat uh huh
uh we have an investment plan yeah I guess he does uh huh
but uh we have really found this is the first year we've done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money really because you're you've you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to so what goes into that that particular thing? it's vacations christmas
christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental uh huh
and uh and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from right we have it you know uh huh
and when when we see something on sale uh instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill everything's taken care of uh huh
and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought really
yeah well you know uh what do you do as far as I I take it do you uh run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing?
I do uh huh all the money uh huh and how what's that?
all the money is turned over to me uh huh do you have a set amount that that you spend each month or or how do you work that? yes
I have a set amount it's very generous and I usually have extra uh huh
and so then that can go uh you know either back into our checking account or I can just carry it over uh huh
uh you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over uh huh
but that's completely up to me how I do that and then uh because I don't work I stay home uh huh I do too I stay home also
and so it's kind of my money and I also get my own money to do what I want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing uh huh
we have a clothing uh envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing uh huh
it really works out great we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and we're yeah what what as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a t v or a big item like for the house how do you have like a household?
yes we have a household budget like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year uh huh
and also we need a new bed and so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those uh huh and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards
