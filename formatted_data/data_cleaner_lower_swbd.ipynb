      "I'm pretty pro gun control over all. I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control. And I must say that there are a couple of arguments against strong gun control which I find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me I find use sort of canned arguments sort of the N R A slogan arguments. And I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it. I guess on a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns. And I have to admit most of that is strong personal distaste. I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort. And guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me. <SEP> Me being from Texas. <SEP> I hope you're ready for this. I'll give it a try. I've got my Texan stereotypes in place. <SEP> I'm not your stereotypical Texan. I was raised around guns hunting. <SEP> So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect. <SEP> I respect them and what their capabilities are. <SEP> And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a Green Beret I definitely respect the power of weaponry. It's pretty power isn't it? <SEP> And here in Houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country. And here you go. Here you. This will be border line N R A which I am not a member of. <SEP> You've heard the slogan if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns. That applies to anything as well as guns. A gun. <SEP> You've got. Any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs. And they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such. <SEP> And they get out their little Mac tens. They get out their little uzis. And they're going to fight with them. And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm. If they want it they'll get it. I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it. They'll get it. And they'll get across the border. My position although I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon anyway. <SEP> Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony if I wanted to buy one I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it. If they want to run a background check on me. If they want to put a seven day waiting period again. <SEP> If they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too. What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it wouldn't. You don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way I would hope. Because someone. The personal sheriff doesn't get to have a gun. And someone the personal sheriff. <SEP> <SEP> the criteria the sheriff would have to follow is this guy a convicted felon? Is he a habitual trouble maker? Are we picking him up every Saturday for a drunk and disorderly. <SEP> And if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems. Just proving that you're basically a good citizen. But if you're not a basically good citizen. You just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway. <SEP> If they want the firepower they can get it. So why hav-. <SEP> Because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are. They'll get it across the border one way or the other. So why have any restrictions at all? <SEP> Let-. Go back to that one to ten scale where one being full gun control ten being none. <SEP> <SEP> <SEP> <SEP> I'd said about an eight. We could be. <SEP> I said the restrictions I would like to see for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun. I would like to see them go through either. I'd like to see a law enforcement agency not N R A. But whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun. You got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics. That makes a lot of since to me. I certainly feel that we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm. But I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so. <SEP> In the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon as a pistol. <SEP> I have a bicycle. And that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things. I'm still puzzled though what is the argument. How does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway. What's the point of putting a restrictio-. Basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway. They're not going to take those courses. Is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns? <SEP> There's. If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices. Does that mean advantage? <SEP> Not necessarily a price thing. What is happening at least in this state. Legislation been introduced that if a citizen of the state being myself has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed. <SEP> <SEP> You're from California? <SEP> L A area? Bay area. San Francisco Bay area. <SEP> <SEP> You've been to the city? <SEP> And all these people come around. Someone attempts to mug me I would ju-. I would. As it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade. <SEP> If this legislation comes through. He pull-. I'm out with my family. <SEP> We've gone shopping. We're fixing to get in the car. This guy comes up. He pulls a blade on me. I can pull a gun on him now. And when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick. What if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon? <SEP> Then it's still equally matched. Having spent time in combat I feel it before they'll get the gun on me. I. <SEP> <SEP> <SEP> If I'm at the same time. I'm sure. <SEP> I'm sure given all your training I'm sure that you'd. <SEP> If I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk through with you because I'm sure you have far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything. I'm quite concerned that if you let everyone. Hasn't yet committed a felony. If you let them all walk around carrying guns. In this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature. You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire. It's hard for me to imagine that. If everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire. <SEP> Actually it's no-. It's more of a police action in itself. The fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying I'm going to mug this guy right here. But he's carrying just as much firepower as I can. And if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it. <SEP> Whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not that's another trip. <SEP> <SEP> but. <SEP> In defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat. Even more so when it comes to my wife and son. <SEP> <SEP> anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink. I know. <SEP> I understand that. What if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake? <SEP> This is where the question of gun control comes in. That was the topic. <SEP> What I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot. <SEP> <SEP> Say a person get. All of a sudden my combat in me goes up. And say I've got the vibes this guy's fixing to do something. I go ahead and pull my piece. <SEP> And I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him. And I will use it right then. <SEP> If he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family I'm going to dust you. As it stands now I've got to do that with a blade. And the only reason I feel comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had. As someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander I feel more comfortable with people having blades because you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly. And. <SEP> If I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss. That's the kind of training I've had.\n",

If I start this I just wanted to say that one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are.

      "Error . But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job.\n",
      "Error . But you ought to try that. It's very good.\n",
      "Error . I'm on a cordless phone. And I was picking up some background noise. So I just switched the channel up on it. I didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record.\n",
      "Error . When I bought my R X seven best offer I got for my other car was twenty-five hundred. I turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred. So.\n",
      "Error . And I think that it's just people have got to be aware. Unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care. And they don't want to think about it. That's true.\n",
      "Error . And I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels. But I stayed in. They were all completely clean.\n",
      "Error . But. That was. I highly recommend that way to go. If you're ever interested in going the route I dealt with this woman. Her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston.\n",
      "Error . And a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China. And she just gave me this woman's name to contact. And it would really be fun I think ideally with two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide.\n",
      "Error . I guess I'll just start by saying that we entertain with a gourmet club here. Which means that we have eight people four couples.\n",
      "Error . So we originally started out when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids.\n",
      "Error . So we try to keep all that in mind. But otherwise I guess entertaining. I guess I have recipes. I. But that's basically what we do is the gourmet.\n",
      "Error . That's. In fact I've even heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less rates and have paid off their higher interest rate cards and just sent them back.\n",
      "Error . I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.\n",
      "Error . Is there going to be a ticket increase this year price do you know.\n",
      "Error . Some of that unfortunately is legal. So they can't stop people from advertising. And that's what it falls under. It falls under the guise of advertising. So I don't care for it. But is it a legal solution for some companies. So that's the way things are.\n",
      "Error . Do you like football?\n",
      "Error . What type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day?\n",
      "Error . I come home.\n",
      "Error . Do you live at home with your parents?\n",
      "Error . I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me.\n",
      "Error . That is good. I like. Do you read?\n",
      "Error . What go ahead and tell me about your home.\n",
      "Error . It's nice to get out in the open air. It is.\n",
      "Error . It's the first and only time I've done that. We don't do anything exotic. We just do tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips not turnips carrots beets and things like that.\n",
      "Error . But it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself. That's right. If I have a problem discipline I think. I really need to get out and apply something. And I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.\n",
      "Error . They're pretty neat little. I've never seen one.\n",
      "Error . And the green onions are coming along.\n",
      "Error . But we've got some this year.\n",
      "Error . What took you to North Carolina?\n",
      "Error . I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was between a Christian college because I thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech.\n",
      "Error . On this subject I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet. But my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home.\n",
      "Error . But I think it's. You got to have the. Living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot. But still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that it's not like on T V when someone gets shot they get back up.\n",
      "Error . Far as crime in the cities I'm sure like in yours it's pretty bad. Probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies. And theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have.\n",
      "Error . And I looked at my husband. And I said you know what Kyle this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip. I bet these are really good seats. And so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor.\n",
      "Error . I'll just hand it off to you. And hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.\n",
      "Error . But that's great. Sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.\n",
      "Error . Since I initiated the call I guess I'll start off first. Number one I have absolutely no problem with random testing. I spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job. And I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and such. I'd feel much more comfortable than I do now based on what I've been hearing in the newspapers. So I really don't have a problem with it.\n",
      "Error . I don't either. I've never. I don't work at home right now. I stay home with my children. But my husband works. And they do have that at his place of employment. And neither of us have a problem with it. We've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and such. It's a scary thing to know that you just don't know what people are doing before they go to work.\n",
      "Error . And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.\n",
      "Error -ing seems to be a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to catch on or maybe a generation to two. And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up. It does seem to be a lot of habits to break. I wasn't raised as a kid on it. But my kids are. And so they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do. And we were doing all right there until the price dropped out. And they weren't worth anything anymore.\n",
      "Error -ing seems to be a a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two. And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up. Uh it does seem to be a lot of habits to break. I uh wasn't raised as a kid on it. But my kids are. And so they they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do. And we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out. And they weren't worth anything anymore.\n",
      "Error . So we went to El Sorrento.\n",
      "Error . I've got a. I have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing. And then that's get rid of the half of the government payroll.\n",
      "Error . If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might.\n",
      "Error . What do you do this weekend?\n",
      "Error . I've been trying a mixture of the bermuda and the rye.\n",
      "Error . I'm from New Mexico. So I was.\n",
      "Error . This. I assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army.\n",
      "Error . I guess my task. I usually ride my bike. I have a stationary bike and a regular bike. And when I can I like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer. The stationary bike is so boring.\n",
      "Error . I drive to work every day by myself without even any thought of car pooling.\n",
      "Error . But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant.\n",
      "Error . I just need to put the old nose to the grindstone. I guess at that point it would turn into a task.\n",
      "Error . And. You're right. I think it's a sixties program. I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he. That was his big deal.\n",
      "Error . I think we ought to worry about our own species.\n",
      "Error . I think that's a lot more realistic. I think that we should be spending more time. And again I don't think the Peace Corps is as successful now simply because. It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.\n",
      "Error . First I need to know how do you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home?\n",
      "Error . Probably the hardest thing in my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home. And she had used the walker for quite some time probably about six to nine months. And she had a fall. And finally she had Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "Error . And that was pretty heart-rending for her.\n",
      "Error . And everybody had duties to perform.\n",
      "Error . Unfortunately a lot of times responsibilities like that seem to fall to maybe one child in the whole family. We.\n",
      "Error . And I think that one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily the quantity of care but the quality of care.\n",
      "Error . And things are scattered so much nowadays.\n",
      "Error . Because the way I feel is if I don't vote then I don't have any reason to gripe.\n",
      "Error . But they should start that a lot earlier.\n",
      "Error . So there wasn't any way I was going to go in there and vote. And it took such courage you wouldn't believe to go vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I didn't know how to work the machines.\n",
      "Error . So he went in. And now he's a registered voter.\n",
      "Error . I don't care to support them.\n",
      "Error . But it really did. And plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of.\n",
      "Error . And it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had. And it just kept coming on up through the generations.\n",
      "Error . And there was a lake. And they all lived down there by it.\n",
      "Error . But lot of times they'll have little cabins.\n",
      "Error . Very very little about it.\n",
      "Error . So.\n",
      "Error . If I was having a dinner party I would probably have some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some salsa and chips around and peanuts. And then. I usually have a little theme when I have a dinner party. So. I would have maybe if it was Greek night or something maybe on the barbecue we'd put cubes of lamb or lamb used for Greek. A shish kabob and mushrooms and tomatoes and onions.\n",
      "Error . I'm in Texas. I didn't know this was from all over the whole country.\n",
      "Error . But if you do have to go something I guess we can just cut off.\n",
      "Error . Jack it was nice to talk to you.\n",
      "Error . I guess it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be. But it's a lot to put into one. It's still. Two thousand dollars isn't just pocket change to a lot of people.\n",
      "Error . Discussion on child care.\n",
      "Error . And so it's. We have lived several places around the U S. And where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area. When we lived in Tennessee we took them to Washington D C to see all the capitol and things like that when they were small. And it's helps the children when they're learning in school to say I've been there and I've seen that.\n",
      "Error . My kids are involved in sports. My daughter has played basketball for six years. And my son plays football. I. My rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.\n",
      "Error . In terms of any sorts of trends I. Obviously things are different for me and my children than when I was growing up.\n",
      "Error . That makes it hard though in terms of family time with him.\n",
      "Error . What type of magazines do you have?\n",
      "Error . And I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that. Because I can remember when I used to do those figurines and things. It was relaxing creative. You felt very creative.\n",
      "Error . Generally people I've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget.\n",
      "Error . And maybe he will.\n",
      "Error . I know how to use one. We go hunting every once in a while. And he showed me how to use his guns. And I really enjoy it. But if someone did break in I don't know that I could or would even grab it.\n",
      "Error . And you?\n",
      "Error . The question was what is your opinion of youth spending a year or two in public service.\n",
      "Error . That's been interesting though the kids that have been over coming back right now.\n",
      "Error . And so.\n",
      "Error . So. I guess down here. We just recently moved to Texas. So my wardrobe has changed quite a bit.\n",
      "Error . So I'm. Right now today was in about the fifties.\n",
      "Error . Do you go camping very much?\n",
      "Error . You say you haven't been in years?\n",
      "Error . I have heard about it. Our little boy is in the first grade. And I taught school for six years.\n",
      "Error . I told him if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack.\n",
      "Error . And if I felt like I spent way to much then I won't go out.\n",
      "Error . Nice talking to you.\n",
      "Error . That is wonderful.\n",
      "Error . They are not learning boundaries. I see it in work place too sometimes. I do not know how old you are. But you sound a little bit younger than me. But I am in my thirties. And I see even people that work with me that are ten years younger. That they kind of have an attitude that I hate to say it. But that's just what it is. It is an attitude like the world owes them something. But they.\n",
      "Error . Where do you enjoy dining out?\n",
      "Error . Or whatever. And most of the time I hear myself saying we don't have enough room left in the jails.\n",
      "Error . It has to be something that's voluntary. Which is pretty much the way it is now. They might.\n",
      "Error . What have you seen lately?\n",
      "Error . And so I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I'm still sort of on the sore side.\n",
      "Error . The first thing. What do you think you would offer as far as information about selecting a school?\n",
      "Error . I'll let you start first?\n",
      "Error . I do wish that it would stop on my end because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments.\n",
      "Error . I really do because he knows exactly where he lives. So.\n",
      "Error . The backyard it's really big too for him to run in and stuff. That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out because he's had all this room to run in.\n",
      "Error . Have you ever had to put your children in child care Mary Dell?\n",
      "Error . It's just.\n",
      "Error . So good luck. I guess we should talk about giving advice though. What type of advice do you think you'd give to a parent?\n",
      "Error . It's just that you have to be able to get your program in. And many of the programs are so big.\n",
      "Error . Mary.\n",
      "Error . Tell me about your home.\n",
      "Error . I'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know. I agree with it. I think a company should be able to test any employee any time they see fit.\n",
      "Error . Do you have any children?\n",
      "Error . She's real good.\n",
      "Error . And I live in Garland.\n",
      "Error . I have a nephew. He's a little brat.\n",
      "Error . You probably more up on this subject than I am. But the roles that women have played in the last couple of generations.\n",
      "Error . Trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject.\n",
      "Error . And they only did it because they were embarrassed that they're so good at it.\n",
      "Error . As a matter of fact what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a blue. And the blue even two years later or so it doesn't match.\n",
      "Error . They will kill you.\n",
      "Error . I figured about that.\n",
      "Error ! We have a few places up here that do that.\n",
      "Error . That would be good.\n",
      "Error . I guess we can discontinue our call now.\n",
      "Error . Hope some of the local. That's what they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the booths. They say that these older voters that they feel like the kids are running the country. So they don't turn out to vote. And they're the ones that really know what's going on have the experience and seen how politicians can screwup or what ever.\n",
      "Error . And actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work. And then usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news.\n",
      "Error . Do you know the question for today?\n",
      "Error . Do you.\n",
      "Error . When they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank. I thought I haven't taken anything back for a long time.\n",
      "Error . From what I saw they were playing. When I was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers.\n",
      "Error . So I've actually paid attention to them.\n",
      "Error . It's like the Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two.\n",
      "Error . You're a baseball fan. You're aware of that kind of thing.\n",
      "Error . In fact I'm a sports fan period.\n",
      "Error . Do you read. I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED. But you don't read many sports books. Or.\n",
      "Error . My girlfriends do catering. And always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray. I think they try and suggest it.\n",
      "Error . Something I do. Is I'll make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them. I have two nieces. And they go melt some chocolate chips. Go buy me some strawberries.\n",
      "Error . Do you want to discuss the recipe?\n",
      "Error . I suppose you could use that. I-.\n",
      "Error . And I need to slice this ball around here. I naturally slice anyway. Now the ball will go straight. And I go.\n",
      "Error . You might generate some interest in it.\n",
      "Error . I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin.\n",
      "Error . So what was the last car repair you had?\n",
      "Error . I know living in Dallas we've got bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic. And that was horrible.\n",
      "Error . Plus if something goes wrong I know who to blame.\n",
      "Error . I think the first thing they said I have written this down. So it would. Do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government?\n",
      "Error . But I think maybe a lot of them. The more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while I'm in office.\n",
      "Error . On the broad scope it had a much bigger. Meaning to me. About just the meaning of the freedom of this country and what that really meant.\n",
      "Error . A lot of the older family lives in Vernon.\n",
      "Error . It was really nice speaking to you. It was good to speak with you too.\n",
      "Error . They'll probably be pretty good. Course the Celtics are always really good too with their players.\n",
      "Error . I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight.\n",
      "Error . But that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate.\n",
      "Error . Have we spent our at least five minutes?\n",
      "Error . We're talking about capital punishment.\n",
      "Error . Do you have any pets?\n",
      "Error . So I just go. We have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen. And I've just got three trash cans sitting in there. We just kind of dump things in each one if we get them.\n",
      "Error . So tell me about.\n",
      "Error . I talked with people from Richardson and Plano. And the first three days. And then yesterday I talked with someone from Pennsylvania. So.\n",
      "Error . If I have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while.\n",
      "Error . So.\n",
      "Error . What you mean my voice?\n",
      "Error . Perennial.\n",
      "Error . And that is what is scary. And I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from. Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes. And they really can not afford the best.\n",
      "Error . And then they could have done that well at home.\n",
      "Error . This was a really neat vital woman. And you get in a nursing home. And the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life.\n",
      "Error . I really. I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care. You would do your research. And you would go visit.\n",
      "Error . Why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you.\n",
      "Error . We're going to talk about our lawn and garden chores. Do you have either one?\n",
      "Error . My mother.\n",
      "Error . Wouldn't that be awful if you were using and lose your job and everything.\n",
      "Error . He does have some real bizarre things I think.\n",
      "Error . This has been an interesting thing to do. Have you made a lot of calls. Or.\n",
      "Error . I'm back.\n",
      "Error . When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell? It would depend on when you go. It's not excessively crowded on the weekends.\n",
      "Error . Do you live in a home?\n",
      "Error . How about yours?\n",
      "Error . And stuff like that. That's not really hard rock.\n",
      "Error . And it kind of has to start from the top or from the bottom maybe and go clear up. People.\n",
      "Error . But if it doesn't start at home it's not going to go anywhere.\n",
      "Error . It's just that. It's just that the rating system seems instead of having X now they have N C seventeen?\n",
      "Error . Because I didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt.\n",
      "Error . It's kind of irritating. But it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls.\n",
      "Error . This is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool. And they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds. And they have BIBLE lessons. And they have all the things during the morning. But they still have snack time and play time. So I'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and T-shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just tennis shoes and play clothes.\n",
      "Error . And I don't mind. At first it was the little extra money that you got returning the cans in and stuff like that.\n",
      "Error . Plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also. Do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags?\n",
      "Error . How are you?\n",
      "Error . That. We're supposed to appreciate them. When I come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door. I don't know that a cat would do that.\n",
      "Error . If I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours because I was going out. She would break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did.\n",
      "Error . At lea-.\n",
      "Error . Which it's not that way now. But I think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around.\n",
      "Error . What do you think about it?\n",
      "Error . He's not the liability that he was that he used to be.\n",
      "Error . We have recently started a bin program here in Plano where.\n",
      "Error . He got a little mulcher thing.\n",
      "Error . And do you have to sort that?\n",
      "Error . I've never.\n",
      "Error . I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years our total tax burden despite tax cuts.\n",
      "Error . I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom.\n",
      "Error . I forgot the name of the town. I thought maybe it was you.\n",
      "Error . But now I don't know. But let's see. When I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean.\n",
      "Error . And we have enough clouds that there are other areas that would be better suited. That surprised me because I think we have a tremendous amount of sunny days.\n",
      "Error . So it's. Anyway so maybe within a year we will see how that falls.\n",
      "Error . I don't think I'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly. But.\n",
      "Error . Like I was saying Burlington's crime it doesn't involve children. And what you see on the T V -s in Washington and New York. So what I believe the people want. The subject is big city crime which is something that I don't have any first hand experiences about. But I have concerns. And I have a few ideas of how to combat it.\n",
      "Error . They have bottle drives. They have cleanup outings. And they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer. And they have gyms open. And it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them.\n",
      "Error . How do you just figure.\n",
      "Error . I'll let you start. Do you all keep a budget. And how do you hold to yours?\n",
      "Error . Do you own a P C by the way? I'm guessing you probably do.\n",
      "Error . And then when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with seafood?\n",
      "Error . So my buddy and I we just camped.\n",
      "Error . Let's see. We keep our paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and plastics. And we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full. I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable.\n",
      "Error . But I know we had a problem down here with people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the drain sewer.\n",
      "Error . I really wanted to do. So many of them now have the ribbons where I'm not sure how they do it. But the ribbons they make them they. I don't know how to explain it. They make them hard?\n",

      "Steve with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them. Or what do you think? <SEP> That's a really hard question. I do know that politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths. I. Let's example. Our friend the President right now says no new taxes. We should be cutting taxes now because of the recession. And at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases. So I know the politicians aren't straightforward. In terms of economics I'm not. It's hard to call. It really is. I never really thought that the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little. I always that the real question is are we getting a reasonable return on investment. For instance like Social Security tax or Soc-. That's tax. We're paying money. And supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us. <SEP> So that's. When I see that money taken out of my paycheck or every other week I really think that money's history. And as far as return investment that's nothing. <SEP> And we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back. Someone was telling me that there's still an office staffed with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio which. I may be wrong. But I believe that the cure for polio is already founded. But supposedly once you have an office in D C and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down. And they just haven't yet. <SEP> I'm not exactly sure about polio in particular. I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio. <SEP> I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. That might be the difference. I don't know. The other thing that I remember seeing on T V lately had to do with. It's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically. <SEP> For some reason historical sites with the full federal money and everything seem to appear almost as political favors to very strong politicians. <SEP> It's funny because it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where Congress is able to attach all kinds of funny amendments for individual congressional districts to the main budget proposals. <SEP> And the poor President has to either accept or reject the whole thing. It sounds like you think that we'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto. <SEP> <SEP> I think the line item veto is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the President uses it to get rid of this kind of waste. On the other hand it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. And just to get rid of the unimportant things. <SEP> And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to where the boundary between waste and necessity is. <SEP> So I'm not sure that that will help solve our problems. But there definitely is a problem with. I forgot. There's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something. <SEP> Pork barrel politics. <SEP> Pork barrel politics. There has to be some way to do it. I know state governors usually have line item vetos. And I lived in Massachusetts for a while. And when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. But Massachusetts when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially. <SEP> D-. At least at the end. I don't know. I. <SEP> They were very good at first. They were in very good financials at first. And that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well. And then of course the bottom fell out. It's tough. There's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations. I guess you can raise taxes and then create job programs and whatnot. Or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot. <SEP> And spare the economy. It's a hard balance. It definitely is. Even not for government even just for a small business. I know some.\n",
      "Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them. Or or or what do you think? <SEP> Well that's that's a really hard question. I do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths. Uh I. Let's example uh. Our friend the President right now says no new taxes. We should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession. And at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases. So uh I know the politicians uh aren't aren't straightforward. Now i- in terms of economics I'm not. It's hard hard to call. It really is. Uh-huh. See I never thought really it's uh I never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little. I I always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment. For instance like Social Security tax or Soc- uh. I mean that's that's tax. We're paying money. And and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us. <SEP> Right. So that's. Yeah you know. When I when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week I or each every other week I I really think that money's history. And you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing. <SEP> Yes uh. And we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back. Uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio which. I may be wrong. But I believe that the cure for polio is already founded. But but supposedly once you have an office in D C or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down. And and they just haven't yet. <SEP> Well yeah. I'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular. I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio. Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. Well that might be the difference. I don't know. Uh the other thing that uh I remember seeing on T V lately is uh had to do with. It's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically. <SEP> Right. That that histor- for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians. <SEP> Yeah. It's it's it's funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh c- congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals. Uh-huh. <SEP> And the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing. So it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto. <SEP> Oh. <SEP> I I think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste. On the other hand uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. Uh and just to get rid of the unimportant things. Yeah. <SEP> And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exa- where the boundary between waste and and necessity is. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I'm not I'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems. But there definitely is is a problem with. Uh I forgot. There's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something. Yeah. <SEP> Uh. Pork barrel politics. <SEP> Pork barrel politics. The- the- there has to be some way to do it. I know state governors usually have line item vetos. And uh I lived in Massachusetts for a while. And uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. Yeah. But Massachusetts wasn't when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially. <SEP> D-. At least at the end. Uh-huh. I mean I don't know. I. <SEP> Yeah. I- i- they were very good at first. They were in very good financials at first. And uh that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well. And then of course the bottom fell out. It's uh I mean it's it's tough. I mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations. I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot. Or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot. <SEP> And spare the economy. Yeah. It's really it's a hard balance. It it definitely is. Even not for government even just say for a small business. Uh I know some.\n",
