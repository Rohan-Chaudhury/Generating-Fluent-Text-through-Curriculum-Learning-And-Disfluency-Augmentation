on the other we have the flagwavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material willynilly unfortunately few of the artists who have used american folklore since have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways
stephen vincent benets john browns body comes immediately to mind in this connection as does john steinbecks the grapes of wrath and carl sandburgs the people the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass should be used frequently

this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck pressed on the upper lip or inserted into the nostril nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patients neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life

these two basic malformations have of course many variations a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw crooked overlapping twisted or widely spaced teeth front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close the eyeteeth beginning to protrude like fangs second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out making a double row

men even men like stanley are unpredictable she tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they werent so many after all

on her bureau lay a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving an object which had been the property of her greatgrandfather major hiram munroe culver he had belonged to this land and perhaps had desecrated it and this was the only material symbol that remained of him

these little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep but he couldnt appear as a composer now

the persistent horror of having a malformed child has been reduced not because we have gained any control over this misfortune but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it in fact the recent warnings about the use of xrays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance science has momentarily aggravated our fears

the finished product would begin with a hazy longshot of joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pools surface clad in layers of lavender lather and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap even to clean men and boys joyce went on when wed finished lou mr thor asked me to stay a little longer he didnt did I mean
anyway it was evident what he had in mind you got away didnt you
he caught up with me once and grabbed me but I was all covered with zing its very slippery I didnt know
the keys were still in it and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where id changed shed driven around for a while then thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that time shed gone back to his home on bryn mawr drive parked in front and walked toward the pool

as you have doubtless guessed already the plot is plastered with freudian jungian and meinckian theory for example when the film is only four minutes old neitzbohr refers to a small victorian piano stool as wilhelmina and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name of course was doris
as we find out at the end it is not the stool that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind when the slat finally shatters we see him count the fragments all the while muttering he loves me he loves me not
not only was haumds intonation and phrasing without flaw but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride for example to move from the lowest fmajor register up to a barely audible n minor in four seconds not skipping at the same time even one of the fingerings seems a feat too absurd to consider and it is to the flautists credit that he remained silent throughout the passage
for the last two years this frontier of the arts has produced a number of socalled nondramas which have left indelible bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer the latest and greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the an adaptation of bashos classic froghaiku by roger entwhistle a former university of maryland chemistry instructor
although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention the action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee
leaving the theatre after the performance I had a flash of intuition that life after all is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude the story of a nymphomaniac triphammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middleaged steam shovel

doctor lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes then by squeezing her foot three times he came up with a different diagnosis with each squeeze
she had kidney trouble liver trouble and a severe female disorder he knew just the thing for her a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator machine
as he applied the applicator extending from the machine which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base to the supposedly diseased portions of mrs shaefers body lee kept up a steady stream of pseudoscientific mumbojumbo the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything he assured her
she know why the colors of the tubes were important to peoples health the human body required units of blue light
for that reason the lord made the sky blue continuing glibly in this vein he paused to comfort her dont you worry
as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about I once used this machine to cure a woman with pounds of cancer in her body

he made a sound of despair deep in his throat it was embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen

in the hut to which I was assigned my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases her name was lturu and she told me many things
for an anthropologist loquacious old lturu was a mine of information though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women
from lturu I heard that until about the people of this island had been of both sexes and that the normal family life of melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations in the middle of the last century an island woman named karipo seized a spear in the heat of an intertribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled
she cackled with mirth showing the stumps of betelstained teeth karipos women then named this place eromonga for just the strongest men could stay here
dont forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling reminded him with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldnt be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation
and a pane of glass isnt hard to the telephone interrupted him he scooped up the receiver and said police chief into the mouthpiece and then mr benson
I was hoping id hear from you today with his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying and I see at intervals
at last he said thank you for calling mr benson although there was no doubt in my mind and weve been handling it as one im glad to have it made official he paused thats about it the time of death
the duration of the digestive process varies but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that mrs meeker died several hours after her sevenoclock dinner probably around midnight give or take an hour either way pauling paused again
however likely it was he couldnt limit himself to it he had to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to johnston came to light
garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would not have ever come about if mrs meeker had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement
she in the habit of making new wills she had reason to change the one she made right after mr meekers death
a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflected tenure too very nice for him he went on to personal bequests a list of names largely unknown to him twentyfive thousand to each of the greatnieces in oregon ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars to the pecks ten thousand each to joan sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in mrs meekers employ at the time of the latters death
she had a number of them where money was concerned garth said sometimes wed have trouble persuading her to make taxexempt charitable contributions and ive known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet the next moment shed put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston affair
his expenses ran another four or five thousand the lawyer didnt know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party and found him easy enough to talk to
the whole thing was so far outside the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug no doubt mrs meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing
even so maddens dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened it would be all right with him if his investigation of the fraud with its probable byproduct of murder led to garths door motive tenthousanddollar bequest
airy and bright the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture rugs and draperies done by a professional decorator and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable as its occupant
however by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines and better yet whether he has a taste for wine again by spreading ones purchases over several wine dealers one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad
the drinking of wine is for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the supply would dry up in no time at all this is the only valid and extenuating argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter
a really good wine waiter is paradoxically the guardian of his cellar against the visigoths faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence
too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it if it smells of wine the bottle is probably all right if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion
a white wine already at cool cellar temperature may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator in about fifteen minutes for those who live in a winter climate there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow though by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time
it may be a bit cold when poured but again as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should be served in a large tulipshaped glass which is never filled more than half full in this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages
by tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well thus red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself
he cleared his throat and wet his lips as cheerfully as possible he said I guess we could all do with a little drink

moreover nursing various stubblefields her aunt then her mother then her father through their lengthy illnesses theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot england france germany switzerland and italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes
she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george george when he had written had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin elecs funeral
his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for his grandchildren he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand poor george the only boy the family darling together with her mother both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong
theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george it just be that anne had understood only too well and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull
he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped in his bathrobe on a footstool he held his long clenched foot in both hands and this and his contorted face made him look like a large skinny old monkey
of course there are practical problems to be considered cousin emma is alone in that big old house and wont hear to parting from it
I really shouldnt have smoked a cigarette so early in the day it always makes me sick ill start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps no said theresa she said
the trouble is that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow

in a growing number of american homes the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships it is she who decides the time the place the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act
of course there remain many oldfashioned marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy yet even in these marriages wives are asserting themselves more strongly
when the roles of husband and wife are reversed so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower the effects on their whole relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous in one extreme case cited by a pittsburgh psychologist an office workers wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded
the wifes attempt at control is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative
the pattern is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night no one seriously contends of course that the domineering wife is sexually speaking a new character in our world
furthermore a certain number of docile retiring men always have been around they arent frigid and they arent homosexual theyre just restrained in all of life
grandma wasnt expected to like it dr marion hilliard the late toronto gynecologist once summed up the attitude of thes wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as used by their husbands and they often quite literally were
very few wives who balance the checkbook fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well
according to dr ellis the average yearold american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner not surprisingly some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities
when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wifes aggressiveness the wife in turn finds him inadequate often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction
one such wife became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man or his wife because he or she feels age creeping up on the other hand a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive asking for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable
a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted flattered or coaxed simply because she needs her ego lifted in any case such problems are a couples own affair and cant always be measured by a general yardstick
to get a marriage back where it belongs the husband must take some very basic steps he must begin paradoxically by becoming more selfish
he must become more expressive of his own desires more demanding and less understanding too many husbands worry about how well theyre doing and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play

the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time for that purpose first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen
the hymen is in essence a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin during the same examination two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall without any pain and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times
many years later lucy upton wrote winslows daughter soon to be graduated from smith college while I love botany which after dabbling in for years I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being that was my favorite study
she read maitlands dark ages which I enjoyed very much la croix on the customs of the middle ages chapters of bryce more chapters of guizot lecky and stanleys eastern church she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone
their house was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer especially grateful to one like myself far from home lucy was a lively part of the household
she had taught classes in botany astronomy geometry and psychology miss upton and miss packard as a matter of fact had many tastes in common yet they thrived on it at the fifteenth anniversary as already quoted miss upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future as a college of first rank with expanding and unlimited horizons
when dr wallace buttrick wise in his judgment of people declined to have the science building named for him he wrote miss tapley if you had asked me I think I would have suggested that you name the building for miss upton her services to the school for many years were of a very high character and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her
the daughters of spelman had never known or thought of spelman without her the removal of miss packard years earlier had caused them great sorrow but they still had miss giles

there was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received it was always the same unqualified success now he could no longer build anything without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other values
sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved it all seemed as though this brokennosed man with the muscular arms and wrestlers neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the bosss work
he did not notice and was already backing the car down to the road saying to the stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed she stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road
he looked at her out of himself as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotinechoked lungs the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the tate gallery on a thursday once now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said once more and roared off into the fog his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator just as his hand did when he worked
every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things stowey was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and nothing was burning on the stove and lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes

she could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car but she couldnt understand their subsequent actions it because she had shown panic

it was as if foreign duty implied and excused license it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it and therefore why not then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different

most of their original objections about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous bodies were mercifully concealed helvas class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program
what a lovely voice you have said one of the female visitors helva looked up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface
we have quite a few years of voice training madam remarked helva calmly vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intrastellar distances and must be eliminated
I am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw I say the lady twittered
the ladys eyes unmagnified bugged out I forget and helvas voice was really contrite
in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread

reverend I think you dont quite understand the situation here you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church tenements stores saloons some gambling
if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years by that time perhaps something better can be done I dont I was just asking about it
the part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate it could have been like that for only a little while but true memory does not count nor add it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time once then my world was bound round by fences when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough to twist my knee over it and pull myself up
my greatgrandmother made her garden her great pride she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wallflowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house these my grandmother left in their places and planted others like them that flourished without careful tending
in one of these were notes on the identities of the eightyone refugees the method of destroying the evidence embarrassed paul bangjensen
he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence he was right and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordiers words on the subject it seemed as good a place as any to do the job
the result was the gross report prepared by gross as chairman with the assistance of two un under secretaries constantin stavropoulos and philippe de seynes yes bangjensen was an upandcoming young man
you know its difficult to talk like this about a man who cant answer back gross was behind a cleantop desk only a manila folder before him
gross swung his swivel chair how could that have been
as a matter of fact ive looked through backissue files of new york papers for december and havent found a great deal gross shot another look at marshall it wasnt necessarily all here in new york
mick shann went over and over the report with alsing andersen trying to check them out even after the incident between bangjensen and shann in the delegates lounge and this was not the way the chicago tribune presented it gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings
after all this shann went over all that bangjensen had brought up shanns own report describes the encounter as immoderate
it sounded like a fair enough invitation and bangjensen must have thought so too because on the thirteenth he met the group of three on the thirtysixth floor of the un there ernest gross further assured him we were requested by the secretary general as I understand it to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat

when you marry you want to have things in common and its hard when you dont marry someone with your own background a fourteenyearold girl from the middle west observed wryly that in her community religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious
at the same time there is a good deal of selfcongratulation at attending a good college and they express pleasure at the cozy ingroup feeling that the college generates its people of your own kind a girl remarked
almost everybody in the senior class is married students say dogmatically the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities sororities and houses that have good news to impart
how dared they demand to snoop in private financial records disbursements confidential contracts and agreements it is as though that man in the white house like some despot of yore insisted on reading my diary raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie the litigation was costly and seemingly endless I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the supreme court mr roosevelt and his henchmen had done their dirty work all too well even going so far as to attempt to pack the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me
again my name was on all the front pages I was persona non grata in every quarter but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence
my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as reactionary robber baroness and even traitor traitor I point now with pride to the fact that long ere the committee on unamerican activities the minute women the economic council and other such notable watchdog organizations were so much as heard of I was hollywoods leading bulwark against communism fighting singlehandedly creeping socialism against such insuperable odds as the fasciocommunist troops of the nra pwa wpa ccc and an army of more than twentytwo million mercenaries whom fdr employed secretly through the transparent ruse of regular relief checks
I tried my hardest with little help from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside pressures were too severe having achieved stardom a fortune and a worldrenowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote letch proceeded to neglect them all
never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw as for his private monies they were rapidly dissipated in drinking gaming and carousing
youre too old was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested starting a family letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter
I now felt it wiser to keep babydear in school and at a camp run by the society of friends all year around her presence only made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau belletch I had neglected to consider a room for babydear so there was no place to put her anyhow
it was small consolation in a rare fit of anger and spite I farmed out my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment
it was a potboiler made on a shoestring and not the sort of film I like as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal my heart was not in it but oddly enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my career
there were times it wasnt right to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we dont keep peanut butter for a peanut butter sandwich you in this house he always told her winston I just now saw you eating it out of the jar
her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool whats these dishes doing not washed
this is moving day and I bet you left things every which way upstairs your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made leona his eye had fastened on her leg bending he touched her knee if I catch you one more time down here without stockings she twitched her leg away
winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron carefully he undid the bow I dont want to leave here winston listen to that
she was too young too young and thin and straight winston it was mr jack bellowing out in the hall
winston mr jack said giving a final set to his hat look out for those movers
winston get the basket for the breakables winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall
frowning miss ada studied the list lets see the china lemon tree the alabaster cockatoo
hes used it every day every morning I lay out his clothes on it thats over now
winston laid it in the basket mr jack sets store by that winston
ill give you a medical certificate framed if you like miss ada had said all I want is a picture with a few lines
into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta as every artist delights to do wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and into the relations of men and women in their relations she was the giver and he the receiver nay the demander his feeling always exacted sacrifices from her
one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as highspirited and opinionated as herself she could not resist the opportunity of showing her superiority in argument over a man which she had remarked as one of the feminine follies of sara sullam and in her forthright way henrietta who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness to think of men as the privileged and women as submissive and yielding felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception until once in sheer desperation he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything
she wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments like what fun a comedy in three acts in which under personages henrietta appeared as a schoolmarm and bertha who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta had been appeared as dummkopf sadie studied piano played chopin in the soiree musicale of mr guthries pupils and she recited hectors farewell to andromache most movingly to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown near philadelphia where the szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds in baltimore
adele like amy the youngest of the marches was the rebellious mischievous rather calculating and ambitious one for rachel conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls there was no particular march counterpart but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content the one being definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian
on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story it was of course a little boys fantasy of winning his mother to himself and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted but if it were only this the story would be banal
the rocking is actually felt in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy the rocking is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a childs fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present it conceals and yet is suggestive a perfect symbol
he opened the myth book again and there were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilders address the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer
would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had found his first night in one of walters marked bars nicolas look nicolas doesnt go to bed with boys no sex see if all these beers was to get me in bed you just spent a lot of money ballet dancer protests tears and take what you want nicolas I am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful
to this meek conjugation nicolas had replied I can use this blanket when you get off this job tonight you can gim me something to eat
she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens dear girl he writes me that he is sleeping in the english gardens
how like him mary jane had smilingly said his address is that great foundling home the american express
his presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live with the angels she set down her suitcase
she wake him smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched
a young american has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once and then we shall see
in the small gallery used as the guests dining room meredith sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young waitress he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets when he saw the grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table
it would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he dropped his napkin so startled was he by mary janes beauty yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the grafin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special
mary jane had made very little effort above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with no brassiere beneath
as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank you for the use of your bath spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control meredith began falling in love soup only this morning veal cutlets I couldnt possibly eat all this wine then you were typing poems this afternoon fruit compote if you think I would understand it a smile what a beautiful room like as if it were built of books
I think the maids tipple in the afternoon those sweet girls youre joking
the husband points the steps out with his flashlight its white stare filling her pale eyes to the blind brim with appetite bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak all night he read on
mary jane took the page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words its that myth about orpheus and what is her name
she began to explain there was this poet in italy he interrupted dont judge all poets
what I mean is he was a pole and the greatest soldier in the ulanys sir the men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name
since the war I have seen the way the germans have behaved and I think we have behaved like this for hundreds of years why how can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see
dont go inside majdanek im still a soldier in a very small way styka
I dont know if I can get you into the inner camp maybe maybe but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl

I wish they could write nigger pussy he thought of sweet wet nigger pussy
haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy he thought of her the first one
he had caught her coming out of the shack she was a juicy one how they bounced
fresh warm sweet and juicy sweet lovin sixteen she was how I love nigger pussy the snow came a little faster now he noted
he thought of joe harris the nigger who had gone after his sister he chuckled the memory vivid we fixed him we fixed him the snow again
the fucken weather wasnt so lousy niggers what I have to put up with I cant figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for
his thoughts turned to other things the big shock everybody had when they found ol slater and those others done for for
I told him I told him he said aloud theyll get the guys that done it
there was something troubling him though as yet they hadnt five days prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him
four cuts at least and I owe it all to them the word also made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled
one day ching had told him as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders keep it up your squad is good one of the best keep it up keep up the good work he would
theyll get them by god and let them bring them down here to me just let them ill slice their balls right off his arm moved swiftly violently once twice

he was again tingling with pleasure seeing himself clearly in slaters shoes top dog sleeping and eating right there with the staff ching tien all of them top dog poor ol slater imagine the crummy bastards theyll get em theyll get whats comin to em he whirled about suddenly thats the way theyll toe the line

why do you say that I asked I was full of booze and a drunk is apt to do anything he says hell do nonsense
when I think of people like you I you what mary jane you are young intelligent have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself but you mess it up with whiskey indifference selfdestructive attitudes
she was very pretty you dont believe that im going back to medical school and finish do you
how would you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get through at hanover if I thought you were serious about going back to school that youd learned something from your experiences here and at hanover I might consider such an offer what about that girl you were going to kill
it suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane brennan should know the truth about me that I was not the confused sick irresponsible person she believed me to be there are things about me that I cannt tell you now mary jane but if youll go out to dinner with me when I get out of hanover id like to tell you the whole story
you will get to come home on long weekends from hanover wont you ill get one overnight a month
I smiled youll send the rollsroyce of course of course mr nelson
they all bowed low as I approached them all right you bastards the great actor is about to buy a drink
in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors a point like f in figure would be the dwelling place for the community leader while e and h would house the next most important citizens a point like p gets information directly from n but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n
even the officer in charge is restrained by monitoring this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility
shes got more guts than any other woman in the world keith keith you were wonderful
were all gods creatures arent we penny all of us except me you hate me you hate my guts because I like to hunt
you actually hate me because I killed that filthy snake why dont you say something
he knew how to shoot down nazis he knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else because he was chemically incapable of fear
they grounded him and put him in the command offices that was where he met penny
he was aware of her as a frightfully goodlooking american wac a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work in the command offices but that was all penny knew him better on her part
he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so but because he enjoys his work because he firmly believes that murder must be punished thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman
the rise of the giant corporations in western europe and the united states dates from the period although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as balzac dickens and poe it was not until the closing decades of the th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction
it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial and not the nazi regime alone but antisemitism throughout history how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews without being an antisemite contribute to a verdict against antisemitism
shout at eichmann though he might the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of antisemitism he believed that the jews were enemies of the reich and such a belief is of course typical of patriotic antisemites but he believed in the jewasenemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things
perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer not through fear of disobeying orders but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a halfacceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitlers victories into a permanent lightmindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal lets try it at any rate the substance of eichmanns testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the ss and though the prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews his success on this score was doubtful and the antisemitic lesson weakened to that extent
this meaning of eichmanns experience in various countries worth highlighting as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete
I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy I told him at which he started slightly and then made us each a stiff drink with a trembling hand I seem to remember that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live
the zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a march hare it is manic as a man I woke up this morning paraphrasing lewis carroll
just barely he said and repeated his paraphrase the time has come to speak of manic things of shots and shouts and sealing dooms of commoners and kings moreland fixed us each another drink and said for gods sake tell me something truly amusing

I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance recently by the way I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was noninstitutionalized
that is demonstrable I told him you remember the woman in the french alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously
she told the sheep the world is coming to an end the sheep said all in unison I have no doubt
if you saw the drama called rhinoceros think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros the rhinos would panic screaming help if that can be screamed in their language
you think the russians are getting ahead of us in comedy moreland demanded I said
such as moreland asked such as sending the cat to guard the mice or the falcon to protect the dove or the human being to save humanity you and I have fallen out of literature into politics moreland observed
the world that was once footloose and fancyfree has now become screwloose and frenzyfree in our age of science and angst it seems to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space
the human ego being what it is science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tubenosed fruit bats it seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species
forty years ago an english writer wl george dealt with this subject in eddies of the day and said as an example that saint george for merry england would not start a spirit half so quickly as strike frogeating frenchmen dead there was also gott strafe angleterre and carthago delenda est or deus strafe carthage
the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity and in particular that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states I speak of the largest possible measure because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved ever reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings and is therefore a dangerous man to have around assumption
it may be of course that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world the absence of soviet communist power the uses of power this much having been said the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do defeat communism and how those resources ought to be used
I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment but you know any comparison of overall american strength with overall soviet strength finds the united states not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of ussoviet relations for the foreseeable future
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts and I think mr jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth suppose that the tables were turned and we were in the soviets position there would be more than modern soviet fighters all better than ours stationed at bases in mexico and the caribbean
this ignorant estimate is not of any interest in itself but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do namely by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side to the extent then that declining us prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation there is reason for concern
still these guesses about the outcome of the struggle can not be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power about which the relevant questions are is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence communist political warfare is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages
today africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging into the soviet orbit latin america was once an area as safe for the west as nebraska was for nixon
if I ever committed suicide I would dive straight down from here and no one would find me for days she smiled and expertly let herself downward holding this known root or that her sneakers sliding in the leaves
julie how are you then off he went so casually to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a lowercut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him
I wish he was with me now and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment I wish I were older or younger julia bentley thought
lets put the show on the road he was walking across to the bathroom
he recognized his jacket and trousers the fabric was dark the stains werent too apparent and there were his shoes but his shirt was one terrible mess
he was trying to smile at her you shouldnt be up should you
I was just leaving here julie im all set just about to call a taxi
at least you wont have to do that she was saying im about to leave myself
im just finishing breakfast but have you told mother you were going she asked him
wont you come in then have a cup of coffee or something or maybe a drink she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate and yet perhaps partly scornful
he tried to see her face more clearly nothing at all he said after a moments hesitation
as a great favor julie dont mention youve seen me not to anyone ill call your mother as soon as I get home you just go ahead she had disappeared
I wish I wasnt wearing this ridiculous costume and that we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we knew he stopped speaking forget we ever knew what just sort of everything in general she said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace
I know you feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say does it he asked perhaps
there was the key are you positive youll be all right by yourself she asked him
for a moment he smiled julie dear youve done me the greatest possible service
someone shouted at him will you look at george rawlings what happened to you

ill take you out to dinner he had put down the receiver a strange relationship between joan fulbright and himself
he came by and repeated po chavis chapter startled him awake
the room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it a dull boom and a throbbing echo the walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled
he stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon he raced to the window and yanked at the sash
the wood was old the paint alligatored a fresh breeze saluted him six oclock

the way macarthur said his line if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist would probably have gone like this afj primary stresses on emeralds and wish note pitch on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl one degree of oversoftness conclusions the people involved knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds both monetary and sentimental the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture

he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer had participated in one or two battles and at the age of twentyfive quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a christian rector was often curious often tempted to ask questions but he never did
he was even more startled when he heard what kayabashi wanted the oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi wished to show them the mission
rector laughed despite himself unless the oyabun has been working on it he said then checked himself and added you can tell kayabashisan that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use
at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived
fifteen she said only fourteen the little ito girl had had to go home
sir johnson said you are about to become a firstclass surveyor rector said
somehow managing to get out a cool poised wont you hold on a second I covered up the mouthpiece and with more warmth and less poise gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter including devils island and the remoter reaches of siberia I promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed
it seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace and quiet instead of carrying out my threats resolving to get something done I started in on the dishes
they had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners and for information as to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter to call they were personalities
herb an expert on narrow ties thin lapels and swatches was mens fashion editor of parvenu the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from nebraska
she was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile then put some money into a broadway show which was successful
it was during her writing period that she and herb met and decided that they were in love they were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda not bermuda
they had bought their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding new york they had chosen catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names you are bound to get involved with people when you have children so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands but people who do things
I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldnt escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things their house was a centuriesold colonial which they had had restored and updated and added on to
it had a gourmets corner a breakfast room a luncheon room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud it was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room paint in the painting room play with blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time
their two boys were well adjusted and like their parents always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences francesca and herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects
blanche was very very sweet being in her company was like being drowned in warm melted marshmallows I had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness my souffle has collapsed
anyone knows how a real redblooded woman would react to such a catastrophe if blanche had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of doors and thrown a few little valueless things but not blanche
each had developed a hairtrigger chuckle and the habit of saying in deference to countrysquirehood I never thought id live to hear people chuckle and say in real life
they were always leaping to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves sanitary bake shops pioneers I thought and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier pioneers who looked like offduty gardeners even at parentteacher conferences and who never called the school principal mister
I sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ u yearly people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on person to person people who thought it was nice to be important but not important to be nice who were more ingratiating than gracious more personalities than persons in my estimation they were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka not discussed him exactly but said kafka reverently and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about kafka not having read kafka
they were people invariably trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine what not who others were becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime I brought myself back to the tasks at hand
I dug around and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a devilsfood cake with chocolate icing the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing
she was most strange woman ready to follow her impulse it was an impulse when she was here in mea shearim that led her to stay in israel
then his son did something to an official here it was during the mandate and the son was imprisoned a few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed
in fact some sensitives rule this out preferring to consider their expression as strictly extrasensory perception on this side of the veil however that may be people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons
it is not really only a conversation many a sitter has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind
dr karlis osis director of research at the parapsychology foundation described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article he remarked it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter
if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name he can not possibly give any clues conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions
sometimes in these experiments appointment sittings are used here the absent sitter makes a date with a communicator asking him to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for him
one sitter may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed to him to another it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase to get around this quite difficult corner there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him
after the sitting has been held several readings at one time are mailed and the distant sitter must mark each little item as correct incorrect doubtful or especially significant he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his
now when the cream has been skimmed off and the items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the sensitive is at her best mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses
I feel cold or my leg aches my head is heavy perhaps she hears words or sounds theres such a noise of loud machinery or I hear a child crying or he says were all here and glad to see you
it is still a college only and not a university it is in fact the only college in the ivy group however three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums the dartmouth medical school the thayer school of engineering and the amos tuck school of business administration
perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us the sleeping poet and in poets can discover their immortality is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul
in any case miss millays sweetthroated bitterness her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love her constant and wonderfully tragic posture so unlike that of fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props drew from the me that I was when I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea but all this is the bel canto of love and although I have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that I listened I know well enough that it was not
at the same time I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign since theirs is a science of paradox if one hates they say it is because one loves if one bullies they say it is because one is afraid if one shuns they say it is because one desires and according to them whatever one fancies one feels what one feels in fact is the opposite normally abnormal or normally normal neurotic or merely fastidious I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion
I fled however not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which I had already insisted upon finding out for myself despite the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle yes on principle and in cold blood because I was resolved as a modern woman not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize life by the throat I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of selfbetrayal
however I confess my hope that I will be innocent again not with a pristine accidental innocence but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone innocence of all the graces of the spirit is the one most to be prayed for
although it is constantly made to look foolish too simple to come in out of the rain it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best and when they seem worst it overlooks them
when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust innocence can falter since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it the innocence of which I speak is not incorruptible
here if anywhere it is not wholly incontrovertible to you for instance the word innocence in this connotation probably retained its biblical sense and therefore I suppose I must make myself quite clear by saying that I lost what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before I was legally entitled and in fact by oath required to hand it over along with what other goods and bads I had
I knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time I acquired it today these many years later after all the temptations resisted or yielded to the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured I call it corrupting still you remained innocent in this sense until the end
moreover because of the particular blot on your family escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your grandmothers part and because you had the leanto kitchen and trundle bed of your childhood to outgrow what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person what you bent your whole will sensibility and intelligence upon was to be a lady before being daughter wife or mother before being cultured before being sorry for the poor progressive about public health and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian indeed first and foremost you were a lady
there was of course more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your minds eye than the sine qua non of her virtue a lady never raised her voice or slumped in her chair never failed in social tact never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture never indulged in public scenes or private confidences never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering never gossiped or maligned never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself
just you all the time sometimes I think its the only way ill ever get a decent partner ramey smiled but he thought to himself I always see me too never benny
step back the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him
the child was gone when juanita awoke kate was still rocking the dead child still crooning in disbelief
the men were restive ready to take the battle to the enemy as jackson wished the peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in wheeling which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors
after he had gone kate asked uncle randolph proudly would you take their oath the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said I think ive taken it about fifty times already winking at joels look of shock
her mother wrote kate of her grief at the death of kates baby and at jonathans decision to go with the south and dear kate poor dr breckenridges son robert is now organizing a militia company to go south to his good fathers sorrow maj anderson of fort sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the us army
its your decision said juanita holding her face very still trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly the decision is yours
your evening free madame I said with noblesse oblige because of the handsome
I had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils then switched to tuborg after a few hours life hadnt showed and I was crocked
I didnt have on a hat hardly glancing at her I smiled a bleak one which said baby but id rather be alone
she must have seen the ring on my left hand women and unhappiness go together I observed profoundly adding you can wager your derriere on that
monsieur it is not my business to wager it this took me so funny I had to look at her
her eyes were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them isnt it better to smile she asked

henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense rests the tissues and pacifies the system
she had not come back to great island to be understood praised or condemned she had come to make her peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow
if it aint an idea how comes it you can drink beer but not water he looked piously to heaven and said beer dont affect the tissues none and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence
the woman answered the nod with her own god rest her soul she was a sweet one
come on she put a strong hand under the old mans arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old
she felt mindless walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named dorothy tredding seemed suddenly impossible
seven hundred miles south of york factory at the forks of the red and the assiniboine twentythree men located a settlement in august by october the little colony about fort douglas numbered
it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states in september at fort daer dickson met the noble lord whom with the help of a band of sioux he escorted to prairie du chien
this traffic tho it might be of small account at first would increase with the progress of our settlements the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected
in grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the forks and in december twenty men left fort daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien it was a threemonth journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on mackinac boats

he wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared at clayton in a childish kind of wonder you mean you want me to go with you wherever youre goin

gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely all my life I tried

mr rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one preferably one battered and worn such as might be found in a pawnshop they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller of sixth avenue
mr miller was in the shop but was reluctant to have anybodys picture taken inside because his business was too confidential for pictures but after introductions he asked carl sandburg you can pose inside
he wanted mr sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully kalamazoo guitars used by radio hillbilly singers he chose one from mr millers window a plain guitar with no fancy polish
one fame is precious and luminous another is a bubble of a bauble did you once see shelley plain

eugene was not entirely silent or openly rude unless asking harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness it went right on creaking under his own considerable weight and all it needed was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it
oh no harold said shocked this is france after all
I dont know what im going to do with you its because we are in france and know so few people

I did not perceive this essential distinction either firstborn I was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal nevertheless you were its agent
we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given his heart was pounding
though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us hesperus and lucifer show that we do
those could be commodities under this concept you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery
visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older this explained a great deal all the more reason then why we must have a treaty

japan has had destructive ones since the hawaiian islands are struck severely an average of once every years
in an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the inland sea one wave swamped more than ships and boats in osaka bay a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in washed away an entire town leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been
the waves are separated by intervals of minutes to an hour or more and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over the waves may keep coming for many hours
he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves their onrush and retreat was accompanied by a great hissing roaring and rattling
at that afternoon the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in honolulu the warning system immediately went into action
within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in alaska arizona and california the quakes epicenter was placed at degrees north latitude and degrees east longitude while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific the hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at greenwich time
the policemans eyes rather popped for a second but then arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasnt for these dear children the policeman got a confused funny look on his face and he had answered kind of politely look here lady I know you got to entertain these kids and all
this is a public park and its a city ordinance that the statues can not be crawled on arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said sir
then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous smile she would wink and throw kisses

I suppose you all were playing and forgot maam the children chorused heartily
he was forced to wipe his eyes you dont step on the flowers do you
we were coming to an intersection turning right chuffing to a stop forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old mexican moriarty new mexico
whiteshirted and conservativelycravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze suddenly a treble auto horn tootleytoottootled and thumbing hopefully I saw emergent in windshield flash red lips streaming silk of blonde hair and the leering face of old herry
moreeairteeeee he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde over the rapidlydiminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage herrys black brushcut was just discernible near or enviably near that spot where more delicatelytextured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes
damn his luck I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and at least I wouldnt have shouted back a taunt
how far I knew will shortly become apparent let me pass over the trip to sante fe with something of the same speed which made mrs roebuck wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit is still in eefaket
I let up on the accelerator only to gradually reach again the mph which would overhaul herry and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I mrs major roebuck settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody in sante fe when johnson ejaculated howsabout my buying us all a nice cold cocola maam mrs roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh a little younguh than you bawhs

the truck was hurtling forward I seized the rack and made a westernstyle flyingmount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and but this is no medical report
the way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke but he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear a beer I roared back between dusty lips I want a beer I nodded thats all right buddy the indian said
drink your beer miraculously the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my waterproof watch
I tossed the bottle high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the cars steel roof too high on unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash
the indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief the bottle this time went to the indians lips another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill
a workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didnt wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it mr mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and twobyfours which properly handled would turn into a workbench
he didnt know of any handymancarpenter there wasnt any such thing any more
we got to put in some outlets for them power tools then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an I guess were about through down here it all did look very efficient and shipshape

our objective is papasan there the objective sat brooding over all
if he were to go with white he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some point between here and papasan but moving ever deeper into enemy land itself this what he had expected
its safe and it provides cover for our noise soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night
and then the questions came eager interested questions and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity it ever bother you to have people always asking you about your hands
the french are a very curious people pierre had laughed they are also honest seekers after truth
the english are painfully silent about my missing hands they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there

I decided I hated the pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldnt watch dying just to entertain hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling hed not care about the pedersen kid
the covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but his face was turned to the wall there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster and I thought you dont look much like a pigdrunk bully now I couldnt be sure he was still asleep he was smart it put you off
pa was on his side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow get out of here get out of here big hans sent me he found the pedersen kid by the crib get out

hes an even bigger fool than you are fat I taught him and ill teach you out dont be smart you ask him about the whisky
get your pa and get that whisky pa dont care about the kid jorge

it should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for big hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with pas yellow sick insides you wont big hans said
hans if theyre needed ma said hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her
she had surprised hans like she had surprised me when she said shed go and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and hans was holding it angrily by the throat he was being queer and careful pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm
now hans had given ma something of his something valuable but since she didnt know wed given it to her there was no easy way of getting it back hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap
hans poured some in a tumbler you going to put more towels on him why not
big hans began pouring whisky in the kids mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin help me prop him up im lifting I took him by the shoulders
dont hold him like that put your arms around him jesus
like eliot in my fantasies I had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely continental I would lead jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently to the nights climax which in my dreams was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses burning with love the night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from the front nearly dying my head bandaged and blooded and jessica bending over me the power of her love bringing me back to life
in december I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the hotel astor a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated we would attend a film and later on we might go to the mayflower coffee shop or childs or toffenettis for waffles
ive known him quite a while she glanced at her companion fondly
havent I george ive been after her for years but ive never been able to get anywhere until the last few days
ill have to give it some thought he said you wouldnt want me to say without making sure his intentions are honorable would you
then as he turned toward the telephone it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly yeah he said casey tony calenda
calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his boys close at hand with my trial coming up in federal court next week I wouldnt want that picture published
he specifies in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism in every period it has been humanism and utopianism also
that john lockes philosophy of the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration of independence we generally accept after rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will the same philosophy became the idea source of the french revolution also
we of the liberalled world got all set for peace and rehabilitation then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight an irrational an indecent an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest and noblest ally
during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal during the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of containment and enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon the atom bomb
in the gop without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly all of this is recent history familiar to you
lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue and I select this sentence as its pertinent summation in essence the drama of his presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling thus far with but limited and precarious success to give effective voice and force to that conservatism
obviously there has been no agreement on what american conservatism is or rather what it should be it was neglected when the struggle began
one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election is that we the majority were dissatisfied with eisenhower conservatism we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment
let me add murrays new book as another symptom of it particularly so in view of the attention time magazine gave it when it came out recently father murray goes back to the declaration of independence too though with considerably more historical perception
I will reserve discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy as symptomatic of the common mans malaise he is most significant a liberal and a catholic elected by the skin of his teeth that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy state of the public mind
among them are frederick j hoffman william van oconnor and mrs olga vickery they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough in pointing out faulkners independence his questioning if not indeed challenging the southern tradition
that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions of course that he is steeped in them in fact or that he has dealt with them in his books it is to say rather that he has brought to bear on the history the traditions and the lore of his region a critical skeptical mind the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique
some of us might be inclined to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation either mental or physical are particularly southern traits there is no necessity to assert that mr faulkner is southern
a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region the planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton kennedy published swallowbarn in and in his genial portrait of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature
it would be profitable to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkners works the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time to faulkners time such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality in the south and moreover is following a longestablished literary precedent
the press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking rather than his convictions he commented that it was not too important for the individual how he ends up
the stiffly regal look of them lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string come down as soon as you conveniently can the upright letters stalked from the broadnibbed pen I have an important matter to discuss with you to abel I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here
I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters you may stay as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in to mark give my regards to myra
I remember that they came here every summer I used to play with the older one sometimes when hed let me abel
theres no greater catastrophe in the universe than the dwindling away of a family procreation expansion proliferation these are the laws of living things with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments oblivion
when the fate of the individual is visited on the group then then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth
she was the last living of the older generation what had once been a widespread family had now narrowed down to the two boys abel and mark
she didnt mention bringing myra mark said maneuvering the car into the next lane shes probably getting old and we figured better not
he said and he was without humor now ive had enough of that
they had almost everything they needed land a house two whiteface bulls three horses the land wasnt all wilson had expected of it six hundred and forty acres good grass good water
the grass was there though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it the water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard
the place had been cheap and it would serve its purpose there was only one place where jake carwoods description had gone badly awry the peace and quiet
it hadnt started out that way he had a feeling that things would get worse before they got better
there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble ill call her thank you
I have these appointments in town for saturday and ill probably spend sunday with dolly or the thaxters at last shes recovering her spirits
its so romantic up there with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night so poetic with all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock a misstep
I could tell them but no one ever asked why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body I forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened
if they say I could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of selfexamination her search into herself and its conclusions I had cried out that I knew shed do it but without my fully realizing it at the time it was a cry of triumph for her praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed and guilt
then via called to say they had decided to cremate her and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses I had ordered
I knelt just for decency but found myself whispering our father which art in heaven and it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief via was in the parking lot when I went outside
I wouldnt even be surprised if myra tried to leave her with us forever myra loved big cities thousands of miles away in paris of all places she might forget she had ever been a mother
lucy was sick of it at last she said because susan was clattering down the stairs
shell take every one of them jim groaned but he lifted susans suitcase and said in a gentler tone the entire thousand
at this point there should be a lecture on little cousins sharing dolls but she could sympathize with susan there ought to be a limit to sharing too that was one more reason she didnt look forward to cathys visit short or long the last one had been a lilliputian war
she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had lets get going dolls and all
lucy she said to herself abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds she had a day of things to do among them she had to prepare the guest room
ive been fixing up the guest room for cathy there was a momentary pause and then her mother said how long is she supposed to stay just for a couple of weeks till myra finds a place for them this time there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life
cathy was in tears of course and I heard myra say be good and at christmastime ill send you a wonderful present from paris shocked speechless lucy sat there
but the fats in the fire mike said theres no chance now of all of us getting away
mclish id be a mighty sad man if we never met again then he was on his way at a gallop
there may be a case of this sort but it is not one we wish to argue here even if people do in a not far distant future begin to read one anothers minds there will still be the question of whether what you find in another mans mind is especially worth reading worth more than what you can read in good books
each man is both one and many he is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time
mr lyford gives voice to a temper that represents an achieved plateau of reflective thinking after casting about for a way of describing this spirit we decided that it would be better to use mr lyfords introduction as an illustration
the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great and it does not escape the notice of others if our sincerity is granted the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest selfexamination
however we come finally to explain and account for the present the truth we are trying to expose right now is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises the host is the flowing life of the human race
we were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come very pure and elevated in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of instead of this thes witnessed a tragic economic depression the rise of fascist dictators in europe the wasting civil war in spain
he had taken out first papers for american citizenship but after war came to europe he decided to return to france arriving there in january I hated the war but thought I ought to go because I was perhaps one of those who hadnt done enough to prevent it
in the stalag helion came to know and love his comrades who in their extremity showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape
summers he said thoughtfully eagles nest ought to have a fire company
tell her to hurry sir his face pale summers headed for the street
that long ride the four of you took mustve given him a good appetite turn around so I can see your face jess stiffened I dont know nothin about him
so help me crouch id like to kill you where you stand but before I do im going to hear you admit killing him start talking
having all the guns makes you a big man dont it adams if we was both armed you wouldnt talk so tough all right crouch were on even terms draw
I aint a gunslinger youre the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club
louder said joyce I can hear you while im checkin the car
he waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her expectantly you goin to say somethin then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary silence maybe you could write it down for me
print it in real big letters an I can cipher it out later go on she said
he wore no gun a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country never had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun
neither was he very powerful of build he could move very quickly but he was more wiry than truly strong
I want him and im going to have him he caught her eye came back around the car with the bootwearer teetering halfmincing walk cut it out tom she snapped
are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk might get there faster walkin seein as how I got a busted front spring
theres nothing out here but rattlesnakes aint it the truth lets get going she said impatiently I
getting the boss rattlesnake to help you I meant what I said lord declared
what else would I mean she looked at him lips compressed
ill tell you about that lord told him we aim t be seelective
I just do what im told and that could mean trouble with a fella thats workin for crooks
ill get around to it a little later he mumbled desperately just as soon as I go to the bank and now mister mcbride said lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field bosss arm
he could no longer think of facesaving of honor but only of escape hes going to kill me he thought wildly
this was the way they would act laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death nothing would be done about it nothing unless donna donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him
other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up row by row in the buses his requesting and often getting higher wages better working conditions better schools changes that were slowly emerging even before the supreme court decision of then came this decision which sped the process of gaining equality or perhaps hindered it an abrupt change
it is clear that while most writers enjoy picturing the negro as a woollyheaded humble old agrarian who mutters and with blissful deference to his white employer or in old south terms massuh this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as caldwells lester while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through the rural south such men appear to be a vanishing breed
writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro type presenting an individualized negro character is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could tackle and the success of such an endeavor is as suggested above glaringly rare
as john t westbrook says in his article twilight of southern regionalism southwest review winter the miasmal mausoleum where an old south already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry should be left to rest in peace forever dead and forever done with westbrook further bemoans the southern writers creation of an unreal image of their homeland which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting yankees our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence of urbanization presented to his senses
willard thorp in his new book american writing in the twentieth century observes certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what herrick dreiser and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did for new york
I could use some help but I cannt afford to pay you anything I guess youd better go on in the morning
I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep she stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said then she murmured youre very kind mr morgan
youll have to go to town to see the doc shell be all right jones said quickly
we dont have any way to get there and we cannt expect you to quit work just to take us to town well see morgan said
his half of a refrigerator stood outside on the curving veranda between unit number three and unit number four it was still raining and mrs kirbys cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue and green and magenta
he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed distrust of women once burned forever shy from now on his was going to be a mans world the north woods duck blinds at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries
thought id bake it out in the sun she studied him briefly
all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a lonely old age if he lived that long he leafed through the light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests four separate adventures of the bobbsey twins and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoofandmouth disease in cattle hideously illustrated
he didnt want to encourage anything here but on the other hand he didnt want her swiping his salami not onions came the answer the following day take vivian take vivian
they would be black or white or horseblanket plaid chic and splashy like vivian herself pink was for baby girls and grownup girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy
why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator he mused aloud it was mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails whats that you say nothing just glad the rains stopped she scrutinized him youre peaked
the sun blazing hot as prophesied was far from kind to mrs kirbys varicolored properties when charlie came up from the beach for his fouroclock pill the whole establishment looked like a floodlit modern painting great blocks of dizzy color punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators
this weekend he would look around for some more subdued retreat with cape roses maybe at the door he could not imagine a flowers being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and the rest
it gave him a good feeling was her answer the next day
neither do I charlie grinned she didnt sound like a pale girl
all too frequently catholics run roughshod over protestant sensibilities in this matter by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and particularly by their jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades all too often our language is unduly harsh
the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement already existing between catholics and noncatholics concerning the overall objectives of family planning instead of catholics being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring as many noncatholics imagine the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed
there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement the grounds for the churchs position are scriptural the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law
the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive in determining the ethical character of birthprevention methods the roman catholic naturallaw tradition regards as selfevident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end
in the lambeth conference repeated its condemnation of contraception and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception together with the grave dangers thereby incurred and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the conference declared we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage
as to the necessity for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children and consequently of control of conception there can be no question there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right
since then many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared it at times to be a religious duty what determines the morality is not the means used but the motive
in general the means that prove most effective are considered the most ethical this development is reflected in the action taken in february by the general board of the national council of churches the largest protestant organization in the afj are you trying to wreck my career
thats what youre doing wrecking it wrecking it wrecking it griffith had confronted hoag on the buildings front steps and backed him against a wroughtiron railing
a couple of sobs escaped him followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state im not fit to touch the hem of her garment
at the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress what is it he asked
docherty said its okay bonfiglio let him by they walked toward each other
griffith said hoag told me to tell you not to let the prime minister be alone with mahzeer griffith looked halfcrocked to the captain it would be just like him why not this is no damned holiday beckworth get busy sir
watson turned away and did not see the mans knees buckle and his body sag sir he had acknowledged the man
there was a clock for him to crawl against if he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud
henry said that hed take my arm and get me right there you aint henry it raises the voice bein in camp you secesh course I can I can walk real good
the man wheezed weakly his fetid breath beating softly against watsons neck his sweet whisper came after great effort I wish you was henry he promised to take me
the men mewed and scratched begging to be taken away watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pineknot torches
he was angry sickened he had not felt that during the afternoon nor later
all his emotions had been inward selfconscious in war on a night like this it was only the outward emotions that mattered what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others
a texan wrote to a male companion at home what has become of halda and laura when you see them again give them my love not best respects but love by god
william r stillwell an admirable georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the georgia department of archives and history liked to tease his wife in his letters after he had been away from home about a year he wrote if I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married
it sowered my stomack and turn loose on me a michigan soldier wrote his brother I am well at present with the exception I have got the dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same

private george gray hunter of pennsylvania wrote I am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago another yankee became so disgusted as to state I wish to god one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against

shortly after the beginning of shermans georgia campaign an ailing yank wrote his homefolk the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than union quackery
private jenkins lloyd jones of the wisconsin light artillery wrote in his diary I strolled among the alabamans on the right found some of the greenest specimens of humanity in the universe their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect they recooned as how youuns all would be a heap wus to weuns all
you realize how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones it was in that abraham wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house on dogtown common a desolate place even then
red and handley knew the old dogtown lore and I knew they knew it for id told them a lot of it it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows
gentlemen I am getting to the point to my point you know the facts they are set forth in your own newspapers
so what I am trying to tell you is the why that is my point and that concerns the spirit of the matter there is an inwardness and a luster to old furniture which has a provocative emanation if I may say so
just think of old granther stannard who pulled the teeth of dark younger and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass after that he was never known to run or even walk fast
get that in your reports it accounts for so many things
id often find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching they were both painters
anyhow dogtown common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only sunday picnickers still stray up there from time to time searoad railroad lack of water killed dogtown dead dead as a brass door nail and I sometimes feel like the sexton for im about the last to be even interested
im quite sure its important because of the beech pasture whats that
thats what gave me the feeling gave me asitwere the spirit the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair you see besides being custodian of antiquities I am also registrar
I dont hold with those who live entirely among dead things I know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries where the live wind blows and not from the hull
hes always like that in spite of being a big man when you see him youll notice his habit of fingering a large mole with black hairs on it by his right temple
a real gentleman would do neither hes always worn a broadbrimmed hat and ive noticed in my small study at the society that he rather smells of cosmetics
after the usual honorable sirs it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased salu norberg one lower room on the western side privileges to the well and bakeoven and to one third of the cellar also one cow right and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower namely the beech pasture I remember that the whole of the privileges not counting the beech pasture was valued at twenty pounds
hed talked about doing so in fact he often disappeared from time to time off to paint the sea aboard a dragger out from gloucester
anyhow I wasnt surprised early that morning to see handley himself crossing from dogtown common road to the back road he didnt have his gun which he should have
sally youve got all evening to visit with dan his wounds need dressing now
golly dont that fiddle make you wish the bible didnt say us baptists cant dance nor methodists neither she replied not that it matters to me being this far along
with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her boneweary legs and worried about all that might have happened to sally she was deeply thankful that she could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle skipping and singing farmer in the dell farmer in the dell the dairyoh the farmer in the dell
rod and dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins gran they said almost in unison
ive seed more hair than that on a piece o bacon the two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with alice
the oldsmobile with the license number jyj was in stall number five ill let you know if I close the deal on the office in this building
he started to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and said youre the one I was talking to about a monthly rental
thats all right he said youre going to be a regular
if you expect her to show up youd better put and wife on there its a formality
the place wasnt particularly busy at that time of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was clothed in the tightestfitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was wanted to be sociable you really in a hurry handsome she asked
ill be here at tenfiftyfive I said you she announced
how much overweight is she not a bit but shes keeping her figure in hand
it got worse instead of better first it came out after mr coopers will was settled that john and his mother werent rich any more
you shouldnt underestimate edythe mousie said I know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained
dont think linda couldnt have got john back any time if shed tried mousie gordon who had been mousie chandler said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le mont you know she couldve but she isnt that kind of girl
now it would be a blessing I think poor john linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed bobbies death could move her to feeling
I believe poor johnll work just a little harder with that wife of his I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance
though not professional musicians they were a musicloving family in his native cologne where his mother taught him to play the piano he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet
by observing the conductor I learned how not to conduct the musician ran away from school when he was fifteen but this escapade did not save him from the gymnasium
this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post the maestro assented
he always wished to be a conductor originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such
other world premieres will be gardner reads third symphony and burle marxs samba concertante next year we will do a piano concerto by elliott carter with jacob lateiner as soloist
my pittsburghers have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour especially mahlers first and fourth symphonies and das lied von der erde and bruckners sixth and seventh
now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us I am probably the only one who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner and mahler since he introduces so much modern music I could not resist asking how he felt about it
as my wife puts it all you know is your music after all you never learned anything else
he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature his prime interest apart from music was his family his wife daughter and son
it is easy for you to talk you travel around the world we would like to do that too
what they wished for most was security what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country the ideal home would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms just enough for a family consisting of husband wife and two children
then and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent group from greenwich village to the embarcadero he had become a suckerrolling freightjumper
there aint nothin faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball freight when you na go someplace feathertop would say the accommodations may not be the poshest but there aint nobody askin for your ticket stub neither
he was riding the dark train out out and out and never to return again one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped
she pulled her legs up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and feathertops music pfffted away that is a very nice a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner a little thing but the right twist for the action that counted hot that was the word hot hair like a morningfrightened sparrows wings with the sun shining down over them a poet yet
his thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however then the boy straightarmed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting
he was less to see but feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight curly hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummers blocky hands and a body that said maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes but then im finished we made it cappy the chick said
seems so dont it the boy laughed hugging her close feathertop interrupted standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants none of that
stay with me kitty he snapped irritably I vowed to take care of you and thats what im gon na do
we dont know this guy square bit feathertop screwed his face up
we we eloped cappy said his head came up and he said it defiantly
im just a poor exjazz man name of boyd smith he grinned at them wolfishly
feathertop aimed a finger at him come on cappy the girl chided
slug the kid grab his dough and then have a rockin ball with the doll whered you come from mr mr smith kitty inquired politely
the boy scowled at him and the girl looked shocked certainly not that isnt what I said she snapped at him
we got dinner right here cmon buddy help me set up the kitchen and well have food in a minute or two
a charcoal pit he said indicating the slightlysmoking makeshift brazier fan it he told cappy handing him a sheet of newspaper but whatre we gon na eat charcoal
fella you try my everlovin patience he reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners hot dogs not the greatest but they stick to your belly insides
I selfserved when they had licked the last of the wieners taste from their fingers they settled back and cappy offered ernie a cigarette nice kid too bad
cappys head came around sharply your fault it was all my fault cappy raged at himself he was stupid her old man
you never heard nothin like it kittys gon na go have an abortion and kittys gon na go away to a convent and kittys this and kittys that like he was nuts or somethin ernie nodded
that had been a time before all this a time he didnt think about a time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out these kids werent like him what they got you get forget all this other
a drink ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket now that you offer the answer came from the open door of the boxcar from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade
he belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door he said and reached into his pocket
I dont think so said the big man and it was the final clincher for ernie he had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it
ernie was screaming inside himself damn you you aint gon na take my meal ticket away from me the newcomer stalked toward them and kitty shied back her hand to her mouth
the kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back the fist went down into the pile of flesh and ernie heard the bigger mans deeper voice go
early in january he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans and upon learning of gorhams intention henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless negroes
I considered that your views would be best carried out by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of emancipation I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience & justice

nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty the present issue in atlantica resembles the american one of rather than the one that was resolved by civil war
this right of the state was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the union government the champions of the union maintained that the constitution had formed fundamentally the united people of america that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states and that therefore the states had no right to secede though the citizens could

he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised then somebody else dont question dont invite danger
added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she wouldnt have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by its taste it was merely an attempt to frighten her

his chief discovery was important the great north river but it produced no northwest passage when the half moon put in at dartmouth england in the fall of word of hudsons findings leaked out and english interest in him revived

early in june the discovery passed desolation and in midjune entered the furious overfall floating ice bore down from the north and west
a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther instead of quelling the dissension as many captains of the era would have done hudson decided to be reasonable

most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue illusion just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences in this manner they sidestep the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually

I looked closely at his eyes and he was already innocent the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his you can not I said pushing aside the water jar he offered to me

now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object of his pride when rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip I didnt think twice about it
ive helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brothers tackle shop I gave him the first decent job he ever had six seven how many years ago was it rob
he was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the german who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley schaffner he had said
I make you one thank you very much schaffner had answered in his accented english I like that kid I agree
if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country is that right herr schaffner said
thats what he told me thats his main reason for making the dive

there was no definite agreement about business arrangements waddell said
I know this from my talks with him lets let him make up his own mind waddell said on the basis of the facts
all tourists come to florida this will help him to get out of his little tackle shop there is no use causing him to worry at this time the germans words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty

let me set the record this time and let me get back ok so the german will give me the exclusive make my life different and better from this time on

he looked at his son his face worried scotty murmured so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him
his hands lay loosely yet stiffly folded in his lap his mouth hung slightly open when he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable he would answer if as often happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or impatience only a little louder
they turned at the bottom of kates steps and moved off in the direction of the park he thought he saw that elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash

theres time in any case well wait till youre stronger and then talk about it

it is characteristic of him to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art this occurs now at the refrain of jacobys song at the point in fact of the name lizzy a modulation described as almost a stroke of genius
by the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience he collapses and dies in the work of every artist there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive ultimately emblematic of what it is all about not less strikingly so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image a single moment so here
finally the theatrical and perversely erotic notions of dressing up cosmetics disguise and especially change of costume are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of manns stories we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates
for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together in prophetic parody professionally a lawyer that is to say associated with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially middleclass he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up disguised paradoxically revealed as a child and worse as a whore masquerading as a child
that this abandonment takes place on a stage during an artistic performance is enough to associate jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the punishment for art he is suspect guilty punishable as is anyone in manns stories who produces illusion and this is true even though the constant elements of the artistnature technique magic guilt and suffering are divided in this story between jacoby and lautner it appears that the dominant tendency of manns early tales however pictorial or even picturesque the surface is already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic
the first sentence with its platitudinous irony announces an emblematic intent the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad ran beside it all the way to the end to the churchyard the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction
the highroad belongs to life while the way to the churchyard belongs to death that is too simple and wont hold up
his rage assumes a religious form on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecates doom on life not only the cyclist now but the audience the world as well all you lightheaded breed this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal
it was dark and very large only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness
I felt certain he was really a spineless little man his hat hung on a hook on the wall and underneath it I could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck
in the mornings fluorescent tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall they and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office
he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words I was shown instead a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out every morning
here was something of obvious importance to me yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand he couldnt afford to have anyone mess around with them he said
it was possible that they were men who having received no tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below
also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder no sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me in order to bring back my attention
when I asked him what I could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall I could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before ten oclock
he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there indeed my scholastic qualifications were such that he a college graduate himself must envy me them I sure that I knew what I was applying for
though I doubted that he would understand me I told the director my motives for applying I had always hankered after working hard with my hands
this desire had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing to this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence
when he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh miss langford was an attractive girl
tall blonde blueeyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh starched summer dress something was beginning to stir and come alive in her too you could tell it by the way she watched the older bigger boys like jack
the first two or three days they went home early all except jack he hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened desks and put the room in order
once she kneeled down to pick up some books where theyd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating
about that time miss langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him although probably she didnt even see him he jumped back ducked and ran crouching down the hill away from the school
that night he dreamed a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the teacher did everything except engage in the act and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire he ate litle that morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate heartily
im not hungry he said pushing back the bacon and eggs outside it was already hot at am and it was getting hot in the kitchen
I wont play hard he promised just then charles lever yelled jack from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door yelling mom over his shoulder
jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were charles only apparent interest but jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from charles revelations so he usually invited them as he did now what
his heart beat faster you say he said lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles howd you do it I jist got on top of
I mean howd you get her to do it I jist ask her jist like that
come on miss langford play with us just onct one of the little girls begged smiling wistfully not now said the teacher maybe at dinner time
when she appeared two or three of the little girls jumped up and down yelling lets play withem jack said rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants
then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over her head while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again jack ran over offered her his hand and said im sorry miss langford
the girl said I dont believe ill play any more neither
that should do it because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he couldnt take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand facetowall in a corner instead of stay in after school
to his surprise his plan worked perfectly if you cant do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out miss langford said firmly not smiling

you just leave me alone lieutenant killpath peered through halfclosed lids at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and aboutfaced
finally orville intoned through his hawk nose we cant have people running in any time they please sergeant sir running in running out
killpath said you were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago sergeant thats not getting all the juice out of the orange is it sir
you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time sergeant vaughn sir youre just guessing sergeant
thats not regulation is it sir but you didnt know a thing about it did you I was out in the district sir so I have heard
he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk I might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped
he stared at the report in killpaths hand sure it was written by accacia just as sure as if hed submitted it in his scrawled longhand he sucked in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet again wound the goldwire stems of his glasses around his ears and then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned acting lieutenant gunnar matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the stations activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the homicide detail of the inspectors bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander acting captain ot killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as afterhours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six failed to cooperate with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordere
what have you to say to that sergeant killpath sailed the paper across the desk but matson didnt pick it up or even glance at it
patrolman accacia is an alert and conscientious lawenforcement officer I dont think his diligence mitigates your negligence matson negligence
he interrupted himself looking around gun at the doorway lieutenant rinker orville I thought you hadnt come in yet
a time plan is a mere convenience and when he interrupted himself smiling
