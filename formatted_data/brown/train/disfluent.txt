on the other we have the flagwavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material willynilly unfortunately few of the artists writers movie producers dramatists and musicians who have used american folklore since have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways
stephen vincent benets john browns body comes immediately to mind in this connection as does john steinbecks the grapes of wrath and carl sandburgs the people yes the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass should be used frequently but shaken before using

these two basic malformations have of course many variations a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw crooked overlapping twisted or widely spaced teeth front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close the eyeteeth third from the middle on top counting each front tooth as the first beginning to protrude like fangs second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out making a double row
for these and other reasons says dr brodie orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system
plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used and they save time and money plaster of paris once utilized in making impressions of teeth has been replaced by alginates gelatinlike material that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child
prevention is best as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be after your childs baby teeth are all in usually at the age of two and one half to three its time for that first dental appointment dr brodie advises

men she reflected even men like stanley are unpredictable she tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they werent so many after all
it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in taking such a momentous step stanley went along in life she knew convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman
as a result he never looked for it one day she expected he would somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such a woman in the world a woman who was willing to give him love faith and anything else a woman could give a husband
even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general peltz the commander who would conduct the little blitz on london in a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously true there had been raids on naples but naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast

as a matter of fact fogg and his plane didnt get beyond pennsylvania in the race an engine oil leak forced him down but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wryfaced backers with all this experience bob fogg was a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract
each time in the unhappy pilot pushing his luck begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place preferably on the flattopped hills across the winooski river fogg they countered we cant get over there
a sheeplined leather flying suit plus helmet goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit the airmans stock answer to werent you cold became yes the first half hour is tough but by then im so numb I dont notice it

painting isnt this big you know it doesnt embrace only the artist alone before his easel
the artist is like a fragment of a mosaic no he is more than that a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic one of these days im going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything thats being painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism and then youll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other

they advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up with gingerly steps towards the first landing it was then that they heard the tread of one descending and in some perturbation glancing up saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing
the doctor he noticed was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stairwell eyes swerved in the patronnes head alex coughed loudly and the doctor with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him took to the stairs in longshanked leaps
chickens have short memories the doctor remarked thats why they are better company than most people I know and he went on to break some important news to alex well he began it seems like some people in paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do

we talked after I hailed his jeep marked with the un flag practically all the people of laos he explained about two million of them are rice farmers and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows
to many a frenchman they came years ago colonized and stayed until laos became independent in the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe
even if it did not how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns to find out we traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled in the daytime at least by the royal lao army from attopeu the city of buffalo dung in the southeast to muong sing the city of lions in the northwest close to communist china map page

the king arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didnt want heaven knew didnt want to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations to distant homes probably through rain or in november something worse the king arthur was less expensive than the dumont

hunch now willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four if for no other reason willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything else that went on two legs

perhaps if felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered womans apartment we might have had less trouble convincing felix of our seriousness this you will remember was still new years day

time marches on well to get back to the problem of retirement every retiring person has a different situation facing him
some have serenity of mind the ability to accept what they have and make the most of it a wonderful gift to have believe me some see only darkness the bitter side of everything well whatever you have thats it

after they had finished eating melissa took sprite the kitten under her arm so that auntie grace can teach it about the whistle and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother she had offered to walk but pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called auntie
that mistake she thought had cost her dearly these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her she must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest
on her bureau lay a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving an object which pamela believed now had been the property of her greatgrandfather major hiram munroe culver he had belonged to this land and perhaps had desecrated it and this was the only material symbol that remained of him
it was not thought pamela such an evil place after all no wonder melissa responded so completely to its beckoning perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed I read it yes this ought to simplify tolleys life ill be fair now he is coming back isnt he frank yes oh yes
this last time he drank not to brace but to tolley mr robards jenny was the only person she knew of in the mt pleasant neighborhood who called him that was kind but too easygoing
it didnt bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say howdy miss jenny adding a careless roy but it did her he could put a stop to it she told him again and again
another weakness far more irritating than his manner of speaking which he made only token effort to change was his devotion to that old horse of tolleys her horse rather but mr robards now oh my yes indeed yes he called her the mare much as mrs whipsnade spoke of the queen god bless her

immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another favor he have pen and paper please
you must make an opera out of this material they wouldnt leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised oh the irony and the bitterness of it
what else could he do you couldnt on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time practice them could you well yes perhaps in literature since you could argue that you couldnt keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself but now music too no
these little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep but no he couldnt appear as a composer now
the ladies especially couldnt understand what troubled him a contradiction bah what was a contradiction in ones life
im dressed as I always am rousseau said neither better nor worse at home yes they argued
the persistent horror of having a malformed child has I believe been reduced not because we have gained any control over this misfortune but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it in fact the recent warnings about the use of xrays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance science has momentarily aggravated our fears
it didnt take us as long as wed thought it might it pseudoattach was not quite six oclock when we finished and charlie said well I guess thats it shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first

the finished and drastically cut product would begin with a hazy longshot of joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pools surface clad in layers of lavender lather and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap even to clean men and boys joyce went on when wed finished lou mr thor asked me to stay a little longer yes he didnt did I mean

martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story the tale he thought would become less gay

selena masters joe realized was her own woman she was the only kind of negro laura andrus would want around independent unservile probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework and doubly efficient
the woman had the glassy look of an invalid as if she had not slept at all oh we managed she said

the skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy he imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined if they were they were never penalized whose children had no unhappy romances whose names never knew scandal

this dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians which prior to says pasley had been maintained with more or less stealth but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings denounced by a clergyman as belshazzar feasts at which politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters openly in the big downtown hotels pasley continued they became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in
to settle this slight obanion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop where he had learned dave miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy at the end of the performance dave and max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters

as you have doubtless guessed already the plot is plastered with freudian jungian and meinckian theory for example when the film is only four minutes old neitzbohr refers to a small victorian piano stool as wilhelmina and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name of course was doris the english equivalent when passed through middlegaelic derivations of wilhelmina
as we find out at the end it is not the stool symbolizing doris therefore the english that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind when the slat finally shatters we see him count the fragments all the while muttering he loves me he loves me not
not only was haumds intonation and phrasing without flaw but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride for example to move as the score requires from the lowest fmajor register up to a barely audible n minor in four seconds not skipping at the same time even one of the fingerings seems a feat too absurd to consider and it is to the flautists credit that he remained silent throughout the passage
for the last two years this frontier of the arts has produced a number of socalled nondramas which have left indelible bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer the latest and significantly greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the an adaptation of bashos classic froghaiku by roger entwhistle a former university of maryland chemistry instructor
although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness there are eleven acts varying in length from twentyfive seconds to an hour and a half the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention the action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee
leaving the theatre after the performance I had a flash of intuition that life after all as rilke said is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude the story of a nymphomaniac triphammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middleaged steam shovel

I paint the nothing he said once to franz kline and myself the nothing that is behind the something the inexpressible unpaintable tick in the unconscious the spirit of the moment resting forever suspended like a huge balloon in nontime it is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as the invasion of cuba he wondered does one enjoy ones spare time

she apparently wasnt satisfied with his reaction smug owen thought smug and sappy there was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye
they are a very difficult group of people I dont know much about them owen admitted but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do

doctor lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes then by squeezing her foot three times he came up presto with a different diagnosis with each squeeze
she had he informed her kidney trouble liver trouble and a severe female disorder he explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it he knew just the thing for her a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator machine
as he applied the applicator extending from the machine which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base to the supposedly diseased portions of mrs shaefers body lee kept up a steady stream of pseudoscientific mumbojumbo yes the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything he assured her
she know he asked why the colors of the tubes were important to peoples health the human body he pointed out for example required units of blue light
for that reason he informed her the lord made the sky blue continuing glibly in this vein he paused to comfort her dont you worry
as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about why I once used this machine to cure a woman with pounds of cancer in her body
his plunder is therefore far higher running into hundreds of millions according to the food and drug administration fda doctor ghadiali dr albert abrams and his clique and dr wilhelm reich to name three notorious device quacks succeeded respectively in distributing and fake health machines
you will come up with a frightening total thats why the fda the american medical association ama and the national better business bureau bbb have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ million u or so paid to medical charlatans annually
the postmaster general recently reported that mail order frauds among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently are at the highest level in history similarly the american cancer society acs the arthritis and rheumatism foundation and the bbb have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high

unfortunately says chief postal inspector david h stephens who has prosecuted many device quacks the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often can not be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court death have no doubt about it
general hersheys draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first eminence but fearless freddy bryan could take credit if he cared to and he did for the second time freddy needed a job having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by gerry and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one
well he said there is freddy you know and gerry freddy is deeply committed to our plans already
yes I appreciate that I wish you wouldnt tell freddy im lukewarm ive caused him trouble before and hes beginning to resent me
you were right he said you and your engineer and im in something of a bind freddys solution doesnt appeal to me
he was surprised and dubious but impressed by the engineer and the report your alternative is breathtaking he said and im frank in saying a bit mad
I wish I was younger and less timid well I cant resolve this myself
I cant guarantee you a sympathetic audience well be in there swinging william said but in a way sir youve got to decide it yourself
youre youre arthur willis forgive the hearts and flowers theme
oh my god ham richert said a little child shall lead them move over general motors
hear me out please william begged im an advertising hustler I admit but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere
sure ticonderoga went broke in the lowpriced market bucking the big three their cars werent small enough they didnt have the power they were oldfashioned
theres plenty of risk money ham richert added but not for anything this risky all right william said
spikehaired burly redfaced decked with hornrimmed glasses and an ivy league suit jack hamrick awaited william at the officers club hello boss he said and grinned
you mean a game with cards no said the halfman a sort of eyemachine with real people doing the figures I never saw that said mercer but I
we all know what the dummies will do he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled and we all know what the new people will ask we never know how long a scene is going to take
the halfman laughed with something close to real humor no no no youve got the lovelies on the brain
he made a sound of despair deep in his throat it was embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen aaaee
our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of eromonga I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft I expected brassnose as a man with a strain of melanesian in his blood to speak to them
in the hut to which I was assigned max had his own quarters my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases her name was lturu and she told me many things
for an anthropologist loquacious old lturu was a mine of information though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women her account was later confirmed by the scobeefrazier expedition from the university of manitoba in
from lturu I heard that until about the people of this island which was about the size of guam or smaller had been of both sexes and that the normal family life of melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations in the middle of the last century an island woman named karipo seized a spear in the heat of an intertribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled
she cackled with mirth showing the stumps of betelstained teeth karipos women then named this place eromonga manhood for just the strongest men could stay here
dont forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling reminded him well with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldnt be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation yeah
and a pane of glass isnt hard to the telephone interrupted him he scooped up the receiver and said police chief into the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson
I was hoping id hear from you today with his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying uhhuh and I see at intervals
at last he said well thank you for calling mr benson although there was no doubt in my mind and weve been handling it as one im glad to have it made official he paused thats about it oh the time of death
the duration of the digestive process varies the pathologist says but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that mrs meeker died several hours after her sevenoclock dinner probably around midnight give or take an hour either way pauling paused again
however likely it was pauling said he couldnt limit himself to it he had to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to johnston came to light
garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement
she in the habit of making new wills oh no she had reason to change the one she made right after mr meekers death
a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflected tenure too very nice for him he went on to personal bequests a list of names largely unknown to him twentyfive thousand to each of the greatnieces in oregon not much to blood relatives out of millions ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars to the pecks ten thousand each to joan sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in mrs meekers employ at the time of the latters death
well she had a number of them where money was concerned garth said sometimes wed have trouble persuading her to make taxexempt charitable contributions and ive known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet the next moment shed put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston affair
his expenses ran another four or five thousand the lawyer didnt know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party thayer like himself madden reflected was the extra man so prized by hostesses and found him easy enough to talk to
the whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug no doubt mrs meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing
even so maddens dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened it would be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the fraud with its probable byproduct of murder led to garths door motive tenthousanddollar bequest
airy and bright the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture rugs and draperies done by a professional decorator madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable as its occupant
however by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters and better yet whether he has a taste for wine again by spreading ones purchases over several wine dealers one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad
now the drinking of wine and happily so is for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the supply would dry up in no time at all this is the only valid and extenuating argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter
a really good wine waiter is paradoxically the guardian and not the purveyor of his cellar against the visigoths faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence
too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine provided the eye has not already spotted it is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it if it smells of wine the bottle is probably all right if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion
a white wine already at cool cellar temperature may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator the former is far preferable in about fifteen minutes for those who live in a winter climate there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow though by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time
it may be a bit cold when poured but again as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should be served in a large tulipshaped glass which is never filled more than half full in this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal or the course in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages
by tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature if anything a little cooler and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well thus red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself
he cleared his throat and wet his lips as cheerfully as possible he said well I guess we could all do with a little drink
hettie he said as gently as he could were still headed west somewhere well hit a trail
I suppose he muttered I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement dont try to be noble
her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for ben out of compulsion to say something cheery ben prime blurted well we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit
herold he saw had fled well one did not expect much of people like herold
an open field was better than a building that was for sure so he dismounted turned off the horse and plunged through the grass he felt curiously sleepy the world seemed far away he knew he should get to cap but he didnt know how
as sir giles overreach how often had he had to play that part who did not believe a word of it he raised his arm and declaimed where is my honour now that was one of the high spots of the play
meanwhile it looked at the scenery well I guess I know enough to turn you inside out you sockdologizing old mantrap
it was not exactly panic they gave way to but they could not just sit there the beehive voices for no one could bear silence drowned out the sound of mrs lincolns weeping
an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead in her minds eye her imagination responding fully almost exhaustingly to these shores peculiar powers of stimulation she saw the city as from above telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress there a pine and all around the low blue hills
moreover nursing various stubblefields her aunt then her mother then her father through their lengthy illnesses everybody could tell you the stubblefields were always sick theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot england france germany switzerland and italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes
she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george alas george when he had written had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin elecs funeral
his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for his grandchildren he had one so far still in diapers he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand poor george the only boy the family darling together with her mother both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong
theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george it just be theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull
he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped in his bathrobe on a footstool he held his long clenched foot in both hands and this and his contorted face he was trying heroically not to cry out made him look like a large skinny old monkey
of course georges letter continued there are practical problems to be considered cousin emma is alone in that big old house and wont hear to parting from it
I really shouldnt have smoked a cigarette so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick ill start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps no said theresa no no she said
the trouble is theresa thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow
oh put it there she indicated a spot a little distance away
in a growing number of american homes marriage counselors report the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships it is she who decides the time the place the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act
of course there remain many oldfashioned marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy yet even in these marriages psychologists say wives are asserting themselves more strongly
when the roles of husband and wife are reversed so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower dr linden says the effects on their whole relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous in one extreme case cited by a pittsburgh psychologist an office workers wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded
the wifes attempt at control these psychologists contend is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative
the pattern says dr morton schillinger psychologist at new yorks lincoln institute for psychotherapy is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night no one seriously contends of course that the domineering wife is sexually speaking a new character in our world
furthermore dr calderone says a certain number of docile retiring men always have been around they arent frigid and they arent homosexual theyre just restrained in all of life
grandma wasnt expected to like it dr marion hilliard the late toronto gynecologist once summed up the attitude of thes wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as used by their husbands and history indicates they often quite literally were
very few wives says dr calderone who balance the checkbook fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well
according to dr ellis the average yearold american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner not surprisingly dr ellis says some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities
when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wifes aggressiveness dr linden says the wife in turn finds him inadequate often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction
one such wife dr linden says became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man or his wife because he or she feels age creeping up on the other hand a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive asking psychologists say for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable
a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted flattered or coaxed simply because she needs her ego lifted in any case dr calderone remarks such problems are a couples own affair and cant always be measured by a general yardstick
to get a marriage back where it belongs comments dr schillinger of the lincoln institute the husband must take some very basic steps he must begin paradoxically by becoming more selfish
he must become more expressive of his own desires more demanding and less understanding too many husbands dr schillinger continues worry about how well theyre doing and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play
he didnt stop till he was within three feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leaders right hand was on the butt of his revolver im billy tilghman said the stranger and ive come for pat conyers body

the hymen is in essence a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations hymen in fact is the greek word for membrane often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin during the same examination two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall the bottom of the vagina in the same position without any pain and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times
many years later on august lucy upton wrote winslows daughter soon to be graduated from smith college while I love botany which after dabbling in for years I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being that was my favorite study
she read maitlands dark ages which I enjoyed very much la croix on the customs of the middle ages chapters of bryce and liked it more and more more chapters of guizot lecky and stanleys eastern church she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone
their house writes albert s flint was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer especially grateful to one like myself far from home lucy was a lively part of the household
she had taught classes in botany astronomy with the aid of a telescope geometry and psychology miss upton and miss packard as a matter of fact had many tastes in common yet they thrived on it at the fifteenth anniversary as already quoted miss upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future as a college of first rank with expanding and unlimited horizons
when dr wallace buttrick wise in his judgment of people declined to have the science building named for him he wrote miss tapley april if you had asked me I think I would have suggested that you name the building for miss upton her services to the school for many years were of a very high character and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her
the daughters of spelman she said had never known or thought of spelman without her the removal of miss packard years earlier had caused them great sorrow but they still had miss giles
the books of the school hold a memorial to her and so do the hearts of students and of teachers mary j packard states a messenger editorial was efficient painstaking selfeffacing loving radiating the spirit of her master
martha schuyler old slow careful of foot came down the great staircase dressed in her best lacedrawn black silk her jeweled shoe buckles held forward well im here at last she said addressing the old portraits on the walls

it is harder he muttered to meditate on man or woman than on god david finished shaving washed his face clean of lather and combed and retied his hair
all this too shall pass away it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy yes in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal hudson valley where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those englishdutch manors with their wellfed squires
there was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received it was always the same unqualified success now he could no longer build anything whether a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other values
sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved it all seemed if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows as though this brokennosed man with the muscular arms and wrestlers neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the bosss work
he did not notice and was already backing the car down to the road saying toottoot to the stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed she stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road
he looked at her out of himself she thought as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotinechoked lungs the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the tate gallery on a thursday once now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said toot once more and roared off into the fog his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator just as his hand did when he worked
every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things stowey yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and nothing was burning on the stove and lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes
how could it have been thirty years already she wondered yes nineteen plus thirty was fortynine and she was fortynine and she had been married at nineteen
the roads washed badly said dill but theres a trail you can get over with a horse a company of cavalry couldnt come in there if two men were guarding that trail hes quite a rat you know he sold out to krugers men

what was that old sign supposed to be painted over a door somewhere abandon hope all ye who enter here why holden said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight ill bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be
theyve worried theyve lain awake nights theyve shook at the slightest footstep theyve pictured their own destruction and now its all over and they can give up sure theyre giving up hope
hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension goodbye holden waved a hand at the empty street glad to see you go
and then you wiped up some grease she had caught him off guard no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster no green paint wasnt it well im not sure of the color
holden noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck my goodness you ought to remember if I do
when he was answered he said albert vince im sending you a couple of customers yeah just get them out of my hair and keep them out I dont give a damn what you tell them only dont believe a word they say theyre out to make trouble for me and it is up to you to stop them I dont care how and one more thing cates cafe closed at eleven like always last night and rose and clarence corsi left for quebec yesterday some shrine or other I think it was called saint simons yeah yesterday grosse swore now dammit all vince I aint no baby sitter
she could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car she had figured that out but she couldnt understand their subsequent actions it because she had shown panic
although she found she was thirsty she was about to refuse never never take candy from a strange man when she saw the bottle was unopened he placed a bottle opener on the counter lauren said please he was back at work on a car roberta said no you go
it was as if foreign duty implied and excused license it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it and therefore why not then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different harro girlsan
at least he had the decency to blush she thought oh im sorry
you see I thought I mean I really had no idea oh yes you had ideas tommy interrupted furiously all wrong ones
uh sorry he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy
well doc you old sonofabitch whitey exclaimed with true affection come over and have a drink
nick wondered if elaine had bought them but he said nothing nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything
someday geologists had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach meanwhile fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers
sometimes the fish exploded as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip
the fin on his foot caught on the moulding throwing him off balance his forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat keereist

most of their original objections about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous to them bodies were mercifully concealed helvas class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program
why what a lovely voice you have said one of the female visitors helva looked up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface
yes we have quite a few years of voice training madam remarked helva calmly vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intrastellar distances and must be eliminated
I am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw no I say the lady twittered
the ladys eyes unmagnified bugged out oh I forget and helvas voice was really contrite
in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw well remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread
you referring sir asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin I had that in mind
her first actual flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner

as for rebuilding well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no hurry at all wilson again went downtown to a different banker an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but he shook his head
reverend he said I think you dont quite understand the situation here you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church tenements stores saloons some gambling I hope not too much
now if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years by that time perhaps something better can be done no said wilson I dont I was just asking about it
the part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate it could have been like that for only a little while but true memory does not count nor add it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time once then for how many years or how few does not matter my world was bound round by fences when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough to twist my knee over it and pull myself up
my greatgrandmother I have been told made her garden her great pride she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wallflowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house these my grandmother left in their places they are still there more persistent and longerlived than the generations of man and planted others like them that flourished without careful tending
in one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eightyone refugees the method of destroying the evidence embarrassed paul bangjensen
he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence he was right and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordiers words on the subject well it seemed as good a place as any to do the job
the result was the gross report prepared by gross as chairman with the assistance of two un under secretaries constantin stavropoulos and philippe de seynes yes gross went on bangjensen was an upandcoming young man
you know the lawyer said its difficult to talk like this about a man who cant answer back gross was behind a cleantop desk only a manila folder before him
gross swung his swivel chair well how could that have been
well as a matter of fact ive looked through backissue files of new york papers for december and havent found a great deal gross shot another look at marshall it wasnt necessarily all here in new york
why mick shann went over and over the report with alsing andersen trying to check them out even after the incident between bangjensen and shann in the delegates lounge and this was not the way the chicago tribune presented it gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings
after all this shann went over all that bangjensen had brought up shanns own report peter marshall reflected describes the encounter as immoderate
it sounded like a fair enough invitation peter marshall reflected and bangjensen must have thought so too because on the thirteenth he met the group of three on the thirtysixth floor of the un there ernest gross further assured him we were requested by the secretary general as I understand it to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat

when you marry you want to have things in common a girl said and its hard when you dont marry someone with your own background a fourteenyearold girl from the middle west observed wryly that in her community religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious
at the same time there is a good deal of selfcongratulation at attending a good college they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues and they express pleasure at the cozy ingroup feeling that the college generates its people of your own kind a girl remarked
almost everybody in the senior class is married students say dogmatically the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities sororities and houses in the house plan association that have good news to impart
how dared they demand to snoop in private financial records disbursements confidential contracts and agreements it is as though I said on the historic threehour coasttocoast radio broadcast which I bought following father coughlin and preempting the eddie cantor manhattan merrygoround and major bowes shows that man in the white house like some despot of yore insisted on reading my diary raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie the litigation was costly and seemingly endless I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the supreme court mr roosevelt and his henchmen had done their dirty work all too well even going so far as to attempt to pack the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me
again my name was on all the front pages I was it seemed persona non grata in every quarter but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence
my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as reactionary robber baroness and even traitor traitor indeed I point now with pride to the fact that long ere the committee on unamerican activities the minute women the economic council and other such notable watchdog organizations were so much as heard of I was hollywoods leading bulwark against communism fighting singlehandedly creeping socialism against such insuperable odds as the fasciocommunist troops of the nra pwa wpa ccc and an army of more than twentytwo million mercenaries whom fdr employed secretly through the transparent ruse of regular relief checks
I tried my hardest with little help may I say from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside pressures were too severe having through my unflagging effort and devotion achieved stardom a fortune and a worldrenowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote letch proceeded to neglect them all
never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw but that is another story as for his private monies they were rapidly dissipated in drinking gaming and carousing
ah youre too old was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested starting a family letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter
I now felt it wiser to keep babydear in school and during the summers at a camp run by the society of friends all year around her presence only made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau belletch I had neglected to consider a room for babydear so there was no place to put her anyhow
it was small consolation in a rare fit of anger and spite I farmed out my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment an actor must have discipline
it was a potboiler made on a shoestring and not the sort of film I like as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal my heart was not in it but oddly enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my career I watched it on television late one night last week and it stands up remarkably well even twenty years later
there were times it wasnt right to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we dont keep peanut butter for a peanut butter sandwich you in this house he always told her why winston shed cry I just now saw you eating it out of the jar
her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool here winston said gently whats these dishes doing not washed
this is moving day winston reminded her and I bet you left things every which way upstairs your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made leona his eye had fastened on her leg bending he touched her knee if I catch you one more time down here without stockings she twitched her leg away
winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron here carefully he undid the bow I dont want to leave here winston now listen to that
she was too young that was all too young and thin and straight winston it was mr jack bellowing out in the hall
goodby winston mr jack said giving a final set to his hat look out for those movers
winston she said get the basket for the breakables winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall
frowning miss ada studied the list well lets see the china lemon tree the alabaster cockatoo
hes used it every day every morning I lay out his clothes on it well thats over now
winston laid it in the basket mr jack sets store by that really winston
ill give you a medical certificate framed if you like miss ada had said no all I want is a picture with a few lines
into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta as every artist delights to do wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair into the relations of men and women in their relations she was the giver and he the receiver nay the demander his feeling always exacted sacrifices from her
one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as highspirited and opinionated as herself she could not resist the opportunity of showing her superiority in argument over a man which she had remarked as one of the feminine follies of sara sullam and in her forthright way henrietta who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness to think of men as the privileged and women as submissive and yielding felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception he objected to her stand on the corbin affair as well as on the radical reforms of dr wise of hebrew union college until once in sheer desperation he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything
she wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments like oh what fun a comedy in three acts in which under personages henrietta appeared as a schoolmarm and bertha who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta had been appeared as dummkopf sadie studied piano played chopin in the soiree musicale of mr guthries pupils and she recited hectors farewell to andromache most movingly to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown near philadelphia where the szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds in baltimore
adele like amy the youngest of the marches was the rebellious mischievous rather calculating and ambitious one for rachel conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grapearbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones there was no particular march counterpart but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content the one being definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian
on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story it was of course a little boys fantasy of winning his mother to himself and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted a classical oedipal fantasy if you like but if it were only this the story would be banal
the rocking is actually felt in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy the rocking I realized is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a childs fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present it conceals and yet is suggestive a perfect symbol
he opened the myth book again and there along the margin next to robert graves imaginative interpretation of the creation of the dactyls from rheas fingertips were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilders address the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer
would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had found his first night in one of walters marked bars nicolas look nicolas doesnt go to bed with boys no sex see if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money ballet dancer protests tears and take what you want nicolas I am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful

she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens dear girl walter had finally said he writes me that he is sleeping in the english gardens
how like him mary jane had smilingly said his address walter added is that great foundling home the american express
his presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live simply with the angels she set down her suitcase
she wake him no smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched
a young american has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once and then we shall see the grafin was partial to the word shall
in the small gallery used as the guests dining room meredith sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young waitress he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets she also served as maid when he saw the grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table
it would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin so startled was he by mary janes beauty yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the grafin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special
mary jane had made very little effort above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no brassiere beneath
as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank you for the use of your bath when she sat down opposite him spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control meredith began falling in love soup only this morning veal cutlets oh I couldnt possibly eat all this wine then you were typing poems this afternoon fruit compote if you think I would understand it a smile what a beautiful room like as if it were built of books
I think the maids tipple in the afternoon those sweet girls oh youre joking
the husband points the steps out with his flashlight its white stare filling her pale eyes to the blind brim with appetite bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak all night mary jane asked herself if meredith was blushing at this line or was it the fire he read on
mary jane took the page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words oh its that myth about orpheus and what is her name
she began to explain there was this poet in italy he interrupted please dont judge all poets
what I mean is he was a pole and the greatest soldier in the ulanys hell sir the men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name
since the war I have seen the way the germans have behaved and I think holy mother we have behaved like this for hundreds of years why how can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see

there was something troubling him though as yet they hadnt five days keerist prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him
four cuts at least he chuckled to himself and I owe it all to them the word also made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled
one day ching had told him smiling patting him on the back as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders keep it up your squad is good one of the best keep it up keep up the good work he would
theyll get them by god and let them bring them down here to me just let them god ill slice their balls right off his arm moved swiftly violently once twice

when I think of people like you well I you what mary jane you are young intelligent have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself but you mess it up with whiskey indifference selfdestructive attitudes
oh yes I said feeling annoyed she was very pretty you dont believe that im going back to medical school and finish do you

it suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane brennan should know the truth about me that I was not the confused sick irresponsible person she believed me to be there are things about me that I cannt tell you now mary jane I said but if youll go out to dinner with me when I get out of hanover id like to tell you the whole story

in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors a point like f in figure would other things being equal be the dwelling place for the community leader while e and h would house the next most important citizens a point like p gets information directly from n but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n
even the officer in charge be it a captain for small display or a general is restrained by monitoring this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility
shes got more guts than any other woman in the world keith said penny keith you were wonderful

you actually hate me and we both know it because I killed that filthy snake well why dont you say something
he knew how to shoot down nazis he knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it because he was chemically incapable of fear
they grounded him over his protests not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the command offices that was where he met penny
he was aware of her as a frightfully goodlooking american wac a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the command offices but that was all penny knew him better on her part
he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so frequently he does not receive a fee at all but because he enjoys his work because he firmly believes that murder must be punished thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman
the rise of the giant corporations in western europe and the united states dates from the period now although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as balzac dickens and poe it was not until the closing decades of the th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction
it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial said ben gurion and not the nazi regime alone but antisemitism throughout history how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews without being an antisemite contribute to a verdict against antisemitism
shout at eichmann though he might the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of antisemitism yes he believed that the jews were enemies of the reich and such a belief is of course typical of patriotic antisemites but he believed in the jewasenemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things
perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer not through fear of disobeying orders as eichmann kept trying to explain but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a halfacceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitlers victories into a permanent lightmindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal and the more outrageous the better well lets try it at any rate the substance of eichmanns testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the ss and though the prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews his success on this score was doubtful and the antisemitic lesson weakened to that extent
this meaning of eichmanns experience in various countries worth highlighting as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence
I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy I told him at which he started slightly and then made us each a stiff drink with a trembling hand I seem to remember he said that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live
the zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a march hare it is manic as a man I woke up this morning moreland said paraphrasing lewis carroll
just barely he said and repeated his paraphrase the time has come the walrus said to speak of manic things of shots and shouts and sealing dooms of commoners and kings moreland fixed us each another drink and said for gods sake tell me something truly amusing
ill try I said and sat for a moment thinking oh yes the other day I reread some of emersons english traits and there was an anecdote about a group of english and americans visiting germany more than a hundred years ago
in the railway station at berlin a uniformed attendant was chanting foreigners this way foreigners this way one woman she could have been either english or american went up to him and said but you are the foreigners
the heart I said finally is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes when it was worn in the breast or even on the sleeve we at least knew where it was
oh I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance recently by the way I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was noninstitutionalized
oh that is demonstrable I told him you remember the woman in the french alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously

if you saw the drama called rhinoceros I said think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros the rhinos would panic screaming help if that can be screamed in their language
you think the russians are getting ahead of us in comedy moreland demanded nongod no I said
such as moreland asked such as sending the cat to guard the mice or the falcon to protect the dove or most terribly sharp of all the human being to save humanity you and I have fallen out of literature into politics moreland observed
the world that was once footloose and fancyfree he said has now become screwloose and frenzyfree in our age of science and angst it seems to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space
the human ego being what it is I put in science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tubenosed fruit bats it seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species
forty years ago an english writer wl george dealt with this subject in eddies of the day and said as an example that saint george for merry england would not start a spirit half so quickly as strike frogeating frenchmen dead there was also gott strafe angleterre moreland reminded me and carthago delenda est or if you will deus strafe carthage
the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity and in particular since this is our special responsibility that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states I speak of the largest possible measure because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved ever reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings and is therefore a dangerous man to have around assumption
it may be of course that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world the absence of soviet communist power the uses of power this much having been said the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do defeat communism and if so how those resources ought to be used
I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment I certainly do but you know any comparison of overall american strength with overall soviet strength finds the united states not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of ussoviet relations for the foreseeable future
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts and I think mr jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth suppose he says that the tables were turned and we were in the soviets position there would be more than modern soviet fighters all better than ours stationed at bases in mexico and the caribbean
this ignorant estimate I repeat is not of any interest in itself but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do namely by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side to the extent then that declining us prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation there is reason for concern
still these guesses about the outcome of the struggle can not be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power of influence if you will about which the relevant questions are is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence communist political warfare we must remember is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages
today africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging it would seem into the soviet orbit latin america was once an area as safe for the west as nebraska was for nixon
if I ever committed suicide she thought I would dive straight down from here and no one would find me for days she smiled and expertly let herself downward holding this known root or that her sneakers sliding in the leaves
hello julie how are you then off he went so casually to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a lowercut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him
I wish he was with me now she thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment oh god I wish I were older or younger julia bentley thought
well he told himself lets put the show on the road he was walking across to the bathroom
he recognized his jacket and trousers the fabric was dark the stains werent too apparent and there were his shoes thank god but his shirt was one terrible mess

im just finishing breakfast but have you told mother you were going she asked him no
well wont you come in then have a cup of coffee or something or maybe a drink she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate and yet perhaps partly scornful
he tried to see her face more clearly no nothing at all he said after a moments hesitation
as a great favor julie he said please dont mention youve seen me not to anyone no please ill call your mother as soon as I get home please you just go ahead she had disappeared
I wish I wasnt wearing this ridiculous costume and that we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we knew he stopped speaking forget we ever knew what oh just sort of everything in general she said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace
I know you feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say does it he asked yes perhaps

ill take you out to dinner okay he had put down the receiver a strange relationship between joan fulbright and himself
he came by and repeated po chavis chapter bong bong startled him awake
the room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it bong a dull boom and a throbbing echo the walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled
he stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon bong he raced to the window and yanked at the sash bong
the wood was old the paint alligatored bong a fresh breeze saluted him six oclock

he was fortunate and proud the veterans idling on their benches in the square beneath the soldiers monument got to their feet when papa approached morning reverend
his being and his will stevie could not divide god from his papa illumined every parish face turned the choir into a band of angels and the pulpit into the tollgate to heaven we have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge mama announced and three hundred and eighty sundayschool scholars

hell make a preacher out of you no he wont stevie flared not me
the way macarthur said his line if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist would probably have gone like this afj primary stresses on emeralds and wish note pitch pretty high on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl one degree of oversoftness conclusions the people involved and subsequent facts bear me out here knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds both monetary and sentimental the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture
to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber the point quite simply is this words they might have had but communication no
this for obvious reasons makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy in the earlys smith together with his distinguished colleague george trager so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm and a third man with the engaging name of birdwhistell ray agreed on some basic premises about the threepart process that makes communication words or language paralanguage a set of phenomena including laughing weeping voice breaks and tone of voice and kinesics the technical name for gestures facial expressions and body shifts nodding or shaking the head talking with ones hands et cetera
the usual us norm would be afj middle pitches slight pause juncture before mother slight rise at the end the symbols of mothers status here are all usual for culture usa
quite other feelings are evidenced by this style afj note the drop to pitch the lowest on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence this is a fade ending and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech expressing something less than conventional respect for mother even less regard for mom and moms apple pie goes with afj
his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient in one nowhistoric first interview for example the transcript reproduced from the book the first five minutes goes like this the therapists level tone is bland and neutral he has for example avoided stressing you which would imply disapproval or surprise which would set the patient apart from other people
the patient on the other hand is far from neutral aside from her specifically regional accent she reveals by the use of the triad irritable tense depressed a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ie she must have had at least a highschool education and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before then she catapults into everything and everybody putting particular violence on everybody indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag that is it is not congruent to the patients general style of speech up to this point
when someone says for example they took xrays to see that there was nothing wrong with me it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made this patient in actuality was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty amateur linguists note here that pursewarden in durrells alexandria quartet stammered when he spoke of his wife which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship
olgivanna in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address was not only attractive but shrewd durable sensible and smart no wonder wright was enchanted no two better suited people ever met almost from that day until his death olgivanna was to stay at his side but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying both for wright and his montenegrin lady
first wright said he was choked by the smoke which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town surely michigan avenue was handsome
this exhausted wrights patience and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite volstead laws speed laws divorce laws he said as they now stand demoralize the individual make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd
alexander walked away naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor
their strategy was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip spencers unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated when the mast was raised alexander gave the order for small and cromwell to be placed under arrest and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers
well heiser ventured why dont we hold an investigation with questioning and that would be worse than useless alexander broke in
we are going to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound of course I agree with the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate
now the hope was gone yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price dear god at what a price
he said captain may I speak please captain I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship you cromwell yes sir before god I swear I am innocent
surely captain you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything no cromwell I did not find your name
I tell you he is innocent do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word yes
I thought midshipman rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him geometry it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom where a class of apprentices awaited him
would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming o gogol o chekhov o thackeray and dickens what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plasterofparis ducks a birdbath and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps
offer her a cup of tea and she would say why these cups look just like a set I gave to the salvation army last year show her the new swimming pool and she would say slapping her ankle I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes
hand her a chair and she would say why its a nice imitation of those queen anne chairs I inherited from grandmother delancy these trumps were more touching than they were anything else and seemed to imply that the nights were long her children ungrateful and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare
she took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and walking with very small steps started toward the door oh please come in she said
and I am not sure that I have any cash any money that is but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook you step into the living room where its cozier

mr justice taneys dred scott decision in was unpopular in the north and soon became a dead letter prohibition was the law of the land but it was unpopular how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days drinking was so gay so fashionable especially in the sophisticated northeast and was repealed
to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority calhoun developed his theory of concurrent majority which he said by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government a negative on the others prevents all partial or local legislation who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community that regional peculiarities do not still exist that the court order does not unequally affect the southern region
southern liberals there are a good many especially if theyre rich often exhibit blithe insouciance the trouble here is that its almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesnt cost you anything
im talking about the grand manner of the liberal north and south who is not affected personally if these people were denied a voice do they have a moral right to a voice what voices would be left
who is involved willy nilly well after everybody has followed the new england pattern of segregating ones children into private schools only the poor folks are left
being a teacher of american literature I remembered whittiers massachusetts to virginia where he said but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown there is a legend hawthorne records it in his english notebooks and one finds it again in thomas nelson page to the effect that the mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of negro slaves

robert penn warren puts it this way in brother to dragons the recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence where innocence I think means about the same thing as redemption a man must be able to say father I have sinned or there is no hope for him
new englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration of independence as jefferson explained in his autobiography the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of africa was struck out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves and who on the contrary still wished to continue it our northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures for though their people had very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others
george w cable naturalized new englander writing in from paradise road northampton lovely symbolic name agitated continuously the southern question it was nice to be able to isolate it
it a bit odd that the three states of southern new england massachusetts connecticut and rhode island have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past these institutions having previously been a & m colleges it supposed perchance that a & m vocational training that is was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the new england world in the postcivil war period the immigrants having been brought in from southern europe to work in the mills to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the west

the liberalconservative division we might observe in passing is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration

despite this danger however we are informed on every hand that ideas not machines are our finest tools they are priceless even though they can not be recorded on a ledger page they are the most valuable of commodities and the most salable for their demand far exceeds supply so allimportant are ideas we are told that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes those who invent new ideas of their own and those who borrow beg or steal from others harris j griston in shaking the dust from shakespeare writes there is not a word spoken by shylock which one would expect from a real jew he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone
research on the other hand has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful some far better than the real mothers helen deutsch informed us the psychology of women vol that in all cultures the term stepmother automatically evokes deprecatory implications a conclusion accepted by many mere debate on that proposition even though it be free and untrammeled remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold

I cant wait no two weeks and mr skyros didnt like angie but what with prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely to come out and angie such a valuable salesman prettyman said all the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys why did everything have to happen at once denny said stupidly why you aint turning angie down are you mr skyros
I mean we all figured I guess anybodyd figure angie angelo gave him an affectionate smile
oh god the name repeated over and over anybody to hear not being a fool mr skyros knew why aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held you could say the whip hand and all because of domokous

while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience satiety might well be an equal handicap no she would not pretend modesty but neither must she be crudely bold
for a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind very well she said ill not catechize you
as he declaimed the sonorous measures it was as much as claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings although it is not the best of which he is capable said shelley as he closed the book it is still poetry of a high order
the collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves it is I am reliably given to understand the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ie burglars who rob while the tenants are absent in contrast to hotslough prowlers those who work while the occupants are home
hastening to the attic the temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet some khaki pants and the like and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there what you were looking for unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens eludes me but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumedoak victrola you danced two tangos and a paso doble which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu
you then descended one story glommed a television set from the music room the only constructive feature of your visit by the way and returning to the ground floor entered the master bedroom from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath you abstracted seventeen ivory metal wood and stone sculptures of oriental and african origin two snuffboxes and a jadehandled magnifying glass
rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby you unearthed an antique french chess set in ivory and sandalwood which along with two box kodaks you added to your haul then having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on you lammed out the front door considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover so much for the tiresome facts as familiar to you im sure as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake
the foregoing aided by several clues ill withhold to keep you on your toes will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector javert but before they close in gird yourselves I repeat for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches

his interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian affairs although he still didnt speak to anyone he grew fond of saying the future lies in asia when the opportunity arose and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new york to give him a foundation they said for his life in asian studies
yes he lied to shorten the conversation I still have it he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father no matter the subject

sushi was out because it was pretentious sashimi was in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to stay out even if it was a little pretentious
well I was able to do it charlotte said with no sign of irritation for a minute anyhow im surprised no one has been there
theres a little place there called lovers mound dedicated to gompachi and komurasaki yes a little parkish place charlotte said and concluded anyhow its all very nice
the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo oh thats what I meant to tell you

and the water would be still colder ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it your golden god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath
it would kill one of us the point is charlotte said there he was freezing naked in a little stream of water at ryusenji all in worship of fudo the god of fire
he left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundredyen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze but the spirit he wished to call out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest

I granted this might be so but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously and why not how I asked could chaos be admitted to chaos
I responded could not similar things be said about the art of the past it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we can not clarify demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own neverpredictable way
this lifedeath question a part of the chaos yes if life and death did not both present themselves to us there would be no inscrutability

the race problem has tended to obscure other less emotional issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive it is these other differences between north and south other that is than those which concern discrimination or social welfare which I chiefly discuss herein
I am naive they say to make use of such words I take this to mean that the intelligent and therefore necessarily cynical liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it
in our case and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration nor are we given to emotional outbursts the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south because it is not easy for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down
apart from racial problems the old unreconstructed south to use the moderate words favored by mr thomas griffith finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the north this in effect means most of modern america
it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise therein I feel many northerners delude themselves about the south
rourke was talking on the phone when he came back about an hour eh you positive
id better keep on driving yours shayne decided because ill be going on over to the beach I can drop you back here to pick mine up
this deal at las putas buenas where the two knifemen jumped you said rourke with interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought by the luscious mrs peralta doesnt it it does shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his in the green jungle parking lot
shayne asked peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign rourke could see it better out the righthand side and he said yes
turn to the left I think for that number you gave me not more than a block or so shayne got in the lefthand lane and cut across the boulevard divider
why the two damned fools got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out cold shayne said goodhumoredly theyll have fun explaining that to the miami cops
oh she was just the maid there he replied waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was kirby was of course reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders
true it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations the actions of bridget should be examined since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her innocence

someone on his staff he suspected it was ed thornburg intercepted them and for this andy was grateful he finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used and didnt awaken until early afternoon
he snapped to alertness at andys entrance sorry mr paxton nothing new lot of people waiting to see you though reporters our own people questions about the show tonight hub picked up the telephone
raymond fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed cradle song in case it was needed charlie marble was back and forth on several occasions first to confer with andy on the advisability of cancelling the las vegas engagement they decided it was wise and later to announce that a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casinos open date sure I know its such a long shot no longer than yours
dont try to stop me either someday bonner said youre going to ask us for help bake asked theyre drinking arent they no
thornburg added in a lower voice but andy overheard they act more like a jury than an audience andy said well I guess we cant wait any longer
thornburg patted his arm sure andy itll be all right nothing broken that cant be mended
even rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel he was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two were intertwined and could not be separated
he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer had participated in one or two battles he never went into detail regarding his military experience and at the age of twentyfive quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a christian rector was often curious often tempted to ask questions but he never did
he was even more startled when he heard what kayabashi wanted the oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries the secretary said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi wished to show them the mission
rector laughed despite himself unless the oyabun has been working on it he said then checked himself and added you can tell kayabashisan that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use arigato gosaimasu
at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity no kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived
fifteen she said no only fourteen the little ito girl had had to go home
no sir johnson said you are about to become a firstclass surveyor rector said
somehow managing to get out a cool poised wont you hold on a second please I covered up the mouthpiece and with more warmth and less poise gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter including devils island and the remoter reaches of siberia I promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed
it seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace and quiet instead of carrying out my threats resolving to get something done I started in on the dishes no
they had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners and for information as to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter to call not that there was much of a choice since catatonia was just a village the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly thin they were personalities
herb an expert on narrow ties thin lapels and swatches was mens fashion editor of parvenu the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from nebraska or was it wyoming
she was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile then put some money into a broadway show which was successful terrible but successful
it was during her writing period that she and herb met and decided that they were in love they were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda no not bermuda
they had bought their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding new york they had chosen catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names you are bound to get involved with people when you have children fran had told me at our first meeting so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands but people who do things
I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldnt escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things their house was a centuriesold colonial which they had had restored guided by an eminent architect and updated and added on to
it had a gourmets corner instead of a kitchen a breakfast room a luncheon room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud it was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room paint in the painting room play with blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time
their two boys were well adjusted and like their parents always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences francesca and herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects expensive but not necessarily valuable contemporary things
yes blanche was very very sweet being in her company was like being drowned in warm melted marshmallows I had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness oh my souffle has collapsed
anyone knows how a real redblooded woman would react to such a catastrophe if blanche had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of doors and thrown a few little valueless things but dear me no not blanche
each had developed a hairtrigger chuckle and the habit of saying zounds in deference to countrysquirehood I never thought id live to hear people chuckle and say zounds in real life
they were always leaping to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves sanitary bake shops o pioneers I thought and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier pioneers who looked like offduty gardeners even at parentteacher conferences and who never called the school principal mister
I sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ u yearly people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on person to person people who thought it was nice to be important but not important to be nice who were more ingratiating than gracious more personalities than persons in my estimation they were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka well not discussed him exactly but said kafka reverently and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about kafka not having read kafka
they were I felt people invariably trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine what not who others were becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime I brought myself back to the tasks at hand
I dug around and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a devilsfood cake with chocolate icing sometimes I think you need only one rule for cooking if you cant put garlic in it put chocolate in it the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing
she was most strange woman ready to follow her impulse it was an impulse when she was here in mea shearim I was with her that led her to stay in israel
then his son did something rachel threw up her hands I dont know what but something to an official here it was during the mandate and the son was imprisoned a few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed
in fact some sensitives rule this out preferring to consider their expression as strictly extrasensory perception esp on this side of the veil however that may be people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons
it is not really only a conversation many a sitter in a personal sitting has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind
dr karlis osis director of research at the parapsychology foundation described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article new research on survival after death spring he remarked it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter
if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name given by the experimenter he can not possibly give any clues conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions
sometimes in these experiments appointment sittings are used here the absent sitter makes a date with a communicator someone close to him who is deceased asking him to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for him
one sitter may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed to him to another it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase atta boy to get around this quite difficult corner there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him
after the sitting has been held several readings at one time are mailed and the distant sitter whose name or whose communicators name was given to the medium must mark each little item as correct hit incorrect miss doubtful or especially significant applying to him and he feels not to anyone else he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his
now when so to speak the cream has been skimmed off and the items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the sensitive is at her best mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses
I feel cold the medium says or my leg aches my head is heavy perhaps she hears words or sounds theres such a noise of loud machinery or I hear a child crying or he says were all here and glad to see you
it is still a college only and not a university it is in fact the only college in the ivy group however three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums the dartmouth medical school third oldest in the country and founded in the thayer school of engineering and the amos tuck school of business administration
perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us temporarily anyway the sleeping poet and in poets can discover their immortality is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul
in any case miss millays sweetthroated bitterness her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love her constant and wonderfully tragic posture so unlike that of fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props drew from the me that I was when I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea but all this I am well aware is the bel canto of love and although I have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that I listened I know well enough that it was not
at the same time I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign since theirs is a science of paradox if one hates they say it is because one loves if one bullies they say it is because one is afraid if one shuns they say it is because one desires and according to them whatever one fancies one feels what one feels in fact is the opposite well normally abnormal or normally normal neurotic or merely fastidious do the tealeaf readers by the way allow psyches to have moral taste I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion
I fled however not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom in the sense you meant the word things which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which I had already insisted upon finding out for myself despite I may now say the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle yes on principle and in cold blood because I was resolved as a modern woman not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize life by the throat I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of selfbetrayal
however I confess my hope that I will be innocent again not with a pristine accidental innocence but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone innocence of all the graces of the spirit is I believe the one most to be prayed for
although it is constantly made to look foolish too simple to come in out of the rain people say who have found in the innocent an impediment it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best and when they seem worst it overlooks them
when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust innocence can falter since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it the innocence of which I speak is I know not incorruptible
here if anywhere it is not wholly incontrovertible to you for instance the word innocence in this connotation probably retained its biblical or should I say technical sense and therefore I suppose I must make myself quite clear by saying that I lost or rather handed over what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before I was legally entitled and in fact by oath required to hand it over along with what other goods and bads I had
I knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time I acquired it today these many years later after all the temptations resisted or yielded to the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured I call it corrupting still you I could swear to it remained innocent in this sense until the end
moreover because of the particular blot on your family escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your grandmothers part and because you had the leanto kitchen and trundle bed of your childhood to outgrow what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person what you bent your whole will sensibility and intelligence upon was to be a lady before being daughter wife or mother before being cultured a word now bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen bestowed on it before being sorry for the poor progressive about public health and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian indeed first and foremost you were a lady
there was of course more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your minds eye than the sine qua non of her virtue a lady you made clear to me both by precept and example never raised her voice or slumped in her chair never failed in social tact in heaven for instance would not mention st john the baptists head never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture never indulged in public scenes or private confidences never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering never gossiped or maligned never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself
nope just you all the time sometimes I think its the only way ill ever get a decent partner ramey smiled but he thought to himself I always see me too never benny
all right step back the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him
the child was gone when juanita awoke kate was still rocking the dead child still crooning in disbelief no no oh no
the men were restive he wrote ready to take the battle to the enemy as jackson wished the peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in wheeling which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors
after he had gone kate asked uncle randolph proudly would you take their oath the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said hell yes I think ive taken it about fifty times already winking at joels look of shock
her mother wrote kate of her grief at the death of kates baby and at jonathans decision to go with the south and dear kate she wrote poor dr breckenridges son robert is now organizing a militia company to go south to his good fathers sorrow maj anderson of fort sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the us army
its your decision said juanita holding her face very still trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly no the decision is yours
your evening free madame I said with noblesse oblige because of the handsome yeah
I had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils so help me then switched to tuborg after a few hours life hadnt showed and I was crocked
I didnt have on a hat hardly glancing at her I smiled a bleak one which said thanks baby but id rather be alone
she must have seen the ring on my left hand well women and unhappiness go together I observed profoundly adding you can wager your derriere on that
ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it this took me so funny I had to look at her
her eyes were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them now isnt it better to smile she asked
im sorry I havent got a glass I said non non she said taking the bottle not for that be sorry
we finished the bottle I hadnt had a lot out of it earlier not speaking much to each other and we stayed sober I suppose we were cold but we didnt feel it
yeah but breakfast first with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom why to brush your teeth I already have
um I grunted sipping yes because you didnt run off to use that new toothbrush I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror
im taking them to the cemetery said henrietta out of a vague feeling of hospitality theyll be takin me next he said pleasantly but not so soons they plan
every month fr three days he said happily I take no water into my system no water whatsoever it rests the tissues
henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense rests the tissues he said and pacifies the system
well she had not come back to great island to be understood praised or condemned she had come to make her peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow
if it aint an idea she said how comes it you can drink beer but not water he looked piously to heaven and said beer dont affect the tissues none and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence
the woman she must have been a tiny baby when hetty and delia had stood arm in arm watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own god rest her soul she was a sweet one
come on now she put a strong hand under the old mans arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old
she felt mindless walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them how many things had lessened while she was gone away but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named dorothy tredding seemed suddenly impossible

he wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared at clayton in a childish kind of wonder you mean he asked almost shyly you want me to go with you wherever youre goin yes

mr rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one preferably said carl one battered and worn such as might be found in a pawnshop they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller of sixth avenue
mr miller was in the shop the herald tribune story related but was reluctant to have anybodys picture taken inside because his business was too confidential for pictures but after introductions he asked carl sandburg well you can pose inside
he wanted mr sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully kalamazoo guitars he said used by radio hillbilly singers he chose one from mr millers window a plain guitar with no fancy polish
one fame is precious and luminous another is a bubble of a bauble ah did you once see shelley plain
mrs sandburg received a phi beta kappa key from the university of chicago and she was busy writing and teaching when she met sandburg you are the peoples poet was her appraisal in and she stopped teaching and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husbands career
she read everything else she could get her hands on including an article she thinks it was in the atlantic monthly by mark twain on white slavery paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in chapel
eugene was not entirely silent or openly rude unless asking harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness it went right on creaking under his own considerable weight and all it needed harold thought was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it
oh no harold said shocked well this is france after all
I dont know what im going to do with you its because we are in france he said and know so few people

okay what happened about nine this morning mrs buck phones me shes having trouble with one of her farm hands money trouble colored fellow named tim williams only hand she has working for her now

whos your witness julia had has an old indian woman cooking for her nellie harris probably the last of the original island indians

moore said come on jed I have to get to my men on my way out I told her if you should eh just happen to see your husband get him to give himself up
hell get a fair trial hiding out like this wont get him anything except more trouble or a bullet yes
for another moment we didnt talk then she began to weep she mumbled I just know that chief moore is out to kill my tim maybe
it became the sole subject of international law a term which it is pertinent to remember was coined by bentham a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world arena that corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
the surface hide a quite different picture the short answer to those questions is yes
a dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road and the thirst of some of the men which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it isaac pitt one of the men from lincoln had taken a musket ball in his belly and though he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on the ground dying the reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow
good heavens adam he said I thought one thing youd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place I learned that now I said
gods name what are you to rob the dead with the fight going on cousin simmons roared they tried to outface him but joseph simmons was as wide as two average men and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him
hell in a year or five or ten the boy will have forgotten me his own father to take him and leave his mother behind is not good
that I cant answer for I cant imagine something like this happening to me maybe I should withdraw my advice no
if the bluff failed and they ran into trouble brannon had told the others they would withdraw and he would come after his son another time he didnt want to put himself outside the law
dont start anything you cant finish now listen macklin began put your gun on the desk marshal now hold on damn it I wont
get it out damned if I will brannon youve assaulted a law officer and he turned to his platoon okay men he said
his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face ekstrohm ryan insisted okay
well lets take a groundlevel look at the country around here the facsiport rolled open on the landscape
ekstrohm nudged it with a boot hey this is pretty close to a warthog
uhhuh ryan admitted one of the best matches ive ever found well it has to happen statistical average and all
of course thats not definite proof no it isnt ekstrohm said
actually they said he did sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot others admitted he was absolutely correct he never slept
the angry burntred face of ryan greeted him okay stormy this isnt the place for fun and games
youve been riding on a pink ticket for six years you know that no ekstrohm said no I didnt know that
it was not a new experience to ekstrohm no suspicion wasnt new to him at all
there was no need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show concern or stoicism it was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came
oh whats the matter with me he demanded when he had stored his stock in the great oak chest locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up the darkening street
he thought I am a jew from bavaria he was standing there he thought in virginia in the thickening dusk in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another jew adam nodded yeah mose murmured yeah
what is it he asked chicken mose said and theatrically licked his lips gret big fat chicken yeah
he licked his lips again then yeah a chicken with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew it squealed for slop
mose giggled fooled you huh it is the same ole same tell me its name
it is salt pok and skippers that pok it was so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say hoopig
I did not perceive this essential distinction either firstborn hesperus said at once I was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal nevertheless you were its agent
we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given his heart he discovered was pounding
though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us hesperus and lucifer jack said show that we do
yes those could be commodities under this concept you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery
visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older this explained a great deal all the more reason then jack said why we must have a treaty
jack scanned the skies the boards and the skies again nothing no there was a tiny pip on the radar and it was getting bigger rapidly
the curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldnt be argued with however the skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula toward that place which jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angels life and religion hesperus dont use this ttau vector trick of yours please
japan has had destructive ones eight of them disastrous since the hawaiian islands are struck severely an average of once every years
in an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the inland sea one wave swamped more than ships and boats in osaka bay a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in washed away an entire town ponoluu leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been
the waves are separated by intervals of minutes to an hour or more because of their great length and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over the waves may keep coming for many hours
he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves their onrush and retreat he reported was accompanied by a great hissing roaring and rattling
at that afternoon greenwich time the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in honolulu the warning system immediately went into action
within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in alaska arizona and california the quakes epicenter was placed at degrees north latitude and degrees east longitude while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water the hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at greenwich time
the policemans eyes rather popped for a second but then arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasnt for these dear children the policeman got a confused funny look on his face and he had answered kind of politely now look here lady I know you got to entertain these kids and all
this is a public park and its a city ordinance that the statues can not be crawled on arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said yes sir
then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous smile she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling she would wink and throw kisses
this time arlene said and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking youre going to tell me what I am and what im doing it all has something to do with general burnside and his horse
I suppose you all were playing and forgot yes maam the children chorused heartily
he was forced to wipe his eyes you dont step on the flowers do you eh
we were coming to an intersection turning right chuffing to a stop forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old mexican moriarty new mexico gracias
whiteshirted and conservativelycravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze suddenly a treble auto horn tootleytoottootled and thumbing hopefully I saw emergent in windshield flash red lips streaming silk of blonde hair and ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension despair the leering face of old herry
moreeairteeeee he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde over the rapidlydiminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage herrys black brushcut was just discernible near or enviably near that spot where hidden more delicatelytextured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes
damn his luck I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and well at least I wouldnt have shouted back a taunt
how far I knew will shortly become apparent let me pass over the trip to sante fe with something of the same speed which made mrs roebuck wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit mph is still in eefaket
I let up on the accelerator only to gradually reach again the mph which would I hoped overhaul herry and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I mrs major roebuck settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody in sante fe when johnson ejaculated howsabout my buying us all a nice cold cocola maam mrs roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh a little younguh than you bawhs
ah n ansuh him an so ah said aw right ah gayess an his fathuh n uttuh one wohd an aftuh huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink tgethuh ovuh a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn mah back an ah n think thets nahce at all you no I dont johnson said
im a good baptist and drinking mrs roebuck very kindly let me drive through sante fe to a road which would she said lead us to taos and then raton and eventshahleh out of new mexico
the truck was hurtling forward I seized the rack and made a westernstyle flyingmount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag and merely wrecking my camera I was to discover later my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and but this is no medical report
the way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear a beer hell yes I roared back between dusty lips I want a beer I nodded hell thats all right buddy the indian I now guessed said
drink your beer miraculously the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my luckily waterproof watch
I tossed the bottle high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the cars steel roof too high on unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash ayeyahahah
the indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief probably only a fraction of johnsons the bottle this time went to the indians lips another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill
a workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didnt wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it mr mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and twobyfours which properly handled would he had assured him turn into a workbench
no he didnt know of any handymancarpenter there wasnt any such thing any more
now he said we got to put in some outlets for them power tools then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an I guess were about through down here it all did look very efficient and shipshape
there was no question of that by the way said mr blatz packing his tools into a battered carrier them power tools needs extra voltage
well he said got your man fixed up nice down there he oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions
mr crombie couldnt remember his saying any such thing oh thats wonderful cried mrs crombie come a bit closer I wont bite you know
another youth madame the coachman said softly this one is a tender chicken oui such delicate beauty such fine flesh
really you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself he said frowning with displeasure delphine presented her cheek for a kiss and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster
our objective the colonel had said that day of the briefing is papasan there the objective sat brooding over all
if he were to go with white he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some point between here and papasan but moving ever deeper into enemy land behind papasan itself this what he had expected
its safe prevot had said and it provides cover for our noise soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night
and then the questions came eager interested questions and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity it ever bother you warren had asked to have people always asking you about your hands
oh the french are a very curious people pierre had laughed they are also honest seekers after truth
now the english are painfully silent about my missing hands they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there
it will be good for you I think too he said his dark eyes mischievous that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken
within two weeks warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate the monk who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception I speak english the old man said but I do not hear it very well you please wait in here
I decided I hated the pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldnt watch dying just to entertain hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling oh hed not care about the pedersen kid
the covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but his face was turned to the wall there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster and I thought well you dont look much like a pigdrunk bully now I couldnt be sure he was still asleep oh he was smart it put you off
pa was on his side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow get the hell out of here get the hell out of here big hans sent me he found the pedersen kid by the crib get the hell out
hes got him in the kitchen pedersen no pa its the pedersen kid the kid nothing to steal from the crib not stealing pa what did he come for hey god dammit get
hes an even bigger fool than you are fat hey I taught him dammit and ill teach you out dont be smart you ask him about the whisky yeah well
well get your pa and get that whisky pa dont care about the kid jorge
well he dont he dont care at all and I dont care to get my head busted neither
it should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for big hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with pas yellow sick insides no you wont big hans said
yes hans if theyre needed ma said hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her
she had surprised hans like she had surprised me when she said shed go and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and hans was holding it angrily by the throat oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm
now hans had given ma something of his we both had when we thought she was going straight to pa something valuable but since she didnt know wed given it to her there was no easy way of getting it back hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap
hans poured some in a tumbler you going to put more towels on him no why not
big hans began pouring whisky in the kids mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin here help me prop him up ok im lifting I took him by the shoulders
dont hold him like that put your arms around him well jesus
like eliot in my fantasies I had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely continental I would lead jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently to the nights climax which in my dreams was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses burning with love the night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle it must have been late in september I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from the front nearly dying my head bandaged and blooded and jessica bending over me the power of her love bringing me back to life
in december I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the hotel astor a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated we would attend a film and later on I stated we might go to the mayflower coffee shop or childs or toffenettis for waffles
oh ive known him quite a while she glanced at her companion fondly
havent I george ive been after her for years needham said but ive never been able to get anywhere until the last few days
ill have to give it some thought he said you wouldnt want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would you
then as he turned toward the telephone it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly yeah he said casey yeah tony calenda
calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his boys close at hand so with my trial coming up in federal court next week I wouldnt want that picture published
he specifies in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism in every period it has been humanism and let me add utopianism also
that john lockes philosophy of the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration of independence I believe we generally accept after rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will the same philosophy it may be said became the idea source of the french revolution also
we of the liberalled world got all set for peace and rehabilitation then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight an irrational an indecent an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest and some had thought noblest ally
during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal during the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of containment and the bitterest irony enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon the atom bomb
in it will be remembered the gop without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly all of this I know is recent history familiar to you
lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue and I select this sentence as its pertinent summation in essence the drama of his eisenhowers presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling thus far with but limited and precarious success to give effective voice and force to that conservatism
obviously there has been no agreement on what american conservatism is or rather what it should be it was neglected not to say nascent when the struggle began
one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election I suppose is that we the majority were dissatisfied with eisenhower conservatism to be sure we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment
let me add murrays new book as another symptom of it particularly so in view of the attention time magazine gave it when it came out recently father murray goes back to the declaration of independence too though I may add with considerably more historical perception
I will reserve discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy as symptomatic of the common mans malaise he is most significant a liberal and a catholic elected by the skin of his teeth that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy not to say confused state of the public mind
among them are frederick j hoffman william van oconnor and mrs olga vickery they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough I believe in pointing out faulkners independence his questioning if not indeed challenging the southern tradition
that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions of course that he is steeped in them in fact or that he has dealt with them in his books it is to say rather I believe that he has brought to bear on the history the traditions and the lore of his region a critical skeptical mind the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique
some of us might be inclined to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation either mental or physical are particularly southern traits there is no necessity I suppose to assert that mr faulkner is southern
a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made I think by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region the planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton kennedy published swallowbarn in and in his genial portrait of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature
it would be profitable I believe to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkners works the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time to faulkners time such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality in the south and moreover is following a longestablished literary precedent
the press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking rather than his convictions he commented thoughtfully a reporter told us that it was not too important for the individual how he ends up
the stiffly regal look of them she saw grimly lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string please come down as soon as you conveniently can the upright letters stalked from the broadnibbed pen I have an important matter to discuss with you to abel I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here
I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters you may stay as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in to mark please give my regards to myra
yes she said I remember that they came here every summer I used to play with the older one sometimes when hed let me abel
theres no greater catastrophe in the universe she reflected dourly impaling tender green beans on the silver fork than the dwindling away of a family procreation expansion proliferation these are the laws of living things with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments oblivion
when the fate of the individual is visited on the group then the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ah then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth
she was the last living of the older generation what had once been a widespread family at one time she knew there were enough packards to populate an entire county had now narrowed down to the two boys abel and mark
she didnt mention bringing myra mark said maneuvering the car into the next lane shes probably getting old crotchety I mean and we figured uhuh better not
oh no he said and he was without humor now ive had enough of that
they had almost everything they needed land a house two whiteface bulls three horses the land wasnt all wilson had expected of it six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st louis had said good grass good water
well the grass was there though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it the water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard
the place had been cheap just the little he had left after amelias burial and it would serve its purpose there was only one place where jake carwoods description had gone badly awry the peace and quiet
it hadnt started out that way he had a feeling thanks to the girl that things would get worse before they got better
there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard yes there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble ill call her no thank you
I have these appointments in town for saturday and ill probably spend sunday with dolly or the thaxters at last I thought shes recovering her spirits
its so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night so poetic with all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock a misstep
I could tell them but no one ever asked why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body no I forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened
if they say I could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of selfexamination her search into herself and its conclusions yes I had cried out that I knew shed do it but without my fully realizing it at the time it was a cry of triumph for her praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed and guilt
then via called to say they had decided to cremate her as they had ellen the thought leaped to my mind and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses I had ordered
I knelt just for decency I thought at the time but found myself whispering our father which art in heaven and it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief via was in the parking lot when I went outside
I wouldnt even be surprised she said unhappily if myra tried to leave her with us forever myra loved big cities thousands of miles away in paris of all places she might forget she had ever been a mother
lucy was sick of it well at last she said because susan was clattering down the stairs
shell take every one of them jim groaned but he lifted susans suitcase and said in a gentler tone sure the entire thousand
at this point lucy thought there should be a lecture on little cousins sharing dolls but she could sympathize with susan there ought to be a limit to sharing too that was one more reason she didnt look forward to cathys visit short or long the last one had been a lilliputian war
she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had well jim said out of the silence lets get going dolls and all
well lucy she said to herself abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds she had a day of things to do among them she had to prepare the guest room
ive been fixing up the guest room for cathy there was a momentary pause and then her mother said how long is she supposed to stay just for a couple of weeks till myra finds a place for them well this time there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life
cathy was in tears of course and I heard myra say now be good and at christmastime ill send you a wonderful present from paris shocked speechless lucy sat there
no but the fats in the fire mike said theres no chance now of all of us getting away
mclish he said as he kicked the horse into motion id be a mighty sad man if we never met again then he was on his way at a gallop
there may be a case of this sort but it is not one we wish to argue here even if people do in a not far distant future begin to read one anothers minds there will still be the question of whether what you find in another mans mind is especially worth reading worth more that is than what you can read in good books
each man that is is both one and many he is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time
mr lyford gives voice to a temper that represents we think an achieved plateau of reflective thinking after casting about for a way of describing this spirit we decided that it would be better to use mr lyfords introduction as an illustration
the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great and it does not escape the notice of others if our sincerity is granted and it is granted the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest selfexamination
however we come finally to explain and account for the present the truth we are trying to expose right now is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises the host is the flowing life of the human race
we were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come very pure and elevated he has said in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of instead of this thes witnessed a tragic economic depression the rise of fascist dictators in europe the wasting civil war in spain
he had taken out first papers for american citizenship but after war came to europe he decided to return to france arriving there in january I hated the war he said but thought I ought to go because I was perhaps one of those who hadnt done enough to prevent it
in the stalag helion came to know and love his comrades most of them plain folk who in their extremity showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape
you know summers he said thoughtfully eagles nest ought to have a fire company
tell her to hurry yes sir his face pale summers headed for the street
that long ride the four of you took mustve given him a good appetite now turn around so I can see your face jess stiffened I dont know nothin about him no
so help me crouch id like to kill you where you stand but before I do im going to hear you admit killing him now start talking
having all the guns makes you a big man dont it adams if we was both armed you wouldnt talk so tough no all right crouch were on even terms now draw
I aint a gunslinger no youre the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club
louder said joyce uhhuh I can hear you while im checkin the car
he waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her expectantly well you goin to say somethin then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary silence maybe you could write it down for me huh
print it in real big letters an I can cipher it out later aah go on she said
he wore no gun a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country never hed once told joyce had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun
neither was he very powerful of build he could move very quickly she knew although he seldom found occasion to do so but he was more wiry than truly strong
by gosh I want him and im going to have him he caught her eye came back around the car with the bootwearer teetering halfmincing walk oh cut it out tom she snapped
now are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk might get there faster walkin lord drawled seein as how I got a busted front spring
theres nothing out here but rattlesnakes now aint it the truth well lets get going she said impatiently I
getting the boss rattlesnake to help you why I meant what I said lord declared
what else would I mean anyways she looked at him lips compressed
well ill tell you about that lord told him we aim t be seelective y know
I just do what im told and uhhuh that could mean trouble with a fella thats workin for crooks
ill get around to it a little later he mumbled desperately just as soon as I go to the bank and huhuh now mister mcbride said lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field bosss arm
he could no longer think of facesaving of honor but only of escape why hes going to kill me he thought wildly
this he was sure was the way they would act laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death nothing would be done about it nothing unless donna donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him
other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up row by row in the buses his requesting and often getting higher wages better working conditions better schools changes that were slowly emerging even before the supreme court decision of then came this decision which sped the process of gaining equality or perhaps hindered it only historical evolution will determine which an abrupt change
it is clear that while most writers enjoy picturing the negro as a woollyheaded humble old agrarian who mutters yassuhs and sho nufs with blissful deference to his white employer or in old south terms massuh this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as caldwells lester while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through the rural south such men appear to be a vanishing breed
writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro type presenting an individualized negro character it would seem is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could tackle and the success of such an endeavor is as suggested above glaringly rare
as john t westbrook says in his article twilight of southern regionalism southwest review winter the miasmal mausoleum where an old south already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry should be left to rest in peace forever dead and let us fervently hope forever done with westbrook further bemoans the southern writers creation of an unreal image of their homeland which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting yankees our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence of urbanization presented to his senses
willard thorp in his new book american writing in the twentieth century observes quite validly it seems certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what herrick dreiser and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did for new york
I could use some help morgan said finally but I cannt afford to pay you anything I guess youd better go on in the morning
I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep oh she stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said then she murmured youre very kind mr morgan
youll have to go to town to see the doc no shell be all right jones said quickly
I mean we dont have any way to get there and we cannt expect you to quit work just to take us to town well see morgan said
ah yes his half of a refrigerator stood outside on the curving veranda between unit number three and unit number four it was still raining and mrs kirbys cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue and green and magenta
he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed distrust of women once burned scalded really because vivian had given him every encouragement forever shy from now on his was going to be a mans world the north woods duck blinds at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries
thought id bake it out in the sun ah she studied him briefly
all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a lonely old age if he lived that long he leafed through the light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests four separate adventures of the bobbsey twins at the seashore at the mountains on the farm and in danger and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoofandmouth disease in cattle hideously illustrated
he didnt want to encourage anything here but on the other hand he didnt want her swiping his salami not onions came the answer the following day ugh take vivian yes take vivian
they would be black or white or horseblanket plaid chic and splashy like vivian herself pink vivian once had told him was for baby girls and grownup girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy
why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator he mused aloud eh it was mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails whats that you say oh nothing just glad the rains stopped oh yes she scrutinized him my youre peaked
the sun blazing hot as prophesied was far from kind to mrs kirbys varicolored properties when charlie came up from the beach for his fouroclock pill the whole establishment gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog looked like a floodlit modern painting great blocks of dizzy color punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators
this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued retreat with cape roses maybe at the door he could not imagine a flowers being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and the rest
it gave him a good feeling mmm thanks was her answer the next day
gee neither do I charlie grinned she didnt sound like a pale girl
all too frequently points out james ogara managing editor of commonweal catholics run roughshod over protestant sensibilities in this matter by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and particularly by their jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades all too often our language is unduly harsh
the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting already existing between catholics and noncatholics concerning the overall objectives of family planning instead of catholics being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring as many noncatholics imagine the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed
there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement the grounds for the churchs position are scriptural old testament the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law
the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive entirely apart from scripture in determining the ethical character of birthprevention methods the roman catholic naturallaw tradition regards as selfevident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end
in the lambeth conference repeated its condemnation of contraception and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception together with the grave dangers physical moral and religious thereby incurred and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the conference declared we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage
as to the necessity the committee declared for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children and consequently of control of conception there can be no question there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right
since then many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared it at times to be a religious duty what determines the morality they state is not the means used but the motive
in general the means excluding abortion that prove most effective are considered the most ethical this development is reflected in the action taken in february by the general board of the national council of churches the largest protestant organization in the afj phil are you trying to wreck my career

you realize I am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones it was in that abraham wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house on dogtown common a desolate place even then
red and handley god help them knew the old dogtown lore and I knew they knew it for id told them a lot of it it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows
yes gentlemen I am getting to the point to my point you know the facts they are set forth in your own newspapers
so what I am trying to tell you is the why that is my point and that concerns the spirit of the matter there is an inwardness and a luster to old furniture look at that mahogany highboy behind you which has a provocative emanation if I may say so
just think of old granther stannard who pulled the teeth of dark younger her real name was dorcas and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass after that he was never known to run or even walk fast
please get that in your reports it accounts for so many things

golly rod exclaimed to harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators dont that fiddle make you wish the bible didnt say us baptists cant dance nor methodists neither she replied not that it matters to me being this far along
with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her boneweary legs and worried about all that might have happened to sally she was deeply thankful that she could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle skipping and singing farmer in the dell farmer in the dell heighho the dairyoh the farmer in the dell
rod and dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins shucks gran they said almost in unison

yes though not professional musicians they were a musicloving family in his native cologne where his mother taught him to play the piano he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet
by observing the conductor he says with a twinkle in his eyes I learned how not to conduct the musician ran away from school when he was fifteen but this escapade did not save him from the gymnasium
this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post yes the maestro assented
he always wished to be a conductor no originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such
other world premieres will be gardner reads third symphony and burle marxs samba concertante next year we will do also a ford commission a piano concerto by elliott carter with jacob lateiner as soloist
my pittsburghers have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour especially mahlers first and fourth symphonies and das lied von der erde and bruckners sixth which is rarely played and seventh
now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us I am probably the only one with the possible exception of leonard bernstein who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner and mahler since he introduces so much modern music I could not resist asking how he felt about it
as my wife puts it he said again with a twinkle in his eyes all you know is your music after all you never learned anything else
he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature his prime interest apart from music he insisted seriously was his family his wife daughter and son
it is easy for you to talk countered a twenty year old law student you travel around the world we would like to do that too
what they wished for most was security what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country the ideal home they agreed would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms just enough for a family consisting of husband wife and two children
then and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent and even indecent group from greenwich village to the embarcadero he had become a suckerrolling freightjumper
there aint nothin faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball freight when you na go someplace feathertop would say the accommodations may not be the poshest but man there aint nobody askin for your ticket stub neither
he was as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own riding the dark train out out and out and never to return again one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped
she pulled her legs up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and feathertops music pfffted away now that is a very nice a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner a little thing but the right twist for the action that counted hot that was the word hot hair like a morningfrightened sparrows wings with the sun shining down over them a poet yet
his thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however zinggggo then the boy straightarmed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting
he was less to see but feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight curly hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummers blocky hands and a body that said well maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes but then im finished we made it cappy the chick said

I selfserved when they had licked the last of the wieners taste from their fingers they settled back and cappy offered ernie a cigarette nice kid ernie thought too bad
cappys head came around sharply your fault hell it was all my fault cappy raged at himself oh he was stupid her old man

a drink ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket yeah now that you offer the answer came from the open door of the boxcar from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade
he belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door well now he said and reached into his pocket

ernie was screaming inside himself no damn you you aint gon na take my meal ticket away from me the newcomer stalked toward them and kitty shied back her hand to her mouth
the kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back the fist went down into the pile of flesh and ernie heard the bigger mans deeper voice go aaawww
early in january he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans and upon learning of gorhams intention henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs he contended but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless negroes
I considered that your views would be best carried out he explained by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of emancipation I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience & justice
two of these were included in palfreys lot giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves all more than fifty years old with the st martins parish police jury
nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty the present issue in atlantica whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens resembles the american one of rather than the one that was resolved by civil war
this right of the state its upholders contended was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the union government the champions of the union maintained that the constitution had formed fundamentally the united people of america that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states and that therefore the states had no right to secede though the citizens could
oh well you cant really blame lolotte she lost her beau to you
I dont want it sarah said firmly oh well ill take it down with me as I go
now wait a minute she told herself think about it lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee she had lost a bottle of opium but that was on the trip from new orleans
someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa yes she had missed it after her talk with emile after dinner just before emile was shot
he didnt even know that she was there and he certainly couldnt have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding yes and credible fool he had every right to expect
no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised then somebody else dont question rev had said dont invite danger
added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she wouldnt have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by its taste no it was merely an attempt to frighten her
she wouldnt go back to new york as maude suggested she wouldnt run like a scared cat well shed be very careful

this is the story of his last tragic voyage as nearly as we are able or ever probably will be able to determine the sailing in the spring of was hudsons fourth in four years each time his objective had been the same a direct water passage from western europe to the far east
his chief discovery was important the great north later the hudson river but it produced no northwest passage when the half moon put in at dartmouth england in the fall of word of hudsons findings leaked out and english interest in him revived
he named this opening between baffin island and labrador the furious overfall later it was to be called hudson strait in george waymouth in the same little discovery that hudson now commanded had sailed miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back
worse his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before of only one could he be sure young john hudson his second son
it is believed that hudson was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was trained on company ships he was a londoner married with three sons the common misconception that he was dutch and that his first name was hendrik stem from dutch documents of his third voyage
early in june the discovery passed desolation southern greenland and in midjune entered the furious overfall floating ice bore down from the north and west
a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther instead of quelling the dissension as many captains of the era would have done sir francis drake lopped a mans head off under similar circumstances hudson decided to be reasonable
hudson named the capes digges and wolstenholme for two of his backers hudson pointed the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea now called hudson bay confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the pacific
on the eve of his return to their native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection the supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled says the wife her husband has achieved immortality
most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue already seen illusion just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences in this manner they sidestep the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually
the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself one day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone clasping him by the arm whispered I want a word with you please

now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object of his pride why he went on when rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip I didnt think twice about it
ive helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brothers tackle shop hell I gave him the first decent job he ever had six seven how many years ago was it rob
he was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the german who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley hi there schaffner he had said
I make you one no thank you very much schaffner had answered in his accented english I like that kid I agree yes
if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country is that right well no herr schaffner said
thats what he told me why thats his main reason for making the dive

there was no definite agreement about business arrangements well damn waddell said
I know this from my talks with him well lets let him make up his own mind ok waddell said on the basis of the facts
all tourists come to florida this will help him to get out of his little tackle shop yes there is no use causing him to worry at this time the germans words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty

you came straight up from without a stop artie said well I was a little bit confused
he looked at his son his face worried scotty murmured no thanks so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him
his hands lay loosely yet stiffly they were like wax hands almost lifelike not quite folded in his lap his mouth hung slightly open when he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable he would answer if as often happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or impatience only a little louder
they turned at the bottom of kates steps and moved off in the direction of the park he thought he saw it awakened and for a moment interested him that elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash
I imagine youre always battling in school I dont go to school any more pardon
the doctor had to bend close to hear his delicate hand as veined as a moths wing rested absently on scottys chest scotty said the same words more loudly oh
well were taking a little vacation thats all he turned unsmilingly to rachel
she turned to him again well mrs charles sally has phoned too
well theres time in any case well wait till youre stronger and then talk about it
she put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed scotty said okay
it is characteristic of him we are told his little artifice to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art this occurs now at the refrain of jacobys song at the point in fact of the name lizzy a modulation described as almost a stroke of genius
by the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience he collapses and dies in the work of every artist I suppose there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive ultimately emblematic of what it is all about not less strikingly so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image a single moment so here
finally the theatrical and perversely erotic notions of dressing up cosmetics disguise and especially change of costume or singularity of costume as with cipolla are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of manns stories we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates
for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together in prophetic parody professionally a lawyer that is to say associated with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially middleclass he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up disguised that is paradoxically revealed as a child and worse as a whore masquerading as a child
that this abandonment takes place on a stage during an artistic performance is enough to associate jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the punishment for art that is he is suspect guilty punishable as is anyone in manns stories who produces illusion and this is true even though the constant elements of the artistnature technique magic guilt and suffering are divided in this story between jacoby and lautner it appears that the dominant tendency of manns early tales however pictorial or even picturesque the surface is already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic
the first sentence with its platitudinous irony announces an emblematic intent the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad ran beside it all the way to the end that is to say to the churchyard the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction
the highroad one might say at first belongs to life while the way to the churchyard belongs to death that is too simple and wont hold up
his rage assumes a religious form that is on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecates doom on life not only the cyclist now but the audience the world as well all you lightheaded breed this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal
it was dark and I sensed very large only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness
I felt certain he was really a spineless little man his hat the cause of his baldness hung on a hook on the wall and underneath it I could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck
in the mornings I was informed fluorescent tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall they and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office
he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words I was shown instead a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning
now here was something of obvious importance to me yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand he couldnt afford to have anyone mess around with them he said
it was I felt possible that they were men who having received no tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below
also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder no sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention
when I asked him what if anything I could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall I could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before ten oclock
he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there indeed my scholastic qualifications were such that he a college graduate himself must envy me them I sure he asked that I knew what I was applying for
though I doubted that he would understand me I told the director my motives for applying I had always I said hankered after working hard with my hands
this desire I went on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing to this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence
when he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh miss langford her first name was evelyn was an attractive girl
tall blonde blueeyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh starched summer dress something was beginning to stir and come alive in her too it may have been there for a good while since she was twenty now but if it had been it had been smothered until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older bigger boys like jack
the first two or three days they went home early all that is except jack he hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened desks and put the room in order
once this was on the third day of school she kneeled down to pick up some books where theyd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating
about that time miss langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although probably she didnt even see him he jumped back ducked and ran crouching down the hill away from the school
that night he dreamed a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the teacher did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire he ate litle that morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate heartily
no im not hungry he said pushing back the bacon and eggs outside it was already hot at am and it was getting hot in the kitchen
ok I wont play hard he promised just then charles lever yelled hey jack from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door yelling goodbye mom over his shoulder
jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were charles only apparent interest but jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from charles revelations even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention so he usually invited them as he did now no what
his heart beat faster hell you say he said lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles howd you do it hell I jist got on top of
no I mean howd you get her to do it hell I jist ask her jist like that hell yes
oh come on miss langford play with us just onct one of the little girls begged smiling wistfully no not now said the teacher maybe at dinner time
when she appeared two or three of the little girls jumped up and down yelling goody goody lets play withem jack said rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants ok
then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over her head while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again jack ran over offered her his hand and said gosh im sorry miss langford
oh shucks the girl said I dont believe ill play any more neither
that should do it he thought because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he couldnt take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand facetowall in a corner instead of stay in after school
to his surprise his plan worked perfectly all right if you cant do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out miss langford said firmly not smiling
the principal defender of this view of primary experience as causal efficacy is alfred north whitehead our most elemental and unavoidable impressions he says are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future
that is why the argument runs the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction

carried high on this charge he composes magical poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words if he thus achieves a lyrical dreamlike drugged intensity he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work allen ginsbergs howl is a striking example of this tendency that is disoriented dionysian but without depth and without apollonian control

you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant killpath peered through halfclosed lids at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and aboutfaced
finally orville intoned through his hawk nose we cant have people running in any time they please sergeant no sir running in running out
killpath said you were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago sergeant thats not getting all the juice out of the orange now is it no sir

he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk I might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped
he stared at the report in killpaths hand sure it was written by accacia just as sure as if hed submitted it in his scrawled longhand he sucked in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet again wound the goldwire stems of his glasses around his ears and then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned acting lieutenant gunnar matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the stations activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the homicide detail of the inspectors bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander acting captain ot killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as afterhours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six he leaned back and peeled off his glasses failed to cooperate with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordere

patrolman accacia is an alert and conscientious lawenforcement officer I dont think his diligence mitigates your negligence matson negligence hell
he interrupted himself looking around gun at the doorway morning lieutenant rinker sorry orville I thought you hadnt come in yet
