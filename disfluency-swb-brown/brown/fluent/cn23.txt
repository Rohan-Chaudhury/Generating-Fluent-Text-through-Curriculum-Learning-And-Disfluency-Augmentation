Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head -- caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute. <SEP> The body continued to lash but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome bloody mass out of the bungalow. He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots. <SEP> He heard their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes. It was only then that he turned to look at Penny. <SEP> She was sitting on the edge of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found her. The fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth. <SEP> Her hands were calm now. Shes got guts thought Keith. <SEP> Shes got more guts than any other woman in the world. Keith Keith you were wonderful. <SEP> I dont suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life but I am. Thank you Keith. <SEP> He smiled at her sincerity. For the hundredth time that week he was startled at her beauty. Strange. <SEP> Seven years theyd been married. He knew her mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part. <SEP> Her beauty always surprised him anew. I realize that this is hardly the time to say it Penny said Keith. <SEP> Knowing you I know that youre glad to be alive and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake even though I had to. That so <SEP> Penny lowered her eyes. Yes she said almost in a whisper as if admitting to a crime. <SEP> The snake was beautiful wasnt it Asked Keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself as he struggled to control his growing anger. It was a king cobra the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle didnt it <SEP> it Penny did not answer. <SEP> Now she just sat there looking at him without an expression except concern for him. Were all Gods creatures arent we <SEP> Keith was snarling now. All of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle. You love this village and these stinking brown people because theyre Gods creatures too. <SEP> You love Ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even a little more because hes a beautiful man. He loves you because youre a beautiful woman. <SEP> Were all Gods creatures arent we Penny All of us except me. You hate me you hate my guts because I like to hunt. <SEP> You actually hate me because I killed that filthy snake. Why dont you say something <SEP> Penny would not rise to his mood. There isnt anything left to say is there Keith <SEP> She softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader. He knew she was not sulking not even angry at him. <SEP> Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him. The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet. <SEP> For a brief period each year the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam past the Khasi Hills and into Bengal past Sirinjani and Madaripur until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal. Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space. <SEP> Keith looked down more than up. He thought of the jungles below him and of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals the lords. <SEP> At first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war. After the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself. <SEP> Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves. Keiths record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically who might even survive. <SEP> He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates. The RAF was Britains weapon of attrition and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war. <SEP> He knew how to shoot down Nazis. He knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else because he was chemically incapable of fear. <SEP> That was true but only half the truth. The other half he didnt like to recognize even to himself. <SEP> He enjoyed the killing. Not defending England or being an ace or fighting for humanity. He enjoyed killing. <SEP> He would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi. Nowadays we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish. <SEP> The Nazis bombed Britain so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down. Not quite. It was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis who were better organized and technically superior. <SEP> It took a long time before the British tipped the balance. Keith learned too much about air combat and air killing to be risked. <SEP> They grounded him and put him in the Command offices. That was where he met Penny. <SEP> He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work in the Command offices but that was all. Penny knew him better on her part. <SEP> He had a war reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals. They dont go for bull-like muscle as a rule. <SEP> He had strength in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier. He was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep. <SEP> His hair was black already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only one permitted to a man. The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles -- and Penny hating the cliche had to admit that in this case it applied. <SEP> Keith was an eagle. Penny and Keith had no romance. No dates or hand-holding. <SEP> They met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly. The Command offices were in the border country up north where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy. <SEP> The Nazis knew this of course and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit. This time they had been lucky. <SEP> The Command post was underground and well camouflaged. There hadnt been enough time to build it for keeps. <SEP> There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a direct hit comes along. This one was actually more of a near miss. <SEP> The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post but not precisely into the Command room itself. There was a shattering cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust and flying debris and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered. That is everyone but Keith and Penny. <SEP> They stood there just the two of them in the rocking shattering blast. Keith was on his feet because he didnt care at all about life any more : Penny on her feet proudly because she cared too much. <SEP> The bomb was a solitary one. The blast damaged but did not destroy the room. <SEP> Keiths eyes met Pennys as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction. As the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his. <SEP> The chaplain married them on the next day. After the war Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her. <SEP> She came from Ohio from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers. To Keiths London-bred mind such acreage sounded rather invincible. <SEP> It wasnt that however which decided them not to go to America. Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma. <SEP> He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains and the jungles. He didnt tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself. <SEP> He couldnt stop killing. That was his true love not Penny. <SEP> The terrible power of a gun the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never wanted to lose. In the hunting land this hunger was considered to be a noble thing. <SEP> When they got to Shillong in Assam he was happy. This is a paradise for hunters. <SEP> This was the land of the sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread. The great black leopards. The sambur buck the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk. He even hunted elephant although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin. <SEP> There are big rogues in both countries. These were the ones Keith sought out -- the loners the ones who killed for the joy of it like himself. <SEP> He and Penny would go out on tame elephants raised from babyhood in the keddah. While he was ever alert for game and most particularly a tiger Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing. <SEP> They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools. Peacocks strutted across their path preening. <SEP> There were fantastic flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song. Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close. <SEP> Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes and grunted derision when they didnt consider such game worthy of a shot from the.
