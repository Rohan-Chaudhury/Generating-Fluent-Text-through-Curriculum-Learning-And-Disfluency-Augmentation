The expense and time involved are astronomical. <SEP> However we sent a third vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two. We have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago that is all I can tell you about them. <SEP> The third ship came back several years ago and reported That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings Said Hal forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak. <SEP> Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes. How did you know He said sharply. <SEP> Forgive me Sandalphon said Hal. It was inevitable <SEP> the Forerunner predict in his Time and the World Line that such a planet would be found I believe it was on page <SEP> Macneff smiled and said I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression. How could they not Thought Hal. <SEP> Besides they were not the only impressions. I still bear scars on my back where Pornsen my gapt whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough. <SEP> He was a good impresser that Pornsen. Was Is As I grew older and was promoted so was he always where I was. <SEP> He was my gapt in the creche. He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him. <SEP> He is now my block gapt. He is the one responsible for my getting such low M. R. s. <SEP> Swiftly came the revulsion the protest. Not he for I and I alone am responsible for whatever happens to me. If I get a low M.R. I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does. <SEP> If I die I die because I willed it so. So forgive me Sigmen for the contrary-to-reality thoughts <SEP> pardon me again Sandalphon said Hal. The expedition find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet Perhaps even though this is too much to wish find the Forerunner himself <SEP> No said Macneff. That does not mean that there may not be such records there. <SEP> The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth. I cant tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere. <SEP> If you volunteer you will be told where youre going after the ship leaves. It leaves very soon. <SEP> You need a linguist Said Hal. The ship is huge but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one. <SEP> We have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion. Unfortunately Hal waited : Macneff paced some more frowning. <SEP> Then he said Unfortunately only one lamechian linguist exists and he is too old for this expedition. Therefore A thousand pardons said Hal. <SEP> I have just thought of one thing. I am married. <SEP> No problem at all said Macneff. There will be no women aboard the Gabriel. <SEP> If a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce. Hal gasped and he said A divorce <SEP> Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said You are horrified of course. From our reading of the Western Talmud we Urielites believe that the Forerunner knowing this situation would arise made reference to and provision for divorce. <SEP> Its inevitable in this case for the couple will be separated for at the least forty years. Naturally he couched the provision in obscure language. <SEP> In his great and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the Israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned. I volunteer said Hal. <SEP> Tell me more Sandalphon. Six months later Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him. <SEP> It was night on this hemisphere but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia Japan China Southeast Asia India Siberia. Hal the linguist saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein. <SEP> Australia the Philippine Islands Japan and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac Union that spoke American. Southern China all of southeast Asia southern India and Ceylon these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar. <SEP> Siberia spoke Icelandic. His mind turned the globe swiftly for him and he visualized Africa which used Swahili south of the Sahara Sea. <SEP> All around the Mediterranean Sea Asia Minor northern India and Tibet Hebrew was the native tongue. In southern Europe between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic-speaking peoples of northern Europe was a thin but long stretch of territory called March. <SEP> This was no mans land disputed by the Haijac Union and the Israeli Republic a potential source of war for the last two hundred years. Neither nation would give up their claim on it yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War. <SEP> For all practical purposes it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government -LRB- unrecognized outside its own borders -RRB-. Its citizens spoke all of the worlds surviving tongues plus a new one called Lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper. <SEP> Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland Greenland the Caribbean Islands and the eastern half of South America. Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian-Americans who were busy resettling North America and the western half of South America after the Apocalyptic War. <SEP> Then there was North America where American was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson Bay Preserve. Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone Sigmen City would blaze out into space. <SEP> Somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment. Mary would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti. <SEP> She would weep in private he was sure for she loved him in her frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed. Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically. <SEP> If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash he must have wanted it that way. There was no such thing as an accident. <SEP> Somehow all the other passengers -LRB- also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel -RRB- had simultaneously agreed to die. Therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony. <SEP> The fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared. Hal felt sorry for Mary he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome. <SEP> This was the best way. He and Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other their mutual torture would be over. <SEP> Mary was free to marry again not knowing that the Sturch had secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her marriage. She would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt. <SEP> Perhaps the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hals child would no longer be present. Perhaps. Hal doubted if this happy event would occur. <SEP> Mary was as frozen below the navel as he. No matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt The gapt. Pornsen. He would no longer have to see that fat face hear that whining voice <SEP> Hal Yarrow Said the whining voice. Slowly feeling himself icy yet burning Hal turned. <SEP> There was the squat loose-jowled man smiling lopsidedly up at him. My beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the whining voice. <SEP> I had no idea that you too would be on this glorious voyage. I might have known <SEP> We seem to be bound by love Sigmen himself must have foreseen it. Love to you my ward. Sigmen love you too my guardian said Hal choking. How wonderful to see your cherished self. <SEP> I had thought we would never again speak to each other. The Gabriel pointed towards her destination and under one-gee acceleration began to build up towards her ultimate velocity. Percent of the speed of light. <SEP> Meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship went into the suspensor. Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years. <SEP> Some time later after a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join the others. They would sleep while the Gabriels drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured. <SEP> Upon reaching the desired speed the automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journeys end. Many years later the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration. <SEP> Again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied. Then after slowing the vessel considerably the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration. <SEP> The crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation. These members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel. <SEP> In the half-year left before reaching their destination the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed. Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out. <SEP> He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen Siddo. From the first he faced a difficult task. <SEP> The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words. The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted. And as Hal found out obviously mistaken in many cases. <SEP> This discovery caused Hal anxiety. His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen. <SEP> If he used all of the little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students wrongly. Moreover even getting this across would be difficult. <SEP> For one thing the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmens the sounds made by these organs were therefore dissimilar. It was true that they could be approximated but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations <SEP> Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo. Consider the tense system. <SEP> Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future Siddo used an entirely different word. Thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigaluahai meaning to live was in the perfect tense ksuupeliafo and in the future maiteipa. <SEP> The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses. Plus the fact that Siddo not only had the normal three genders of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual. Fortunately gender was inflected though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo. <SEP> The system of indicating gender varied according to tense. All the other parts of speech : nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs.
