Well -- said Mr. Skyros. <SEP> I take a little time to think it over. It was awkward : very awkward. <SEP> There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over. Someone reasonably trustworthy. Angie would hear about it. <SEP> Angie knew -- Time said Angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros. Not too much time because Ill be needing some more myself pretty much right away. <SEP> I done favors for you big favor not so long back didnt I and Im right here to take on where Pretty left off. No trouble. I dont want no trouble you dont want no trouble nobody wants trouble Mr. Skyros. <SEP> Dear heaven thought Mr. Skyros turning away as another man came in. He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand the genial smile seemed painted on his face. <SEP> Angie knew -- Speak of dangerous information <SEP> Angie knew too much entirely already. Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay Big favor I done you. <SEP> Acourse theres this deal o Dennys -- and Jackies -- kinda hangin fire aint it maybe youve been kinda worryin over that. And cant say I blame you said Angie thoughtfully. This deal with the ace o spades. Anything to do with an ace o spades bad luck. <SEP> Ace of spades -- a widow that was what they called a widow these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros distractedly. All about that Angie knew too. <SEP> When things got a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand -- it seemed to be a general rule. All just by chance and in a way tracing back to poor Frank all of it because naturally -- brothers living together -- and Angie -- Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelos regular-featured almost girlishly good-looking face -- or indeed anything about Angelo. Mr. Skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles he found money much more interesting but all the same he thought now uneasily of the way in which Angelo earned his living -- and paid for his own stuff -- and eyed the soft smile and the spaniel-like dark eyes and he felt a little ill. <SEP> Look my friend in my life I learn better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure. I stay in business so long because Im careful. <SEP> Two weeks a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that then we make a little deal isnt it Thats a long while said Angie. <SEP> I tell you you want to leave it that way I dont fool around with it. I go over to Castro and get fixed up there. <SEP> I cant wait no two weeks. And Mr. Skyros didnt like Angie but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely to come out All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys -- Why did everything have to happen at once Denny said stupidly you aint turning Angie down are you Mr. Skyros <SEP> we all figured Angie -- Angelo gave him an affectionate smile. <SEP> Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me he said. Its O.K. Denny everythings O.K. Aint it Mr. Skyros <SEP> the name repeated over and over anybody to hear -- Not being a fool Mr. Skyros knew why. Aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held the whip hand. And all because of Domokous <SEP> Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause -- Of course there was another factor. <SEP> Angie worth his weight in gold right now but these users they sometimes went down fast. Who knew Angie might not last long. <SEP> The sweat broke out on Mr. Skyros forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking -- hoping -- planning -- perhaps -- above had not Domokous been enough He patted Angelos thin shoulder paternally. <SEP> You dont want to go talking that way he said. Youre the one take over for Pretty soon as I get the supply get started up again isnt it <SEP> You dont need worry Angelo. I tell you I know how it is with you my friend I sympathize and Ill make it a special point -- a special favor -- get in touch and get some stuff just for you. <SEP> I dont know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow but Ill try my best my friend. You see you got to remember we all got schedules like any business <SEP> My man he wont be around a little while he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the Elite. Its awkward isnt it <SEP> thats your business Mr. Skyros said Angie and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window. I appreciate it you do that. <SEP> We dont none of us want no trouble. Im in a room over the Golden Club on San Pedro you just ask for me there you want see me. <SEP> Maybe I call you -- tonight About nine oclock I call and see if you got any. A couple decks for me Mr. Skyros -- and ten-twelve to sell see I like to have a little ready cash. <SEP> I dont know about that much said Mr. Skyros. Pretty he always keeps it a strict cash basis like they say -- <SEP> Sure said Angie. Mr. Skyros. Fifty a throw that the deal I bring you the cash five hundred for ten decks. <SEP> Never mind how much I cut it how much I get and he smiled his sleepy smile again. Standard deal Mr. Skyros. You gon have a look round for it. <SEP> I do my best just for you my friend. This is awkward for everybody isnt it we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes. <SEP> I do my best for you. He got out of there in a hurry brushing past another man in the door mopping his brow. The expedient thing -- very true one must make do as one could in some situations. <SEP> It could all be straightened out later. Not very much later but when things had settled down a little. This deal with the Bouvardier woman went through. An ace of spades. <SEP> He was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that indeed. He rather wished he had never got into the business and still -- scarcely to be resisted a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money <SEP> Katya Roslev who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change. She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks. <SEP> Usually she marked the few who did thank you you didnt get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself seeing how downright rude she could act to the others before theyd take offense threaten to call the manager. Funny how seldom they did : used to it probably. The kind who came into a cheap store like this <SEP> Grab snatch I saw that first Here Ill take this I was before her you wait on me now or I dont bother with it <SEP> This kind of place Shed be through here just no time at all -- leave this kind of thingway behind. Off at noon and shed never come back. <SEP> Never have to. Money -- a lot of money enough. Shed be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills sos nobody would suspect -- maybe couldnt get it until Monday account of that the banks -- But that wasnt really long to wait. Not when shed waited so long already. No need say anything at all to the old woman. <SEP> She had it all planned out how shed do. Shed say she didnt feel good on Sunday couldnt go to church and when the old woman had gone quick pack the things shed need to take all but the dress shed wear Monday and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight for a dime. <SEP> Then on Monday morning get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money in an envelope under the old womans purse there in the drawer. She wouldnt be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left go do the daily shopping. No need leave a note with it either -- or maybe just something like Dont worry about me Im going away to make a better life. A better life. Escape. <SEP> It wasnt as if she wanted much. She didnt mind working hard not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft -- all she wanted was a chance where she wasnt marked as what she was. <SEP> To be Katharine Ross and work in a nicer shop somewhere at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes and learn ladies manners and all like that and get to know different people than up to now not just the ones like her here with foreign-sounding names the ones went to the same church and -- Different place different job different people shed be all different too. Prettier shed do her hair another way smarter and wear different kinds of clothes -- shed be Katharine Ross just what that sounded like. <SEP> Youve give me the wrong change said the customer sharply. Think I cant count <SEP> Katya made up the amount in indifferent silence. She was listening to other voices out of the future. Some of those vaguely-imagined new different people. Katharines awfully nice and pretty too I like Katharine -- Lets ask Katharine to go with us shes always lots of fun -- Katharine -- Soon very soon now sixteen <SEP> Mendoza didnt wake until nearly nine-thirty. It was going to be another hot day already the thermometer stood close to ninety. <SEP> Alison was still sound asleep he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom which tasted peculiarly of face powder. He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today and drove home. <SEP> After hed got out fresh liver for Bast he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish. Surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle <SEP> He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens. Y que sigue despues -- What then He asked her severely. <SEP> A lot of people are so peculiar that they dont like cats its not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens -- and damn it you know very well if I have them around long impossible to give them away And I suppose now that youve finally grown up if a little late youd go on producing kittens every six months or so. <SEP> Its a pity to spoil your girlish figure -- which all those kittens would do anyway -- but I think when youve raised these well just have the vet fix it so there wont be any more. I wonder if the Carters would take one. <SEP> Its no good looking at me like that as she wound affectionately around his ankles.
