For several months now Jack Carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a Woman. <SEP> This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she radiated warmth a sweet warmth she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately. When she would do these things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach. <SEP> Then he would run to the toilet behind the house. Sometimes he did this three or four times a day for this Woman was almost always with him. <SEP> He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him. But they never said anything so he figured it was all right. <SEP> And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the Woman of Jacks mind assumed the teachers face and figure. He could not keep his eyes off her when at school when he went home at night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do. <SEP> When he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh. Miss Langford was an attractive girl. <SEP> Tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh starched summer dress. Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her too : you could tell it by the way she watched the older bigger boys like Jack. <SEP> She would look at Jack with that hidden something in her eyes and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick. School began in August the hottest part of the year and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another. <SEP> The first two or three days they went home early. All except Jack. He hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order. <SEP> Once she kneeled down to pick up some books where theyd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg. He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating. <SEP> About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him although probably she didnt even see him. He jumped back ducked and ran crouching down the hill away from the school. <SEP> He didnt look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath then he slowed to a walk. The vision became even stronger now. <SEP> Ill get her yet he muttered to himself. Ive got to get her. <SEP> That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion in which he and the Woman now the teacher did everything except engage in the act and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire. He ate litle that morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate heartily. <SEP> Whats the matter honey She said with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child. You hungry <SEP> Im not hungry he said pushing back the bacon and eggs. Outside it was already hot at : A.M. And it was getting hot in the kitchen. <SEP> He felt a little sick at his stomach. You sick <SEP> No he said. Ill be all right. <SEP> I guess its this hot weather. You play hard today then. <SEP> If you get sick ask the teacher to let you come home early. Daddy left the car for me and Im going to town this afternoon. <SEP> I wont play hard he promised. Just then Charles Lever yelled Jack from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door yelling Mom over his shoulder. <SEP> Wha dd ya say boy Charles said grinning showing his huge yellow teeth. Charles also fifteen was tall and skinny scraggly with straight black hair like an Indians and sharp brown eyes. <SEP> He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him. You know what I done last night Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school. <SEP> Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were Charles only apparent interest. But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles revelations so he usually invited them as he did now. What <SEP> I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry. A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jacks mind. <SEP> His heart beat faster. you say He said lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles. <SEP> Howd you do it I jist got on top of -- <SEP> I mean howd you get her to do it I jist ask her. Jist like that <SEP> Shes been hangin around me a lot here lately and I figgered I might as wells try it. Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin it. <SEP> I never heard that. Its all over Branchville. <SEP> If youd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself. I might try it one of these days Jack said wonderingly thinking of Miss Langford. <SEP> When they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse. Miss Langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without socks was out there with them trying to get them inside. <SEP> Time for books she yelled jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand. Lets go inside. <SEP> Come on Miss Langford play with us just onct one of the little girls begged smiling wistfully. Not now said the teacher. Maybe at dinner time. <SEP> Come inside now. The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse. <SEP> Jack watched Miss Langford all morning. He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider. <SEP> Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did. At noontime remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys except Charles went off out the road to play ball. <SEP> Why aint you playin ball He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse. Miss Langford come out and play with us like you promised several of the little girls called. <SEP> Id druther stay here and watch the girls Charles grinned. Maybe some ofem will fall down and well see up their dress. <SEP> Maybe Jack said idly watching for Miss Langford. Presently she came out of the schoolhouse. <SEP> When she appeared two or three of the little girls jumped up and down yelling . Lets play withem Jack said rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants. <SEP> Charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join the girls. They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap. <SEP> Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls Jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over her head. While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again Jack ran over offered her his hand and said Im sorry Miss Langford. <SEP> I didnt mean to pull so hard. Thats all right she said tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes. <SEP> It was my fault. With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jacks extended hand with the other. <SEP> When her hand touched his fire went through Jack and he felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet. He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go. <SEP> Thank you she said dusting herself off. Will you play with us again Miss Langford One of the little girls said. No more today. Maybe some other day. <SEP> the girl said. I dont believe Ill play any more neither. <SEP> Me neither others said and soon the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups and alone. Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun past Robert Allens three-room tarpapered house toward the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes. <SEP> When he came back to the schoolhouse his mind was made up. He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class. <SEP> That should do it because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work. He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he couldnt take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school. <SEP> The only drawback now to the plan hed decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack. But Ive got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately. <SEP> To his surprise his plan worked perfectly. If you cant do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out Miss Langford said firmly not smiling. <SEP> You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems. And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home. <SEP> He scarcely saw them. His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child How will I do it
