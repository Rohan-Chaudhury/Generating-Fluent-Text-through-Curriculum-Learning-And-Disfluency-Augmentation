Cady didnt come unglued easily but this had not been a day of glad tidings. Tax worries production worries personnel worries and the letter from Hanford College his own alma mater a real snapper. <SEP> Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago. The boys credentials were in order -- scholastic transcript character references picture health record successful college boards. <SEP> Due to the many applicants on file would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his sons motivation interests and his qualifications for leadership Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort. <SEP> This was it. This was the letter which would or would not enroll his son David in Hanford. His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life. His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor lawyer merchant or chief. <SEP> He wondered if he had played it wrong. Maybe he should have kept in touch. Gone back for reunions. <SEP> He had been busy building a business being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford Class of. Besides Cady Partlow knew he wasnt the old-grad-type. <SEP> It wouldnt help anyway. Look at Pete Alcorn who hadnt missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years. <SEP> Petes son was rejected. Hanford College Little Ivy League had no room for football players with low grades. <SEP> Cady looked at his own sons scholastic record with pride. Good solid B average with a sprinkling of As in math and science. Imagine his son being that good in science <SEP> Mr. Partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford. Then he hadnt studied very hard. <SEP> Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking. He put down his pipe and started to type. <SEP> In response to your letter I can in good conscience recommend my son David in the field of leadership. He stopped and looked at the picture of his son the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College. <SEP> He didnt have to be told his son looked like him. David had the same gray eyes high cheekbones dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness. Height. Weight. Health excellent. <SEP> He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence. His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics tennis and swimming. <SEP> His chief motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to -- Mr. Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard ruining the letter. He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build. <SEP> How do you tell a college president that your son doesnt know what he wants to do you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer -- or a lawyer or an editor <SEP> How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential that he will find himself Just give him time give him a chance. <SEP> Cady snapped the Venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter rolled in a fresh sheet and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head. What a production to make of a letter commending your own son <SEP> His eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic. He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics. <SEP> He told Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities. He belonged to a social club a civic group little theater swimming team and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club. <SEP> He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter. There that did it. Then he met the grave eyes of his wife Anne from the photograph next to Davids. <SEP> He shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket. Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything. After all his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products. <SEP> Anne had a way with words. Half of it was natural half was Smith College. <SEP> The whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college. A woman had it or she didnt. <SEP> Anne had it. She said what she meant and let it be. <SEP> She never got on his back. He could take the advice or leave it. <SEP> He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator. You look like you just heard a real gasser Mr. Partlow. <SEP> Cady looked at Tom who had taken him up and down for fifteen years. I was just thinking how things have changed. <SEP> When I went to college they begged you to come. Be our guest <SEP> Its our pleasure Now you have to be well rounded firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge <SEP> Tom slid open the door to the lobby. Thats a fact Mr. Partlow. <SEP> My John applied to six colleges before he got in. Going to State <SEP> Hes president of the rocket club here you know. Always messing around with science stuff. Real bright along those lines you might say. He got a science scholarship to Yale. <SEP> thats fine Tom. Just fine. As he drove home through the thinning traffic Cady felt the unease growing. <SEP> He hadnt told anyone but he too had applied to five colleges for David. They had all turned down his son. Weakness in leadership. So sorry. Limited interests. So sorry. No clear motivation. So sorry. <SEP> He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini Anne had waiting for him. But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket. <SEP> Looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did. He liked looking at Anne. <SEP> Most people did. He liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose. <SEP> From those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did. She always could sense the shag end of a woolly day. Board meeting tonight Cady <SEP> I begged off. Work to do. I have the car Dad <SEP> Why not let him take it Cady I know it is midweek but its only eight days before commencement. <SEP> Lets forget the rules. Cady deep in thought neither heard nor answered. <SEP> David grinned. Carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly Mr. Chairman <SEP> Cady Partlows head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse. Im sorry Dave. The car <SEP> Of course you can have it. Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else slowly methodically and with interest. <SEP> Hear anything from Hanford yet Dad Cady begged the question. <SEP> Dont worry about it Dave. Your acceptance will come through. <SEP> Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys. Dont be too sure Dad. <SEP> Charles Burke got turned down by Dartmouth and he is a straight-A student. Anne said it wasnt surprising because Charles was antisocial a lone wolf and completely one-sided. <SEP> I can hardly say the same about you Dave Dave kissed her lightly. <SEP> Girls my dear parent are here to stay Get my old man to bed early. <SEP> He looks a little bit frayed. Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot. <SEP> Lets go into the library. You do seem somewhat tattered. <SEP> Cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room. I didnt know I looked so dilapidated Wrong word darling. <SEP> Your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it. Need any help In a way. <SEP> Hanford College hasnt decided on Daves application yet. They want a letter from me on his motives interests and leadership. <SEP> Heres what I wrote. Cady handed her the letter drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence. <SEP> Already he could feel Annes questioning eyes. I know you wrote this in a hurry but Cady Dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days. <SEP> That was when half the school was down with flu. He was president. <SEP> He wasnt really elected treasurer of the science club. He just took over the week Bill Daley was in the state basketball play-off. <SEP> Cady stuck his jaw out. The fact remains he was treasurer. And the swimming team. <SEP> Cady he made second team. Just missed the first. A team is a team insisted Cady. Anything else <SEP> Yes she said quietly. I dont think youve been quite honest Cady. <SEP> It isnt like you. Davids interests. Astronomy. He was mad about stars at the age of nine. Geology You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago <SEP> Those arent his interests now. What do you suggest <SEP> Just say he likes swimming tennis chess and music. Music He hasnt been to a symphony concert all season. <SEP> Anne smiled. He plays bass with Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts <SEP> You mean that rock-and-roll combo Even in that he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax. <SEP> -- hes just there thats all. Hes just there. <SEP> He keeps the beat going. He likes to play bass because he doesnt have to solo. <SEP> He doesnt like to rise and shine. Dont worry Cady hell be back in the Beethoven fold by next year. <SEP> Cady appeared slightly mollified. All right. I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts. <SEP> Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck. Maybe I am padding it a bit Anne he said. <SEP> You know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college. He has to have leadership as well as grades. <SEP> Anne folded the worrisome document. You know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend <SEP> He hasnt used it now for several years. You really say his motivation for college is electronics <SEP> Cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel. What would you say he wants to do Just what <SEP> Its Dave who is applying to Hanford College. Why dont you ask him <SEP> For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back. I have talked to him but you know Ive never tried to push him into any profession. <SEP> I wont be guilty of trying to run his life. Anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild. <SEP> Just because your father tried to make a banker out of you youve leaned over backward to keep your hands off. Subconsciously youve wanted him to conform to your mold. <SEP> You want him to be a leader of men like you. Cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder. <SEP> Dave has qualities of leadership. He just hasnt developed them yet. <SEP> Give him time. He never will Cady. Not the kind of leadership you mean working with lots of people. <SEP> All your wishful thinking wont change that. Remember what you used to say in the Army <SEP> You cant run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private Cady walked the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne.
