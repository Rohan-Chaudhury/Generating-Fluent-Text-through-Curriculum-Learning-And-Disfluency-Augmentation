Since then and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper. <SEP> There aint nothin faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wan- na go someplace Feathertop would say. The accommodations may not be the poshest but. There aint nobody askin for your ticket stub neither. <SEP> He had been conning the freights for a long long time now. Ever since the hooch and the trouble with the Quartet and Midge and the child. Ever since all that. It had been a very long time that had no form and no end. <SEP> He was riding the dark train out. Out and out and never to return again. One day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped. <SEP> That was the day it ended. The freight car was cold early in the morning. <SEP> He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina. He held his elbows away from his body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly. <SEP> The train slowed at a road crossing and the big door slid open at first gratingly caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot. The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor. <SEP> She pulled her legs up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and Feathertops music pfffted away. That is a very nice a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner. A little thing but the right twist for the action that counted. Hot that was the word hot Hair like a morning-frightened sparrows wings with the sun shining down over them. A poet yet <SEP> His thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however. Then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting. <SEP> He was less to see but Feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight. Curly hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummers blocky hands and a body that said maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then Im finished. We made it Cappy the chick said. <SEP> Seems so dont it the boy laughed hugging her close. Feathertop interrupted standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants. None of that. <SEP> We run a respectable house here. They whirled and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall. <SEP> He was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes. He held the black plastic kazoo lightly. <SEP> Come sit said Feathertop motioning them toward him. That crap is softer over here. <SEP> The girl smiled and started forward. The boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm. <SEP> Stay with me Kitty he snapped irritably. I vowed to take care of you -- and thats what Im gon na do. <SEP> We dont know this guy. Square bit Feathertop screwed his face up. <SEP> This guy was strictly from Outsville. But nowhere What is with this vow jazz Feathertop inquired lounging against the freights vibrating wall. <SEP> We -- we eloped Cappy said. His head came up and he said it defiantly. <SEP> Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand. These two were going to be easy pickins. <SEP> They couldnt have much dough but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much. Besides the chick had a little something the others didnt have. <SEP> That was gon na be fun collecting But not just yet. Feathertop was a connoisseur. <SEP> He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it. Come sit he repeated motioning to the piled hay bags over the pig leavings. <SEP> Im just a poor ex-jazz man name of -- -- Boyd Smith. He grinned at them wolfishly. <SEP> That aint your name Mister the boy accused. You know -- youre right <SEP> Feathertop aimed a finger at him. Come on Cappy the girl chided. <SEP> Hes okay. Hes a nice guy. <SEP> She started to move toward the hay bags dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her. Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle. <SEP> He cleared his throat it had been a long hot while since hed seen anything as nice as this within grabbin distance. He had it all doped of course. <SEP> Slug the kid grab his dough and then have a rockin ball with the doll. Whered you come from Mr. Mr. Smith Kitty inquired politely. <SEP> Where from He mused. Out. I been riding train for a ways now. <SEP> They lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself. After a while Kitty murmured something to Cappy and he held her close answering Well just have to wait till we pull into Philly honey. <SEP> Whats the matter she wan- na go the bathroom Ernie found it immensely funny. <SEP> The boy scowled at him and the girl looked shocked. Certainly not that isnt what I said She snapped at him. <SEP> I only said I was hungry. We havent had anything to eat all day. <SEP> Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargills voice as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with leather handles. Whynt ya say so fellow travelers <SEP> we got dinner right here. Cmon buddy help me set up the kitchen and well have food in a minute or two. <SEP> Cappy looked wary but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar. Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag. <SEP> He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it. He put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot. <SEP> A charcoal pit he said indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier. Fan it he told Cappy handing him a sheet of newspaper. but whatre we gon na eat Charcoal <SEP> Fella you try my ever-lovin patience. He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners. Hot dogs. Not the greatest but they stick to your belly insides. <SEP> He ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil. Almost immediately they began to sizzle. <SEP> He looked up and grinned. A Krogers self-serve he explained. <SEP> I self-served. When they had licked the last of the wieners taste from their fingers they settled back and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette. Nice kid too bad. <SEP> How come youre riding the rods kids like you Ernie asked. Cappy looked down at his wide hands and did not reply. <SEP> Surprisingly Kittys face came up and she said My father. He didnt want us to get married. <SEP> We ran away. Why didnt he want you to get hitched <SEP> This time even she did not answer. She looked down at her hands too. <SEP> After a few seconds she said Dad didnt like Cappy. It was my fault. <SEP> Cappys head came around sharply. Your fault It was all my fault. <SEP> If Id been careful it never woulda -- he stopped abruptly. Ernies eyebrows went up. <SEP> Whats the matter The girl still did not raise her eyes but she added simply Im pregnant. <SEP> Cappy raged at himself. He was stupid her old man <SEP> You never heard nothin like it : Kittys gon na go have an abortion and Kittys gon na go away to a convent and Kittys this and Kittys that like he was nuts or somethin. Ernie nodded. <SEP> This was a slightly different matter. He remembered Midge and the child. <SEP> That had been a time before all this a time he didnt think about. A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out. These kids werent like him. <SEP> He thought Pull out of it old son. These are just another couple of characters to roll. <SEP> What they got you get. Forget all this other. <SEP> Wann- a drink Ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket. Now that you offer. The answer came from the open door of the boxcar. From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade. <SEP> Ernie stared at the man. He was big. Real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like a grizzly. <SEP> Road gang Ernie thought. You gon na give me a drink fella <SEP> The big man asked again taking a step into the boxcar. Ernie hesitated a moment. <SEP> This character could break him in half. Sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips. <SEP> He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder. The man stalked toward them his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring. <SEP> He took the bottle with undue belligerence and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely. He threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously. <SEP> He belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door. he said and reached into his pocket. <SEP> I didnt know I was gon na have company in this car. Were going to Philadelphia Kitty said pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more. <SEP> I dont think so said the big man and it was the final clincher for Ernie. He had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it. <SEP> Maybe you and me will girlie but these two aint goin nowhere. He advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car. <SEP> Ernie was screaming inside himself : damn you you aint gon na take my meal ticket away from me The newcomer stalked toward them and Kitty shied back her hand to her mouth. <SEP> Her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied by the rattling of the freight and then Cappy came off the floor his legs driving him hard. The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump <SEP> carried him backward in a footballers tackle. They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs. <SEP> The kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back. The fist went down into the pile of flesh and Ernie heard the bigger mans deeper voice go <SEP> Then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade. He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud. <SEP> The blade came out with a snick He fisted the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kids throat. <SEP> Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white. She grabbed at Feathertops sleeve and shrieked Help him <SEP> Help him Do something
