It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Manns work. <SEP> The wife Amra and her lover are both savagely portrayed she as incarnate sensuality voluptuous and indolent possibly a mischief maker with a kind of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity her birdlike brain. Lautner for his part belonged to the present-day race of small artists who do not demand the utmost of themselves and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as wretched little poseurs the devastating indictment they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order and the somewhat extreme prophecy so far not fulfilled : They will be destroyed. <SEP> The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well. His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience it is a spectacle absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation. <SEP> At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacobys upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life. The music which Lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal. <SEP> It is characteristic of him to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art. This occurs now at the refrain of Jacobys song -- at the point in fact of the name Lizzy -- a modulation described as almost a stroke of genius. <SEP> A miracle a revelation it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude. It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and simultaneously his wifes infidelity. <SEP> By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience he collapses and dies. In the work of every artist there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive ultimately emblematic of what it is all about not less strikingly so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image a single moment. So here. <SEP> The horrifying humor the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby the epiphany of that quivering flesh the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent mindless sensuality and sharp shrewd talent cleverness with an occasional touch of genius -LRB- which however does not know how to attack the problem of suffering -RRB- the miraculous way in which music revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art a rather desperate art in itself beyond itself also it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Manns work. When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance I come up with the following ideas which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay. <SEP> Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Manns heroes. The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love. <SEP> The release the freedom involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible and the motion toward it brings disaster. This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art it is particularly the artist -LRB- Tonio Kroger Aschenbach Leverkuhn -RRB- who suffers from it. <SEP> The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the breakthrough in the realm of art. Again the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood with the figure of a child. <SEP> Finally the theatrical -LRB- and perversely erotic -RRB- notions of dressing up cosmetics disguise and especially change of costume are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Manns stories. We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates. <SEP> For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together in prophetic parody. Professionally a lawyer that is to say associated with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially middle-class he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up disguised -- paradoxically revealed -- as a child and worse as a whore masquerading as a child. <SEP> That this abandonment takes place on a stage during an artistic performance is enough to associate Jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the punishment for art he is suspect guilty punishable as is anyone in Manns stories who produces illusion and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature technique magic guilt and suffering are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner. It appears that the dominant tendency of Manns early tales however pictorial or even picturesque the surface is already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic. <SEP> In a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same. Something of this can be learned from The Way To The Churchyard -LRB- -RRB- an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure. <SEP> There is no more plot than that only slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident would give. The artistic interest then lies in what the encounter may be made to represent in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness. <SEP> The first sentence with its platitudinous irony announces an emblematic intent : The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad ran beside it all the way to the end to the churchyard. The action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction. <SEP> The highroad belongs to life while the way to the churchyard belongs to death. That is too simple and wont hold up. <SEP> As the first sentence suggests both roads belong to death in the end. The highroad according to the description of its traffic belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life : a suffering form an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death. <SEP> Thus on the highroad a troop of soldiers marched in their own dust and sang while on the footpath one man walks alone. This mans isolation is not merely momentary it is permanent. <SEP> He is a widower his three children are dead he has no one left on earth also he is a drunk and has lost his job on that account. His name is Praisegod Piepsam and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the authors repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in Death In Venice for example who represent some combination of cadaver exotic and psychopomp. <SEP> This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad. The cyclist a sufficiently commonplace young fellow is not named but identified simply as Life -- that and a license number which Piepsam uses in addressing him. <SEP> Life points out that everybody uses this path and starts to ride on. Piepsam tries to stop him by force receives a push in the chest from Life and is left standing in impotent and growing rage while a crowd begins to gather. <SEP> His rage assumes a religious form on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now but the audience the world as well : all you light-headed breed. This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal. <SEP> Then an ambulance comes along and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away. This is simple enough but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant. <SEP> The season between spring and summer belongs to life in its carefree aspect. Piepsams fatal rage arises not only because he can not stop the cyclist but also because God will not stop him as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : His justice is not of this world. <SEP> Life is further characterized in antithesis to Piepsam as animal : the image of a dog which appears at several places is first given as the criterion of amiable irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is admirable a pleasure to contemplate another wagon has no dog and therefore is devoid of interest. Piepsam calls the cyclist cur and puppy among other things and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face. <SEP> The ambulance is drawn by two charming little horses. Piepsam is not certainly religious in any conventional sense. <SEP> His religiousness is intimately or dialectically connected with his sinfulness the two may in fact be identical. His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home and before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated. <SEP> The cyclist by contrast blond and blue-eyed is simply unreflective unproblematic Life blithe and carefree. He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth. <SEP> Piepsam is grotesque a disturbing parody his end is ridiculous and trivial. He is a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard. <SEP> He is more interesting than the others the ones who come from the highroad to watch him more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist. If I have gone into so much detail about so small a work that is because it is also so typical a work representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Manns writing : the crude sketch of Piepsam contains in its critical destructive and self-destructive tendencies much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of for instance Naphta and Leverkuhn. <SEP> In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for realism anticipates a kind of musical composition as well as a kind of fictional composition in which as Leverkuhn says there shall be nothing unthematic. It resembles too pictures such as Durer and Bruegel did in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary the representation of a proverb for example or a deadly sin. <SEP> Gladius Dei -LRB- -RRB- resembles The Way To The Churchyard in its representation of a conflict between light and dark between Life and a spirit of criticism negation melancholy but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict. The monk Savonarola brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled according to gossip upon the painters mistress. <SEP> Hieronymus like Piepsam makes his protest quite in vain and his rejection though not fatal is ridiculous and humiliating he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter. On the street outside Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence and prophetically he issues his curse : Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter.
