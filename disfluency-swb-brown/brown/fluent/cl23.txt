Thats what the man had said. <SEP> Haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary tear-filled eyes. He had no ready answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing. <SEP> The man drunk or crazy or both his new-found buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count and the mans eyes were still clear. <SEP> The guy is off his rocker Haney thought to himself and looked away from those eyes. Eyes that were clear but also bright with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them. Why hadnt he noticed it before <SEP> the man was not drunk He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger. <SEP> Of course he remembered now. It was blurred after two hours of steady drinking but the occasion of it came back to him. <SEP> The stranger his head seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection. Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have been hit if Phil hadnt called out to him a second before. <SEP> His shout had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking on the spur of the moment. As a matter of fact he wouldnt have cared at all if the guy had been hit. <SEP> Actually he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them. By then the stranger was thanking Haney profusely and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend. <SEP> So the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe-driving record. Then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck drivers face without saying a word. <SEP> Very suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and went back to his truck. Haney hadnt given it much thought at the time. <SEP> Now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off. It must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word. <SEP> When the light went their way they went on across the street. When the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them. <SEP> Phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges. He decided he wouldnt mind company in return for free drinks even though he made good money at his job. <SEP> Phil was like that. Now he wondered if it was worth it having a screwball for company. <SEP> He really didnt take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy. When he finally got the coughing under control he realized that Pete was still waiting for an answer -- he didnt even seem to wink as he continued to stare. <SEP> Haney managed a weak laugh. Guess I cant think of anyone Pete. Thanks anyhow. <SEP> A faint crease appeared between the mans eyebrows. I think you arent taking me seriously Phil. <SEP> I meant it. Everybody has some kind of grudge. <SEP> I might have got hit by that truck if it wasnt for you. I believe in returning favors. <SEP> Ill do anything for somebody I like. It wont cost you a cent Phil. <SEP> Go ahead and try me Phil rubbed his forehead wearily. <SEP> He was beginning to feel woolly. Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit. <SEP> He really didnt expect anything to come of it and there were a few people All right if you must know I dont get along with the landlord. <SEP> He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while Im taking a bath. He says the neighbors complain but I dont believe it. <SEP> Why dont they tell me themselves if it bothers them The man closed his eyes and nodded. <SEP> When he looked up again he seemed almost contented. Fine. Give me your address. <SEP> It will take a little time. I want to study your landlords habits and movements first. <SEP> You see I always make it look like an accident. Maybe suicide if it looks reasonable. In that way theres no trouble for the customer. <SEP> Haneys eyebrows flew up. Customer Pete smiled modestly. <SEP> Its my line of work he said Five minutes later before Haney could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell. <SEP> Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure. Phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for the other glass on the table. <SEP> Some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep. The next day Sunday the hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before. <SEP> The hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he groaned. He went for more aspirin later in the day and passed the surly landlord on the way -- he was still alive and scowling as usual as if tenants were a burden in his life. <SEP> Phil shrugged and ignored him. He went back to work Monday. <SEP> By Wednesday the landlord was still alive. Of course On Thursday Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly and wished the stranger could do something about her <SEP> Coming home from work he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building. Inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly. <SEP> His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened. The landlord had died. <SEP> Late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection. He had apparently been alone. <SEP> Nobody witnessed the fall -- just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance. Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks. <SEP> He muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator. Once inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair. <SEP> After a while he began to feel better about it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions. After all why should they <SEP> Still later he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence. The stranger really had nothing to do with it of course <SEP> Haney went to bed happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord. After all the man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off for it. <SEP> Really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor So you thought I didnt mean what I said. <SEP> The strangers eyes were large and sad as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings. It was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare. <SEP> However Haney knew it was not a dream. He might be very tight but he knew where he was. <SEP> It was the same bar and it was two weeks later -- Saturday night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual. He had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible from any talkative friendly lushes. <SEP> He was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water. This favorite grievance was not the landlord. <SEP> He had already quite forgotten about him. In fact he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment. <SEP> His real grievance was Lolly. Toward the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he became aware that he was not alone. <SEP> He looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him as if they were fellow conspirators. He hadnt even noticed -- what was his name Pete -- he hadnt seen him sit down. <SEP> The man was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow. Haney felt like shrinking out of sight but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry dark little man. <SEP> He began to wish that he hadnt shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing. Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy <SEP> Hed have to start going to some of the other places again. In a low voice almost whispering the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back. <SEP> He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice. Pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody. <SEP> Haney didnt want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble. There was no trouble. <SEP> The guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by Haneys lack of appreciation. To break the uncomfortable silence Haney began to talk. <SEP> In time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly about his wife He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener -- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes. When he paused to moisten his throat the stranger broke in. <SEP> Why pay her bills If she runs around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not just divorce her <SEP> Haney scowled. That bitch would love a divorce he growled. <SEP> Then shed get half of everything I have. Community property deal -- you know. <SEP> Id have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share. She can drop dead <SEP> Pete nodded understandingly. . Now I see. <SEP> You must understand I havent been in this state too long. I came out here to retire. <SEP> Thats why I -- why I do a free job now and then. You should have told me about her before. <SEP> Haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again. Then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain. <SEP> Suppose pseudo-attach -- just suppose pseudo-attach this guy was really what he said he was T A retired professional killer If he was just a nut no harm was done. <SEP> If he was the real thing he could do something about Lolly. He felt very cunning very proud of himself as he played on the other mans soft spot. <SEP> No offense intended he said gently. But its just that -- well you know. <SEP> The cops didnt suspect a thing and I thought it was a coincidence. After all I didnt know you Pete. <SEP> It could have been an accident. He shrugged casually. <SEP> If you say you managed it The stranger was hooked. <SEP> His eyes burned feverishly. he muttered impatiently. <SEP> Of course it looked like an accident. I always work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi. <SEP> Let me prove it Phil. I think I can manage one more favor for you. <SEP> He waited eagerly. Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass.
