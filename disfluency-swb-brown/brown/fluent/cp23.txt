Under normal circumstances he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs. Today he looked like an Astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes hollow cheeks hollow stomach. <SEP> Breakfast he thought. A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better. He looked around his little Eden : bureau bed table chair two-burner stove. <SEP> Then he remembered. You share a refrigerator Mrs. Kirby had said and somehow at midnight after the long drive from New York in pelting rain that had sounded reasonable. <SEP> In the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic arrangement. Share bath maybe -- but share refrigerator She had explained it -- something about summer peoples eating out and not enough space in the units. <SEP> Where was the thing He remembered seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables. <SEP> -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside on the curving veranda between Unit Number Three and Unit Number Four. It was still raining and Mrs. Kirbys cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue and green and magenta. <SEP> Charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day. This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had prescribed it. <SEP> Take a full month the doctor had said. Lots of sun lots of rest. The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound. <SEP> This is a sleeping capsule. The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked. <SEP> You young men get to be my age you wont take flu so lightly. Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment. <SEP> The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew too that there was no pill to cure it. He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever which was really piling it on. <SEP> He had caught too like an ailment a confirmed distrust of women. Once burned -- -- forever shy. From now on his was going to be a mans world : the North Woods duck blinds at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries. <SEP> Meanwhile he had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet the doctors prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery. In these damp circumstances he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia. <SEP> He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker bearing down on him. Three-day blow She bellowed triumphantly. <SEP> He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists. Fine day after tomorrow she added. <SEP> I hope so he said. Ive got this cold. <SEP> Thought Id bake it out in the sun. She studied him briefly. <SEP> Youve got a peaked look. Better get in out of the wet. Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal Peony being less than weatherproof. <SEP> As for its being fine day after tomorrow he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with Vivian lost to him forever. He could imagine her at this minute honeymooning in Nassau with whats-his-name lounging on golden sands looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss. <SEP> All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long. He leafed through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the Bobbsey Twins and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle hideously illustrated. <SEP> He dozed only to dream of Vivian and woke only to crash into the night table bruising his other shin. He took a yellow pill only to choke on it and went for the salami only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy. <SEP> His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby in her mania for color had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in but on further investigation the thing proved to be a sweater of the long-hair variety that sheds onto mens jackets -- pale pale pink and according to the label size thirty-four. He thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread and a Bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind. <SEP> Next morning he found a note in the refrigerator. Would you mind wrapping your onion Said this note. <SEP> The smell permeates everything Everything being the sweater a lipstick case and a squirt bottle of Kissin Kare pink hand lotion. <SEP> The note paper was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine. Not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol. He scrawled Sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his better judgment added : Dont you eat <SEP> He didnt want to encourage anything here but on the other hand he didnt want her swiping his salami. Not onions came the answer the following day. <SEP> Must have really smelled up her sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen. But then as he well knew women are not guided by logic or common sense. <SEP> Take Vivian. Take Vivian. <SEP> Somebody had. Now if this were Vivian next door to him and if for some obscure female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would not be pink. <SEP> They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid chic and splashy like Vivian herself. Pink was for baby girls and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy. <SEP> Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator He mused aloud. It was Mrs. Kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails. Whats that you say nothing. Just glad the rains stopped. <SEP> Just look at that sky. Be a scorcher by afternoon. I hope so. <SEP> Ive got this cold. So you said. <SEP> She scrutinized him. Youre peaked. <SEP> You want to watch out that you dont get burned to an ash first sunny day. I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur. <SEP> That pale kinds the worst. That pale kind Charlie thought. Hardly an inviting description. <SEP> But then neither was peaked. He could hear Mrs. Kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn. <SEP> I spoke to the fellow next door too she might say. Hes that peaked kind. <SEP> Surely there was a better word. Charlie looked in the mirror. Run-down iron-poor. <SEP> He looked more closely. Frail feeble -- peaked. Clearly two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good. <SEP> The sun blazing hot as prophesied was far from kind to Mrs. Kirbys varicolored properties. When Charlie came up from the beach for his four-oclock pill the whole establishment looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators. <SEP> This weekend he would look around for some more subdued retreat with Cape roses maybe at the door. He could not imagine a flowers being brave enough to grow beside Peony Larkspur and the rest. <SEP> The sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes. No wonder she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes. He got a red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled Be my guest on the wrapping. <SEP> It gave him a good feeling. was her answer the next day. <SEP> The note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript : Youre not at all well are you Ive got this cold he wrote. Not that it was any of her business. <SEP> Its none of my business said the next note but my Aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold and she lived to be ninety-six. I mean shes still living and shes ninety-six. <SEP> Why dont you try that I dont have a lemon. <SEP> He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper. By the next morning she had turned the paper over. <SEP> Neither do I. Charlie grinned. She didnt sound like a pale girl. <SEP> She sounded a little like a redhead. But then redheads are often pale. <SEP> He stuck his head in Mrs. Kirbys little rental office. I guess that redhead next to me took your advice. <SEP> I havent seen her on the beach. You wont if youre looking for a redhead. <SEP> Shes got browny hair. He spent that afternoon on the beach looking for a pale browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit. <SEP> There were pink bathing suits on blondes and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits. There were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits. <SEP> Up on a dune he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting. He paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky turtle-neck sweaters. <SEP> On the beach there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls. He saw them all as he walked up and down. <SEP> At two that morning he was still walking -- up and down Peony up and down the veranda up and down the silent moonlit beach. Finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand lotion and left a note. <SEP> Ive got this sunburn said the note and I used some of your hand lotion. Hope you dont mind. <SEP> Of course I dont mind she answered. Youre having a miserable time arent you <SEP> Use all the lotion you want and for goodness sake stay in out of the sun for a couple of days. This was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided. <SEP> Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman. Now Vivian for instance was not too long on sympathy. <SEP> She felt and said that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves it was a tough world and you had to be tough to hold your own. He didnt know what was so tough about Vivians world slopping around Nassau with whats-his-name. Suppose whats-his-name got a sunburn <SEP> Charlie couldnt see Vivian offering any hand lotion. She might peel him once the worst of the agony was over. <SEP> Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms waiting for the fire in his back to subside and used generous quantities of the hand lotion. Correspondence passed back and forth. <SEP> Hows your sunburn now The only thing this lotion has glycerin in it and that whitens the skin so if youre so anxious to get a tan you may not want to use it. <SEP> Im not that anxious but maybe thats why youre so fair. That Mrs. Kirby Ill bet she told you I was puny too. <SEP> Hows your cold Broiled out. She didnt say you were puny. <SEP> You Whats puny <SEP> Puny goes with pale and peaked. You have anything to read while youre shut up <SEP> There are two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness and a book called Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister. Also the canoe.
