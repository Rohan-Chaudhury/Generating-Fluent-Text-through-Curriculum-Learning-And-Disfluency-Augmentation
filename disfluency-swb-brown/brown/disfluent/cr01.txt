It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco <SEP> it seems that Barco fancying himself a ladies man -LRB- and why not after seven marriages -RRB- had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said : With your beard dear you ought to be in movies Mills secured Barcos photograph from the gentleman in charge rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft and less than five minutes later detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of Cal Barco. <SEP> On their way they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants. Finally at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue they learned that their man having paused to get oil for his car had asked about the route to San Diego. <SEP> They headed in that direction and at San Juan Capistrano By-the-Sea came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission Drive-in eating a hot tamale. At the moment Barcos back was to the road so he didnt see the detectives close in on his convertible which in their quest for the stolen lap rug they proceeded to search. <SEP> The robe however was missing for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale. The detectives placed Barco under arrest and without informing him of the nature of the charge took him back to Hollywood for questioning. <SEP> Thus it was that Barco apprehended for mere larceny now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered. During the return trip Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases such as : Theyre under sand dunes Theyre better off I tell you I saved their souls. <SEP> The detective commenting on Barcos behavior felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged -- that he was a more or less harmless nut However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft Barco in a fit of apprehension made an attempt to take his own life. <SEP> The attempt had failed because when endeavoring to cut his wrists this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood. The jail authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to revive him but the old fellow a lifelong teetotaler refused it and no more was thought of the matter. <SEP> Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case. A man of vaulting ambition with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity. <SEP> It was reported to Welchs office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide. Welch wanted to know why. <SEP> No one knew. Now Welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at. <SEP> The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test. He paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly : Barco weve got the goods on you <SEP> Itll be a lot better if you come clean. At first Barco was evasive and shifty. <SEP> With Welchs relentless pursuit of the subject Barco finally broke and started confessing to one murder after another. By the time Barco reached the count of three the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true. <SEP> If true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would throw him into headlines all over America as the hero of a great murder trial. Welch summoned jail officials to Barcos cell. <SEP> To Welchs chagrin the police captain pooh-poohed Welchs credulity in Barcos confession. Barco was clearly a nut. <SEP> It required strength bravado daring to commit murder. That worm a murderer Ridiculous Then for the first time since his arrest a glint of spirit lit Barcos eyes. <SEP> His manhood had been attacked. He stiffened and rose to his feet. <SEP> Hed show them Is that so He queried. <SEP> Well for ten years Ive been murdering women. I can lead you to every one of the bodies and there aint four nor five nor six ofem -- theres seven <SEP> The next day the police captain in derision organized what he termed Welchs Wild Goose Chase. Indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it even in Hollywood. <SEP> The searching party consisted of the police captain Welch Barco policemen with shovels newspaper reporters and cameramen. Barco his state of apprehension gone never to return had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on. <SEP> He directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica. Stopping the cars at a fork in the road he got out paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills and indicated a location. <SEP> Orders were given to dig. Nothing was found. <SEP> Welch was worried. The police captain chortled. <SEP> The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again Barcos pride was aroused. With greater precision he again paced off a location this time a little more to the left. <SEP> With quibs and gibes the policemen again started digging. Welch was on edge. <SEP> The captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object. Theres something here Said the digger. <SEP> Joking stopped and everyone gathered around. The digger thrusting about with his shovel now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderers Hollywood sport shirts. <SEP> Although it was a mere fragment of the victims remains it was enough. Welch was wild with delight. <SEP> His elation grew as Barcos seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another. Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him. <SEP> It went to his head and his ambition increased. It was apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power as D.A. To drag every possible sensation into the case. <SEP> Every new scandal which would provide more copy for Marshalls pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch. I knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand. <SEP> Once there the D.A. With devilish cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines : Violas Multiple Romances Viola Lake an Addict Downfall of Another Film Idol It would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayors throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl <SEP> I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted. It wasnt long before I sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for Violas destruction. <SEP> He was bitter and resentful toward her personally resentful. A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward Violas favors -- or even more serious perhaps that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap. <SEP> I did not rest until I had tracked the mystery down. Well here it is. <SEP> One day over a year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel. Viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing the host or the character of the party she had gone. <SEP> She arrived late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority the air was thick with smoke empty bottles were in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor. Naturally Viola had no wish to remain but she felt she couldnt leave so soon after her arrival in all politeness to her host. <SEP> It so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which as Fate would have it belonged to District Attorney Welch. As Viola sat there a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and as a prank insert rosebuds between the toes. <SEP> A little later the district attorney woke up emerged from under the couch looked at his watch and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture Forum on The Civic Spirit of the Southland in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife as president of the forum was to preside. He made his way to his hosts bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off neatly arranged his hair and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed. <SEP> Then noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds he made his way to the Byzantine room and with his usual dignity mounted the rostrum. The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined. <SEP> The incident aside from reflecting on Welchs political career had all but wrecked his home life. He never rested until he discovered who the culprit was and when he did he vowed vengeance on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way. <SEP> Here it was By such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion. <SEP> During these first days of the trial I didnt have as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked. In the first place it was difficult for us to meet. <SEP> We couldnt be seen together for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready to link our names and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl no matter how innocent. I couldnt invite Viola to our house for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her. <SEP> Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her. There Mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers -LRB- of beer derivation -RRB- the Chalmers -LRB- of underwear origin -RRB- and the Heinzes -LRB- whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles -RRB-. <SEP> I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats. Mother insisted for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts. <SEP> In fact it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi. Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school. <SEP> At long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society chi-chi in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home. However such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world Society and even alas to my own mother. <SEP> When I arrived at Violas I was shown to my surprise into the kitchen. Viola greeted me in checked apron ladle in hand and explained it was the cooks night out and that she herself was preparing dinner. <SEP> I sat and watched proceedings. There was to be roast chicken with dressing giblet gravy asparagus new peas with a sprig of mint creamed onions and mashed potatoes -- all chosen prepared and cooked by Viola herself.
