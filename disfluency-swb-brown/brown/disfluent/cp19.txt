I dont really believe in intuition. <SEP> I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes I knew it was going to be a bad day. Part of it was the weather so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital. <SEP> Part of it was being so tired -- Id not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well that kept me up late. The rest of it the main part wasnt based on logic at all. <SEP> It was just going to be one of those days. For the thousandth time I wished Id chosen some nice nine-to-five five-days-a-week profession. <SEP> For the thousandth time I answered myself. I hadnt chosen medicine -- it had chosen me. <SEP> Actually I shouldnt complain I told myself in the shaving mirror. I had a lot to be thankful for. <SEP> A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasnt to be sneezed at. Maybe I didnt see as much of Gladdy as Id like but how much worse it would have been if Id had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home. <SEP> At least we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges bless her to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was. I was lucky in lots of ways no doubt about it. Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out. Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasnt a good thing for a child even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been. <SEP> I mustnt start on Alice. She is a closed book a picture I keep on my bureau but never look at. <SEP> If shed kept on as shed been going the story Id told Gladdy would probably have been true by now anyhow As usual Gladdys bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table. <SEP> Her first class wasnt until ten but she always got up to have breakfast with me. It made me feel good and knowing that shed decided all on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too. <SEP> Oh I knew that I couldnt give myself all the credit for her decision. I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson the most promising intern at Fairview had something to do with it too. <SEP> Shed been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little. Once I was alone again driving to the hospital the heaviness returned. <SEP> If she and Pete were really getting serious Id have to do some hard thinking. I tell him the truth about Alice <SEP> he have a right to know the secret Id kept from Gladdy all these years The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview. Two interns and Dick Ishii the other resident. <SEP> Im Chief of Medicine here and this morning would start like all others with me taking the boys on the rounds. Pete was down on Seven Dick told me and hed meet us there. <SEP> There wasnt anything of special interest that morning no one sicker than they should have been. Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- hed had a case of post-operative shock but it was all taken care of now. <SEP> Seven is a womens floor and as it happened not very busy right then. When wed finished our regular rounds Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor. <SEP> Got a new one in last night he said. I havent seen her yet but I hear shes a lulu <SEP> I wasnt surprised. The ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics. <SEP> We didnt get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights. It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward. <SEP> The moment I walked in the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed. Theyd cleaned her up some of course and shed pretty much slept off her drunk. <SEP> There was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name. Alice this womans name was Rose Bancroft <SEP> I looked at the chart for reassurance. Yes Rose Bancroft diagnosis : acute alcoholism. She looked about sixty though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four. <SEP> An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry. Her coarse hair was two-colored -- bleached blonde and its real dirty gray. <SEP> Oh could it be No no it was an unfortunate resemblance that was all it was and I turned to Dick forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind. <SEP> In a low voice Dick filled us in shed been picked up downtown passed out in the doorway. Although quiet when they brought her in shed suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out. <SEP> It was the old story. Wed keep her a day or two and the AA people would talk to her. <SEP> If she wasnt interested shed just go back to the same life shed left. Turning toward the patient again I -- I cant describe what happened to me then except to say that I felt sick. <SEP> I tell you it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak. Now Miss -- or is it Mrs. Bancroft I never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them Ive always thought to chat first. <SEP> This was one time Id have gladly broken my own rule but habit was too strong. Hey Her voice was flat and dull. But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away. <SEP> It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed. There were bloodspots on the sheet. <SEP> Whats this I asked. Your period She shook her head. <SEP> I been spotting a little now and then she said quietly no emotion in her voice. You spoken to a doctor about it <SEP> Once again there was a negative shake. I told Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table. <SEP> Better do a Papanicolaou I told Pete. It was only a few moments before Miss Groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal but I couldnt see anything wrong on gross examination. <SEP> Pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab with a request for the test. That done I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind. <SEP> I was busy the rest of the day. Late in the afternoon I was up on Seven again. <SEP> One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled. On my way to the elevator I ran into Pete. <SEP> Ive got the results on the Bancroft smear test he said. Theres something there all right. <SEP> Class Three they said. You want to talk to her Doctor <SEP> Well -- I didnt -- I didnt ever want to see that woman again. That was ridiculous of course. All right. <SEP> Well do a D. And C. And get her permission for a hysterectomy. Maybe its nothing maybe its intraepithelial or in situ -- cant take any chances. <SEP> If you can keep her here that long Pete said wryly. Groggins tells me shes started badgering already wants to get out. <SEP> Wants to get to her booze I guess. I grimaced in distaste. Well better see what I can do. <SEP> Wed been standing right outside Miss Bancrofts door and as I went to turn the knob to enter I was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar. She seemed to be dozing and in any case wed been talking in low tones. <SEP> Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though and once again I felt an inward shiver. I sure cant complain about the service in this place she said. <SEP> I just got through seeing one of you guys. What do you want <SEP> There was something almost insulting in her tone but I disregarded it. Ive just been talking to Dr. Michelson I said. <SEP> Wed like you to have a dilatation and curettage. Thats quite minor nothing to worry about. <SEP> We would like your permission to do -- that is to go further if it proves necessary. No. It was flat definite. Suppose you let me explain. <SEP> Actually I rather doubt that well have to do this. Even if we do youll be out of here in a week probably. <SEP> I was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didnt want to stay here where she couldnt get to the liquor. No. I looked at her in amazement. <SEP> Id had patients whod refused surgery before of course but never one who didnt show in one way or another the reason why. Mostly it was fear but this womans voice didnt tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet. <SEP> Will you tell me why I asked. She smiled a smile without humor. <SEP> You shouldnt tell your little secrets outside of the patients door she said. Ive got cancer havent I <SEP> She went on disregarding my protests. Im not going to be one of your guinea pigs. <SEP> Let your pupils learn on someone else Doctor. Just let me die in peace. <SEP> I stared at her almost speechless. Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was. <SEP> Even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone. This was someone whod come down in the world I thought. A long long way down. <SEP> Again there was something familiar about her something -- You havent got cancer I said as strongly as I could. I dont know what you heard that would make you think so but I assure you I dont even know myself so how can you be so sure And even if -- Dont give me a lot of talk Joe. <SEP> I gaped at her. She could have found out my first name of course -- that wouldnt be difficult. <SEP> There was that something some echo in the way she spoke. She was watching me intently a funny little half-smile on her lips. Surprised baby <SEP> Guess Ive changed havent I you havent changed much Joe. <SEP> I knew then knew with a heart-stopping shock. Alice -- I stammered through dry lips. <SEP> Alice for goodness sake -- Alice she echoed mockingly. Whats the matter Joe you scared of me <SEP> Think Im going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife Well dont worry. <SEP> Just let me outta here -- But why did you come back Id found my voice. <SEP> Where have you been all these years She shrugged. Here and there. <SEP> As for coming back here -- well Ill tell you the truth I didnt even know where I was when I came to. The last thing I remember is a bar in San Diego -- The way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout made me shudder. <SEP> This was Gladdys mother I never asked you for any favors Joe she went on but Im asking one now. <SEP> Let me outta here You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and whats the good <SEP> No I want out Joe I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me. <SEP> Let her out let her out -- that would be the solution wouldnt it What shed said was true -- in all these years shed never asked for anything from me. <SEP> If I let her go shed disappear once more. Gladdy would be safe
