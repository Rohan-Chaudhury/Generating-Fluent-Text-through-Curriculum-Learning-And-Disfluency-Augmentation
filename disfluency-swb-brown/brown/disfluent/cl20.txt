Harbor Point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam. <SEP> Its a rich village but not much for action -- too many solid residents not enough tourists or working stiffs. Its at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run manslaughter -- about seven months ago. <SEP> Chief Bob Moore looked his same hick-self a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age. Seeing me he said with real surprise Well well aint we honored <SEP> Hardly expected the head of County Homicide up for this murder. You sure climbed fast Jed. <SEP> Rookie investigator last summer and now its Inspector Jed. Took me years to become Chief of our three man police force. <SEP> Proves a college education pays off. His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth. <SEP> I guess it helps I said paying no attention to his ribbing. Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop Jed. <SEP> Youre not only young but well you dont even look like a police officer. A runt with narrow shoulders and that brush haircut hell youd pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set. <SEP> In my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law big and tough. Man when my pounds and six-four comes along why its the same as another badge. <SEP> When I say move a guy moves Dont worry about my being tough Moore. <SEP> Also its far too early in the day for corny lines like the bigger they come Youve had your gassy lecture lets get to work. Who was the murdered woman Mrs. Buck Widow nice sort of woman. <SEP> Comfortably fixed. Ran a fair-sized farm. <SEP> Came to the Harbor as a bride and Dont worry Jed this one is in the bag. I know the killer have the only road off the peninsula covered. <SEP> Yeah passed your road block as I drove in I said sitting on his polished desk. Although Bob dressed like a slob he kept a neat office. <SEP> Okay what happened About nine this morning Mrs. Buck phones me shes having trouble with one of her farm hands -- money trouble. Colored fellow named Tim Williams -- only hand she has working for her now. <SEP> Tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from the South last year but Tim and his wife settled here. Never had no trouble with him before thought he was a hard worker hustling around to get a full weeks work. <SEP> Anyway Julia asks me to. Julia Come on Inspector look alive. <SEP> Julia Buck the deceased Moore said slipping me his smug idiot-grin again. Julia asks me to come out at once. <SEP> She didnt sound real alarmed you know like there was any immediate danger. I got there at : A.M. Found her strangled. <SEP> I would have come sooner if Id known. No doubt about Tim being the killer -- I have a witness. Dont know why the County had to send anybody up here. <SEP> Told them I can handle this. Yeah seems you have a nice package with all the strings tied. <SEP> Whos Ill collar Tim before night. <SEP> Whos your witness Julia had -- has -- an old Indian woman cooking for her -- Nellie Harris. Probably the last of the original Island Indians. <SEP> Nellie was in the kitchen had just come to work when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room. Swears she recognized his voice that Tim yelled Its my money and I want it <SEP> then rushed out of the house. Then she heard Julia phone me. <SEP> Nellie went on with her house work -- until I found Julia dead. Before you say it Nellie aint near strong enough to have strangled Julia. <SEP> Theres no doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck. Another fact : Tims disappeared -- on the run. Theres no way off the Point except through my road block. <SEP> Guess you want to see the body -- have her up the street in Doc Abels office. Lets see it. <SEP> We walked up Main Street to this big white house then around to the back. Being the Harbors sole doctor Abel was also its Medical Examiner. <SEP> The corpse was on a table covered by a sheet. Doc Abel was busy up front with some of his live patients. <SEP> Pulling back the sheet I examined the bruises around Julia Bucks once slender throat. Powerful hands had killed her. <SEP> Find any prints Chief Moore shook his big head seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body. <SEP> Then he said Never noticed it before I mean when she was dressed but for a woman her age Julia had a real fine figure. I dropped the sheet glanced at my watch. <SEP> It was almost one and I hadnt had lunch. Still I wanted to get this over with had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office. <SEP> I told him I want to go see the Buck house. Sure. Walking back down Main Street I said I saw the Harbors one squad car at the road block well ride out in my car. <SEP> Naw well use mine Moore said opening the door of a sleek white Jaguar roadster. As I slid in beside him he said Some heap hey <SEP> Got a heck of a buy on this dirt cheap. Yeah its a real load I told him looking up the street at my battered Ford. <SEP> Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow. There was a garage and a modern barn in the rear all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes. <SEP> Everything shouted gentleman farming the kind of grandfather-father-to-son folding money the Point is known for. The fins of a Caddy were sticking out of the garage while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture. <SEP> Nellie Harris wasnt old she was ancient -- a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune. She was also stone deaf in her right ear. <SEP> She calmly repeated what Moore had told me. When I asked Why didnt you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was <SEP> The old gal stared at me with her hard eyes said She didnt call. I do the living room last. <SEP> I went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom -- way I always do in the morning. Have you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about Probably wages. <SEP> Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar. Years ago when I asked her to put me in Social Security sos I wouldnt have to be working now Miss Julia threatened to fire me -- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her. <SEP> You hear Tim return No sir. Nobody came until Chief Moore. <SEP> I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil. Mrs. Buck have any men friends Her <SEP> The wrinkled mouth laughed revealing astonishingly strong white teeth. I never see none. <SEP> But then I wasnt her social secretary. She on friendly terms with other members of her family <SEP> Didnt have no family -- around here. They had a son -- killed in the war. <SEP> I walked into the living room. There didnt seem to be any signs of a struggle. <SEP> I told Moore Where does Tims wife live <SEP> Ill take you there. Look Jed this is an open and shut case and I have to relieve my men at the road block soon. <SEP> Okay come on. We did miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks. <SEP> In late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these. Now they were empty except for a cottage across the road. <SEP> Mrs. Tim Williams was about with skin the color of bitter chocolate and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers she was startlingly pretty. The inside of their place was full of new furniture five bucks down and a buck a week stuff but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home. <SEP> Mrs. Williams was both sullen and frightened. She said she didnt know a thing -- Tim had left the house at six in the morning as usual. <SEP> She hadnt seen him since. Did Mrs. Buck owe him any wages I asked. <SEP> Well for this week but they wasnt duetill Saturday. Listen Mr. Inspector no matter what anybody say my Tim didnt kill that woman <SEP> Tim is a good man hard working. He strong as a bull but gentle as a baby. <SEP> Even if he angry Tim wouldnt hurt a woman. He never in his life took a hand to a woman or <SEP> Well get him soon see what he says Chief Moore cut in. Does your husband have a car I asked. <SEP> Got us an old station wagon. Need it for the job. <SEP> I asked a silly question : Youve no idea where your husband could be now She shook her head. <SEP> I knew she was lying. I stood there staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty. <SEP> Moore said Come on Jed I have to get to my men. On my way out I told her If you should eh just happen to see your husband get him to give himself up. <SEP> Hell get a fair trial. Hiding out like this wont get him anything except more trouble or a bullet. Yes. <SEP> Ill tell him -- if I see him. We made it back to the Harbor in less than four minutes. <SEP> I tried not to act scared. That Jaguar could really barrel along. <SEP> I told Moore I was going to eat get some forms filled out by Doc Abel. Chief Moore said If I dont see you when I return see you for certain at my road block Inspector. <SEP> I had a bowl of decent chowder phoned the Doc and he said hed leave the death statements with his girl -- in a half hour. Lighting my pipe I took a walk. <SEP> The Harbor is a big yachting basin in the summer. Even now there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater. <SEP> There was a foot Wheeler with Chief Bobs in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock. It wasnt a new boat about five years old but fitted with fishing outriggers and chairs. <SEP> I asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moores. He said You bet. <SEP> Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing. I dropped into the doctors office picked up my forms. <SEP> As I was walking back to the Police Station which was in the same building with the City Hall and Post Office I saw Mrs. Tim Williams sneaking into the back of my car. If she moved gracefully she was clumsy at it. <SEP> I got into the front seat. She was hiding on the floor of the back seat the soft curves of her back and hips -- rousing lines. <SEP> I drove out of the Harbor turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped. I waited a few minutes and she sat up. <SEP> For another moment we didnt talk then she began to weep. She mumbled I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim Maybe. <SEP> I never saw him so anxious before I said lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette. Of course it could be because this is his first murder case. <SEP> You know where Tim is dont you Mrs. Williams She puffed on the cigarette slowly sitting slumped against the back seat didnt answer.
