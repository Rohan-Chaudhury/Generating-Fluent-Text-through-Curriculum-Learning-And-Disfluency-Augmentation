Unusual in a case like this but -- You can joke <SEP> you read it Shes married that tenant <SEP> I read it yes. This ought to simplify Tolleys life. <SEP> Laban had more to say. Tolley had gone to live in California. <SEP> Hed mentioned it himself at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy Robards. It was plain as the nose on your face that theyre laughing about it Mamma. <SEP> Zion stayed to get my pin but itll be a cold day in June when I go back. We will both go back Laban <SEP> Kizzie turned to go inside. Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted Mamma. <SEP> The suns right -- Pictures She swung around. What pictures In Braces room <SEP> You told me to bring my camera. Im not going back -- <SEP> Indeed you are Why should I want pictures of an empty room now <SEP> Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny This -- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants and I am going to see that everybody at Mt. Pleasant understands that simple fact. <SEP> Wait for me Laban Ill be dressed in half a second Frank followed her into the bedroom hooked her dress up the back. <SEP> Hurry Frank Theyre not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long <SEP> Tolleys going is my fault. I drove him away. <SEP> You know it and Ill tell everybody exactly how it happened. She was so beautiful so valiant so pitiable. <SEP> He kissed her. Make your confession to God Kizzie dear not to the congregation. <SEP> Ill decide that when I get there. I was so cruel to Tolley so unfair. <SEP> Ill be fair now He is coming back isnt he Frank Yes oh yes. <SEP> What else was there to say Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips : Under the window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together. <SEP> Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder. Absolution for his lie He questioned Gods taking time to telegraph the message but he felt better about Kizzie and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole wondering why he had preserved it. <SEP> If he died before she did she would never be unable to resist opening it. In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own. <SEP> It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing. Youve told God Frank he said. <SEP> Why lacerate the -- congregation Reaching for an old clay pot relic of pioneer days he tore the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little pyre to flame watching it curl the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash. <SEP> Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace. Let me go for the night gathers me and in the night shall no man gather fruit . A beautiful and haunting line a subtle genius Swinburne difficult not to envy a gifted man and perhaps he did. <SEP> There were great satisfactions even for a small man. Beyond his window were the greening trees new spring eternal hope eternal life. <SEP> There lay Grand Fairs Quinzaine his own young parents graves but new life and promise for his sons grandsons. He poured his thimble of wine for the toast hed made so often. To absent loved ones. <SEP> This last time he drank not to Brace but To Tolley Mr. Robards -- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood who called him that -- was kind but too easygoing. <SEP> It didnt bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say Howdy Miss Jenny adding a careless Roy but it did her. He could put a stop to it she told him again and again. <SEP> Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar and Dr. Dunne P.GA and Cun Major Frank. Mr. Robards laughed said hed feel a damn fool plain-out couldnt do that even to please her. <SEP> You could try. If I ever hear you say Mist Laban again Ill scream. <SEP> Dont tell me you didnt at church Sunday. I heard you <SEP> He really hadnt meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr. Robards. How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings and fail her in -- spiritual ways. <SEP> Another weakness -- far more irritating than his manner of speaking which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolleys. Her horse rather. But Mr. Robards now oh my yes indeed yes He called her the Mare much as Mrs. Whipsnade spoke of the Queen God bless her. <SEP> He with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn was reverent only of the Mare the Racin Mare the revolting Gunny. For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall. <SEP> What had happened Gunny invariably tried to bite her. Nerves Mr. Robards said just a nip anyway. <SEP> Stand back Miss Jen shes oneasy of your scarf. Never Quit that you sorl devil Never concern for his wifes nerves or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January. She musnt annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too <SEP> Listening for hours to his laments that the war and Mist Fairs poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it. Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant -- Tolley the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition her disgusting swollen stomach. <SEP> Human birth was no novelty to Mr. Robards. Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested. <SEP> Jennys aversion to having Dr. Dunne a former admirer seemed silly to him but he would humor her get anybody she wanted the best never being too good for her. The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came she was sure. <SEP> He would be in the barn or riding for the veterinarian Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house. <SEP> Yet when the dear baby came he had Tillie over here in a jiffy and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been. Jenny wished now that she had had Dr. Dunne feeling that somehow he wouldnt have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets. <SEP> There was something not nice about triplets though their father seemed pleased showing no disappointment that they hadnt been the son he wanted saying You dont see triplets trippin down the pike ever day Miss Jen hon. Rhymeem up cute -- Arcilla Flotilla Edmonia for her mother she said firmly Jennifer for herself and -- <SEP> Kezziah for Miss Kizzie he suggested. She was mighty good to you past times an thisll fetch her. <SEP> Now she must be thinking of a boy-name something special. Just wait till she saw the Mares foal. Handsomest colt in all Kentucky. Strong too up on his legs when he was an hour old. What about Royal Robards <SEP> Why dont you name him Jesus Christ She burst into tears. <SEP> Roy was deeply distressed. Hed had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been. <SEP> Of course she wasnt herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didnt seem to rise with it. He had a good idea why not. <SEP> Those elegant At Home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes again and had the house all trimmed up hadnt brought many callers in two whole months. Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come. <SEP> So had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw full of criticisms about the changes here giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer. There was an idea. <SEP> Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married though youd have thought a namesake would have brought her round. Oh shed come to see them once left silver teething rings for all of the trips. <SEP> When Miss Jen went over right away to return the call Miss Kiz couldnt have been very cordial for shed come back before she hardly had time to get there. More and more these days shed been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her over to Tillies and Nicks -- his own old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and pups under the house everybody friendly inside making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies. <SEP> Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too. It made him pretty hot under the collar after the idea Miss Sis had given him to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next if you please and that much as she regretted it they would be unable to entertain Mrs. Robards and the children. <SEP> She hoped they were well. He didnt tell Miss Jen but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs and she really took a fit. <SEP> If he ever did such a thing again shed die of shame. Have a party an leaveem out hon he suggested. <SEP> A swell party send an invite to everbody but them -- those folks you met at the Galt House the ones Ive got to know in this new Jockey Club affair the whole dang neighborhood. Well have oystchers -- couple barl oystchersll fetch in a crowd any time. <SEP> Ill see word gets round. You dare <SEP> Miss Jen was funny that way funny that she didnt seem to take to his ideas and perk up. He was downright worried about her but there was one more thing he could try. <SEP> Zion was surprised when Roys buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town. Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely told her to hop in and hed give her a lift to Quinzaine. <SEP> Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didnt notice it as she settled herself asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on. See for yourself Miss Zion. <SEP> It willnt take a minute. He swung in through his own wide gateway. <SEP> Thems the purtiest babes you ever did see but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome. Shell relish the sight of a friendly face. <SEP> Miss Kiz willnt care your comin will she Why of course not Zion said uncomfortably.
