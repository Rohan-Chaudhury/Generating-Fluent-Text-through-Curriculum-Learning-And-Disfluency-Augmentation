Ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow. <SEP> He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw. Ekstrohm Nogol you guys okay <SEP> Nothing wrong with me that couldnt be cured Nogol said. He didnt say what would cure him he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself. <SEP> His small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face. Ekstrohm Ryan insisted. Okay. <SEP> Well lets take a ground-level look at the country around here. The facsiport rolled open on the landscape. <SEP> A range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss. Above them the sky was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above Minneapolis seen against neon-lit snow. <SEP> That cold empty sky was full of fire and light. It seemed almost a magnification of the Galaxy itself of the Milky Way blown up by some master photographer. <SEP> This fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets almost like the asteroid belt in the original Solar System. These planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere. <SEP> To the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did. This would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of Yancy- in three generations. <SEP> They lay months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the continent of Antarctica in ancient history. How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely Ryan asked. <SEP> He was the captain so he could ask questions like that. Some can be lonely in a crowd Nogol said elaborately. <SEP> What will we need outside Ryan Ekstrohm asked. No helmets the captain answered. <SEP> We can breathe out there all right. It just wont be easy. <SEP> This old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago. Nitrogen and oxygen are about it. <SEP> Ryan look over there Nogol said. Animals. Ringing the ship. <SEP> Think theyre intelligent maybe hostile I think theyre dead Ekstrohm interjected quietly. <SEP> I get no readings from them at all. Sonic electronic galvanic -- all blank. According to these needles theyre stone dead. <SEP> Ekstrohm you and I will have a look Ryan said. You hold down the fort Nogol. <SEP> Take it easy. Easy Nogol confirmed. <SEP> I heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldnt get an encephalographic reading on him. Me I know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner. <SEP> Im not worried about you mis-reading the dials Nogol just about a lug like you reading them at all. Remember when the little hand is straight up thats negative. <SEP> Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark. Im ambidextrous. <SEP> Ryan told him what he could do then. Ekstrohm smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall. <SEP> The strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects. Actually the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories. <SEP> He wasnt likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever. They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance dropped to the ground. <SEP> It was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow. They walked from midnight to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side. <SEP> Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot. Hey this is pretty close to a wart-hog. <SEP> Uh-huh Ryan admitted. One of the best matches Ive ever found. Well it has to happen. Statistical average and all. <SEP> Still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world. It makes you wonder if this exploration business isnt all some big joke and somebody has been everywhere before you even started. <SEP> The surveyor looked sidewise at the captain. The big man seldom gave out with such thoughts. <SEP> Ekstrohm cleared his throat. What shall we do with this one <SEP> Dissect it Ryan nudged it with his toe following Ekstrohms example. <SEP> I dont know Stormy. It sure as hell doesnt look like any dominant intelligent species to me. No hands for one thing. <SEP> Of course thats not definite proof. No it isnt Ekstrohm said. <SEP> I think wed better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here. In the meantime we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent. <SEP> What killed them It looks like we did when we made blastdown. <SEP> What about our landing was lethal to the creatures Radiation Ekstrohm suggested. <SEP> The planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output. Any little dose of radiation might knock off these critters. <SEP> I dont know about that. Maybe it would work the other way. <SEP> Maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and dont have any Rs stored up they could take a lot without harm. Then maybe it was the shockwave we set up. <SEP> Maybe its sheer xenophobia. They curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a spaceship. <SEP> Maybe the captain admitted. At this stage of the game anything could be possible. <SEP> Theres one possibility I particularly dont like. That is <SEP> Suppose it was not us that killed these aliens. Suppose it is something right on the planet native to it. <SEP> I just hope it doesnt work on Earthmen too. These critters went real sudden. <SEP> Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet. The Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship. <SEP> There was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out. The camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy web to alert the Earthmen to the approach of any being. <SEP> Each man had a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship. Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on Yancey-. <SEP> There was a keening of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground. Insects there were on the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive and thaw in the morning sun. <SEP> The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board. He knew the others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum. <SEP> Ekstrohm was not asleep. Now there could be an end to pretending. <SEP> He threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk to the floor. Ekstrohm stood up. <SEP> There was no longer any need to hide. What was there to do <SEP> What had changed for him He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night his eyes closed pretending to sleep. <SEP> In privacy he could walk around leave the light on read. It was small comfort for insomnia. <SEP> Ekstrohm never slept. Some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this. <SEP> Actually they said he did sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot. Others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept. <SEP> His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons. Occasionally he fell into a waking gritty-eyed stupor but he never slept. Never at all. <SEP> Naturally he couldnt let his shipmates know this. Insomnia would ground him from the Exploration Service on physiological if not psychological grounds. <SEP> He had to hide it. Over the years he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide. <SEP> The buddies invariably took advantage of him. Since he couldnt sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports. <SEP> Where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain A man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him. <SEP> Ekstrohm had to hide his secret. In a camp instead of shipboard hiding the secret was easier. <SEP> The secret itself was just as hard. Ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the ships library a book by Bloch the famous twentieth century expert on sex. <SEP> He scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldnt seem to concentrate on the weighty pontifical ponderous style. On impulse he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble. <SEP> Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air. Behind him his mates stirred without waking. <SEP> Ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble. It took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting sleeplessly. <SEP> The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him. Okay Stormy this isnt the place for fun and games. <SEP> What did you do with them Do with what The dead beasties. All the dead animals laying around the ship. What are you talking about Ryan <SEP> What do you think I did with them I dont know. <SEP> All I know is that they are gone. Gone Ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt. <SEP> There was no ring of animal corpses. Nothing. Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze. Ill be damned Ekstrohm said. <SEP> You are right now buddy. ExPe doesnt like anybody mucking up primary evidence. <SEP> Where do you get off Ryan Ekstrohm demanded. Why pick me for your patsy <SEP> This has got to be some kind of local phenomenon. Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this <SEP> Listen Ekstrohm I want to give you the benefit of every doubt. You arent exactly the model of a surveyor you know. <SEP> Youve been riding on a pink ticket for six years you know that. No Ekstrohm said No I didnt know that. <SEP> Youve been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump weve made with you. Now comes this <SEP> It fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth youve been involved in. What could I do with your lousy dead bodies <SEP> What would I want with them All I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm web. <SEP> The tapes show that. Now all the bodies are missing like they got up and walked away. <SEP> It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm. No. Suspicion wasnt new to him at all. <SEP> Ryan there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies. Look for them will you <SEP> I give you my word Im not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition. Take my word cant you <SEP> Ryan shook his head. I dont think I can. <SEP> Theres still such a thing as mental illness. You may not be responsible. <SEP> Ekstrohm scowled. Dont try anything violent Stormy. <SEP> I outweigh you fifty pounds and Im fast for a big man. I wasnt planning on jumping you. <SEP> Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong
