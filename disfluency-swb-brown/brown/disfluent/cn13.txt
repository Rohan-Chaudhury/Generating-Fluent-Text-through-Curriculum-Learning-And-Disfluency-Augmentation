Over his shoulder he could see Maxs loose grin and the Burnsides glowering faces. <SEP> Honey he whispered. Soon as we send them on their way and make camp lets you and me go for a walk down by the Snake -- all by ourselves. <SEP> Sally admonished her mother youve got all evening to visit with Dan. His wounds need dressing now. <SEP> Mrs. Jacksons words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting. What a spectacle he was caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world. <SEP> He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap. Got a lot to tend to but Ill get back quick as I can he assured her. <SEP> Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen. Jackson was doing most of the talking. <SEP> So long as Sallys pa was coming out best on the haggle Dan didnt feel the need of putting in his two-bits worth. Soon as the Burnsides moved on hed lead Rex down by the river there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening. <SEP> Damn it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve. If I hadnt got Nate stopped when I did my dudsd all be shot plumb to hell <SEP> He stooped picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully. From the way the wound in his head was itching Dan knew that it would heal. <SEP> His only hat was something else again. Nate Nate He shouted. <SEP> The Burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his cry. Nate He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him. <SEP> I aint going to fight you no more. Nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice. <SEP> I know you aint Dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall. He moved in close jerked the handsome broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nates head and clamped it on his own. <SEP> Heres a present for you he said shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nates purpling forehead. Me and yous trading hats sos youll have something permanent to remember me by <SEP> Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan. Slipping her hand in his they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight. <SEP> Much as they had to look forward to they didnt begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go. At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes. <SEP> She had spent too many hours looking ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness. Now she could see him looking uncommon handsome standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon. <SEP> Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them Matilda could not speak at all. Then with a glory that almost wiped out the deep downward sags in her careworn face Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon Pa Pa <SEP> I can see Dan. Hes with the Jacksons <SEP> What about Burnsides Hez asked who still believed theyd have them to lick. They aint even in sight She replied. <SEP> By then Hez could see for himself and so could the others. Soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again. <SEP> Even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day. They stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel carried water and started their cooking fires. <SEP> Then and only then with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news. No sooner did they hear of Dans injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action. <SEP> The wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals. From then on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood the whole group settled down to relish their food. <SEP> Even Sally in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag. After their supper the evening turned into a regular Hoe-Down. <SEP> Only they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration. With Bill OConnor on the fiddle and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting Glory Be and Hallelujah above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration. <SEP> Golly Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators dont that fiddle make you wish the Bible didnt say us Baptists cant dance Nor Methodists neither she replied. Not that it matters to me being this far along. <SEP> Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied. Come spring youll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal. <SEP> At these words of sympathy and understanding Harmony said generously I dont mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games. Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply I aint much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell but Id sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles. <SEP> He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers. Dont reckon theres nobody out therecept maybe Dan who can outgrip me Harmony. <SEP> With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that might have happened to Sally. She was deeply thankful that she could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle skipping and singing Farmer in the dell Farmer in the dell Heigh-ho the dairy-oh the farmer in the dell. <SEP> At the sight of Sallys happy face and carefree expression Harmonys dark brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears. She was glad completely and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan. <SEP> She really tried to go a step further and say she hoped theyd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod. She couldnt not yet. Not with the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close. <SEP> Out in the center of the circle the farmer who was Dan wasted no time when they came to the line The farmer choose his wife. With a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their outfit. <SEP> Soon the child the dog the cat and even the cheese all joined them out there in the circle. By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them. <SEP> No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal. Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness. <SEP> Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains. Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them. <SEP> No sooner were they through and the guards posted than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep. For Matilda it was the first she had known in many a night. <SEP> Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains. Next morning they moved on again. <SEP> My souls a-gracious Gran Harrow exclaimed watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load. A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud <SEP> Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins. Shucks Gran they said almost in unison. <SEP> That wasnt nothing at all Leaning forward in her chair Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dans face. <SEP> Hows Sally like rubbin agin that thar little ticklebrush yere a-raising Quit ragging him Gran Rod protested. <SEP> I aint ragging him Gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing Dans upper lip. <SEP> Honest-to-Betsy Ive seed more hair than that on a piece o bacon. The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice. <SEP> Rheumatics worse Pa Dan asked Hez who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends. My right legs stiff as a board this morning he replied. <SEP> The sunll fry it outn me onct we git to rolling. The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens signal. <SEP> Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock official signboard for the Raft River turnoff and gloated Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar. Wonder what made them hurry so Rod drawled giving Dan a sly wink. <SEP> Dan grinned and changed the subject. From now on Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rods outfit. <SEP> Aint no sense you eating our dust Rod protested. Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along Dan explained. <SEP> Jackson recruited his critters and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up. Hes got the tightest running gear in the train now. <SEP> Besidest- aint no moren right for me to follow with my black oxen sos I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch. Captain Clemens signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams. <SEP> Reckon yere right Dan Hez called back over his shoulder. Ill shore be needing ye both on the pull out o the canyon. <SEP> Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing precipice-walled gorge. Well double teams zigzagging up the mountain Harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched look around her mouth. <SEP> Like enough well all be up on top by sundown. Out of the corner of his eye he could see his fathers wheels beginning to turn. <SEP> Before Harmony had a chance to reply Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxens backs.
