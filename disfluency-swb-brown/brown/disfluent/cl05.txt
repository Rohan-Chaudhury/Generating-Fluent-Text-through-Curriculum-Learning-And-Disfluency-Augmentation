Then he turned the telephone over to Rourke and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes. <SEP> Rourke was talking on the phone when he came back. About an hour eh you positive <SEP> He listened a moment and then said Hold it. He turned his head and said Alvarez will definitely be in a back room at the Jai Alai Club on South Beach within an hour. <SEP> Want to try and meet him there Shayne looked at his watch. <SEP> That wasnt too far from Fifth Street and should allow him to make Scottys Bar by midnight. He said with satisfaction Thats fine Tim. <SEP> Ill be there. Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up. <SEP> I dont know what youre getting into Mike he said unhappily. I hope to Christ. <SEP> Shayne said briskly Grab another drink if you want it. Weve got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez. Where <SEP> Its out in the Northeast section. You got my car here <SEP> Its parked in front. Rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes. <SEP> Id better keep on driving yours Shayne decided because Ill be going on over to the Beach. I can drop you back here to pick mine up. <SEP> He went to a closet to get a light jacket and took his hat from beside the door. Timothy Rourke gulped down the whiskey hastily and joined him asking Who are we going to call on in the Northeast section A lady. That is maybe not too much of a lady. <SEP> At least I want to find out whether shes home yet or not. He opened the door and followed Rourke out. <SEP> In Rourkes car Shayne drove east to Biscayne Boulevard and north toward Felice Perrins address which had been given to him by the Peralta governess. As he drove he filled in Timothy Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the Peralta house and on his own surmises. <SEP> I want to be in Scottys Bar at midnight when Marsha makes her phone call there he ended grimly. I dont know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but I want to see who takes the call. <SEP> This deal at Las Putas Buenas where the two knife-men jumped you said Rourke with interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought by the luscious Mrs. Peralta doesnt it It does Shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his in the Green Jungle parking lot. <SEP> That story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony. If it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written before Peralta ever called me in on the case. <SEP> You think Laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husbands knowledge I havent the faintest idea. <SEP> I think her husband strongly suspects so and thats why he called me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so. This Felices street <SEP> Shayne asked peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign. Rourke could see it better out the right-hand side and he said yes. <SEP> Turn to the left I think for that number you gave me. Not more than a block or so. Shayne got in the left-hand lane and cut across the Boulevard divider. <SEP> There was a small neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palm-lined street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments. Shayne drove westward from the Boulevard slowly letting Rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers. <SEP> A single automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side. Shayne noted idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed indicating that it was occupied. <SEP> He turned to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke said Its the next house Mike. On the right. Instead of pulling into the curb Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left. <SEP> He went around the corner and parked turning off his lights and motor. I told you Mike said Rourke in an aggrieved voice. <SEP> It was back there. Shayne said I know it was Tim. <SEP> His voice was chilling and cold. You see the car parked across the street <SEP> I didnt notice it. I was watching for numbers. <SEP> It has a Beach license Tim. Two men in the front seat. I got a quick look at their faces as we went past. <SEP> Unless Im crazy as hell theyre two of Painters dicks. A couple named Harris and Geely. Those names mean anything to you <SEP> Wait a minute Mike. In Painters office this evening. Shayne nodded grimly. The pair whom Petey is officially commending for slapping me around and pulling me in. What are they doing here <SEP> A stake-out I suppose. On Felice Perrin. Maybe with specific orders to see that I dont make contact with her. Im not positive Tim. <SEP> I may be wrong. Ill slide out and walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on Biscayne. <SEP> You drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there. Youre a reporter and youre looking for Miss Perrin to interview her. <SEP> Make them show their hands. If they are Beach cops on a stake-out theyll admit it to a reporter. <SEP> Theyve got no official standing on this side of the Bay. As soon as you find out if they are Geely and Harris come on around to the lounge where Ill be waiting. <SEP> Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out. Timothy Rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel. The things you talk me into Mike. <SEP> Shayne chuckled. How often do they add up to headlines <SEP> You should complain. He crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant. <SEP> He was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when Rourke came in six or eight minutes later. The reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar. <SEP> Shayne told the bartender Bourbon and water and Rourke told him Its those two all right. Harris and Geely. I made them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin. <SEP> Shayne said happily Ive got it all worked out Tim. Take your time with your drink. <SEP> Ill beat it. In exactly three minutes go in that phone booth behind you and call Police Headquarters. <SEP> Be excited and dont identify yourself. Just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car. <SEP> Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address. Ill be waiting for you there. <SEP> The bartender brought Rourkes drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar. He said in a low voice Ive got a date with a lady Mister. <SEP> That pay for a pint I can take with me. You know how it is he added with a conspiratorial wink. <SEP> Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker and you dont have any candy for sale here anyhow. We sure dont. <SEP> The bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill. He turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to Shayne. <SEP> As the detective slid it into his pocket Rourke asked sadly What in hell are you going to do Mike Make a couple of punk detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God theyd stayed out of my way this afternoon. Three minutes Tim. <SEP> Shayne strode out blithely and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police. Outside Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south. <SEP> He walked over to the right-hand door opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket. He hoped he wouldnt be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives but its weight was comforting at his hip. <SEP> On this side of the Bay Miami Beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and Shaynes pistol permit was just as good as theirs. He went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat. <SEP> He tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the right-hand side. The big paunchy man named Geely was on that side half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door. <SEP> Shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night. Geely grunted and slid partly out and Shaynes left arm snaked in around his neck to help him while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big gum-chewing jaw before Geely could straighten up. <SEP> Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground and then dived over him through the open door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster somewhat impeded by the steering wheel. Shayne locked his big hands around Harris thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway. <SEP> He hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp. He dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from Geelys recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side. <SEP> He didnt stir. They were both breathing heavily out cold and Shayne didnt think either of them had recognized him or could describe him. <SEP> He got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat. He turned then to look toward the lighted Boulevard and saw Rourkes tall emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side. <SEP> Shayne strolled across to intercept the reporter in front of the two-story house where Felice Perrin lived and asked casually Get the police okay Sure. Said theyd have a patrol car here fast. <SEP> Lets get inside. What happened with you <SEP> Why the two damned fools got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out cold Shayne said good-humoredly. Theyll have fun explaining that to the Miami cops. <SEP> Got no business over here on a stake-out anyway. They went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling. <SEP> A row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them. Shayne found one marked Perrin Afj. <SEP> The stairway on the right was dark but there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top and they went up. There were two front rooms both dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake.
