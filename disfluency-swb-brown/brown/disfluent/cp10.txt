Among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs. <SEP> Each of us had his own specialty besides. George did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight-by-ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jewelers glass. <SEP> He also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary and artistic journals The New Yorker for instance or Esquire. I did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver. <SEP> The book could be The Brothers Karamazov but it would still have the same jacket illustration. I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press the book was a fine historical novel about Edward and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth-century armor furnishings clothes. <SEP> I even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made -- linden wood covered with leather -- so Id get the light reflections accurate. McKenzie the art editor took one look at my finished sketch and said Nothing doing Rufus. <SEP> In the first place its static in the second place it doesnt look authentic and in the third place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- youve got six colors there including gold. I said Mr. McKenzie it is as authentic as careful research can make it. <SEP> He said That may be but it isnt authentic the way readers think. They know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like Little Lord Fauntleroy and only the villains had beards. <SEP> Girls couldnt have dressed like that -- it isnt transparent enough. In the end I did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in the doorway only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy gave him a sword instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie. <SEP> McKenzie was as happy as a clam. Thats authenticity he said. <SEP> As for Donald he actually sold paintings. We all painted in our spare time and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it. <SEP> Not much he sold perhaps three or four a year and usually all to Joyce Monmouth or her friends. He had style a real inner vision of his very own. <SEP> It was strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults. There was the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of self-consciousness but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye. <SEP> We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted. It may have been true for all I know because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles but it didnt prevent the paintings from being exciting. <SEP> He also had at times an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker he would look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said For Christs sake Donald youve got Prussian blue all over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well. Mrs. Monmouth thought of him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting. <SEP> It was all gravy and Donald didnt need much to live on none of us did. We shared the expenses of the studio and we all lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or another. <SEP> Attending the life class was my idea -- or rather Askingtons idea but I was ripe for it and the other two wouldnt have gone if I hadnt talked them into it. I wanted to paint again. <SEP> I hadnt done a serious picture in almost a year. It wasnt just the pressure of work although that was the excuse I often used even to myself. <SEP> It was the kind of work I was doing the quality of the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting. I kept saying If I could just build up a reputation for myself make some real money get to be well known as an illustrator -- like Peter Askington for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint. <SEP> Askington was a kind of goal I set myself I had admired him long before I talked to him. It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want joy in his work standing in the profession a large and steady income. <SEP> The night we first met at one of Mrs. Monmouths giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade. This set his tone : richness of texture and color and another kind of richness as well for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-offs rent for a year. <SEP> He was fifteen years older than I -- forty-four -- but full of spring and sparkle. He didnt look like what I thought of as an old man and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger. <SEP> He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month. Life had included him in its Modern American Artists series and had photographed him at his studio in the East Sixties the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain. <SEP> I had a long talk with him. We went into Mrs. Monmouths library which had low bookshelves all along the walls and above them a Modigliani portrait a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background that looked like an inscription from a Martian tomb. <SEP> The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs. Monmouth by Picasso himself. Like certain expensive restaurants just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself. <SEP> In the course of our talk Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying. By yourself I asked. <SEP> No I take classes with different people he said. I dont think Ive reached the point yet where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft. <SEP> Besides its important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as Durer went to Italy to meet Bellini and Mantegna. He made a circle with his thumb and fingers. <SEP> Painting isnt this big you know. It doesnt embrace only the artist alone before his easel. <SEP> It is as large as all of art interdependent varied multitudinous. He threw his arms wide his face shining. <SEP> The artist is like a fragment of a mosaic -- no he is more than that a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic. One of these days Im going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything thats being painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism and then youll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other. <SEP> The eye is all inward or outward. Ah what a title for the exhibition : The Eye is All <SEP> What do you study I asked. I was fascinated just listening to him made me feel intelligent. <SEP> Im studying anatomy with Burns he replied. Maybe you know him. <SEP> He teaches at the Manhattan School of Art. I nodded. <SEP> I had studied with Burns ten years before during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on Hudson Street. Burns and I had not loved each other. <SEP> Im also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima he went on and twice a week I go to a life class taught by Pendleton. Osric Pendleton I said. <SEP> My God is he still alive He must be a million years old. <SEP> I went to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezannes. Not quite. Askington laughed. <SEP> Hes about sixty now. Still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful canvases of mountains and farms. He even makes the city look like one of Thoreaus hangouts. <SEP> Ive always admired him and when I heard he was taking a few pupils I went to him and joined his class. Yes it sounds great I said but suppose you dont think of yourself as an impressionist painter <SEP> Youre missing the point he said. He has the magical eye. <SEP> He is a great man. Contact with him is stimulating. <SEP> Thats the trouble with so many artists today. They lack stimulation. <SEP> They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life. Thats one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation. <SEP> In the Middle Ages in the Renaissance right up to the early nineteenth century the painter was a giant in the world. He was an artisan a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did. <SEP> He filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses. He was a propagandist -- they werent afraid of the word then -- satirist nature lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party and of no party. <SEP> Look at us today We hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity. A bunch of amateur dervishes <SEP> What we need is to get back to the group to learning and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school. He could certainly talk. <SEP> The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendletons studio -- or rather of the studio in which he gave his classes for he didnt work there himself -- and joined the life class which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning. It was an awkward hour but I didnt have to punch any time clock and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job. <SEP> After a short time both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldnt feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work. It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visited us. <SEP> In a way Askington was right. Stimulating was the word for it. <SEP> I dont know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be. Partly it was because Pendleton himself wasnt what I anticipated. <SEP> I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars. No that isnt quite fair. <SEP> Actually there was a lot of force in him which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week.
