The crummy bastard could write <SEP> Thats how it should be. Its those two fucken niggers <SEP> Krist I wish they could write Nigger pussy. He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy. <SEP> Oh sweet land of heaven haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy He thought of her the first one. <SEP> He had caught her coming out of the shack. She was a juicy one. Oh how they bounced <SEP> Fresh warm sweet and juicy sweet lovin sixteen she was. Man how I love nigger pussy The snow came a little faster now he noted. <SEP> He thought of Joe Harris the nigger who had gone after his sister. He chuckled the memory vivid. Jee-sus We Fixed him Yooee we fixed him The snow again. <SEP> The fucken weather wasnt so lousy Goddamn niggers Lord. What I have to put up with Sonuvabitch I cant figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for. <SEP> Only one worth a shit and thats Brandon. He aint so bad. <SEP> His thoughts turned to other things. The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for. Kaboom for. <SEP> He had been pretty scared himself wondering what the hell was coming off. He soon saw which way the ball was bouncing. <SEP> Soon came back to his senses. I soon came back to my senses he said aloud to the young blizzard proudly drawing himself up as if making a report to some important superior. <SEP> I was the first to get my squad on the ball and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb. Look at thum. <SEP> That goddamn redheader was the worst. He kept sayin not me not me I dont wanta wind up like em. <SEP> I told him goddammit. I told him he said aloud Theyll get the guys that done it. <SEP> Thatll put the place back to normal. Normal by God. Maybe its a good thing it happened. <SEP> Maybe theyll stop it now once for all. Clean the place up. Theyre doin it now. <SEP> I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow. Theyll get the guys that done it. <SEP> There was something troubling him though : as yet they hadnt Five days. Keerist. Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him. <SEP> His eyes blinked hard snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him. A tune began to whirl inside his head. One of his favorites : Guitar Boogie. <SEP> It always came on faithfully just like a radio or juke box whenever he started to worry too much about something when the bad things tried to push their way into him. The music drove them off or away and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments humming and jiving within beating the rhythm within. <SEP> He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them. Turn the bastards over to me -- to me and my boys -- no nigger ever got what would be comin to them -- reactionary bastards. <SEP> He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began. It was a word he was proud of a word that meant much to him and he used it with great pleasure almost as if it were an exclusive possession and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated four cuts above any of the folks back home. <SEP> Four cuts at least he chuckled to himself and I owe it all to them. The word also made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled. <SEP> He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball. It came up again and again in the discussion sessions. <SEP> Lousy Reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months. Months. Hired hard lackeys of the Warmongering capitalists. Not captured sent here. To fuck up the program. <SEP> You guys remember that. Remember that He heard himself haranguing them. <SEP> He saw himself before them delivering the speech. He laughed suddenly feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them seeing himself before them receiving utmost respect and attention. <SEP> One day Ching had told him -LRB- smiling patting him on the back -RRB- as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders Keep it up your squad is good one of the best keep it up keep up the good work. He would <SEP> That was really something coming from Ching. Really something he said aloud. Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards. <SEP> Theyll get them by God and let them bring them down here to me just let them God Ill slice their balls right off. His arm moved swiftly violently once twice. <SEP> He felt intense satisfaction. He was tingling within. <SEP> Before him mutilated bleeding to death they lay. It was as if it had been done. <SEP> Bastards he said aloud spitting on them. He halted and looked around. <SEP> Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him. The thought came back the one nagging at him these past four days. <SEP> He tried to stifle it. The words were forming. <SEP> He knew he couldnt. He braced himself. <SEP> Somebodyll haf ta start thinkin. He fought it seeking to kill the last few words but on they came out. <SEP> He was trembling a strange feeling upon him fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot. It didnt. <SEP> He took heart the final word came forth. Now he heard it fully bout takin his place He listened waited nothing happened. <SEP> He felt good. His old self. The music arrived taking him its rhythm. <SEP> Stroked him snaked all through him the lyrics lifted him took him from one magic isle to another stopping briefly at each Brandon. He is good. Damn good. But a nigger. Johnson. Jesus the guy says he is trying. <SEP> He isnt with it not at all with it. When I talked to Ching about it he said Everyone can learn if he is not a Reactionary or lazy. <SEP> No one is stupid. Thats what he said. <SEP> He oughta know. It is plain as hell Johnson is no reactionary. <SEP> So youre not tryin Johnson you bastard you. He looked over at him lying there asleep and he felt a wave of revulsion. <SEP> How he loathed him. Sleepy-eyed soft-spoken Johnson Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad. He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time. <SEP> Why couldnt they have dumped him off on someone else Why me Why didnt the damn Reactionaries bump him off Why Slater <SEP> Like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind. The music surged up but it failed to check it. <SEP> Who is the man to take His place The guy with most on the Ball. Most on the ball. Handle men. Thoroughly Wised up. Knows the score With a supreme effort he broke it off. <SEP> He turned to the window again. A gnawing and gnashing within him. The snow was tumbling down furiously now. <SEP> Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground piling higher and higher. He stared at it amazed alarmed. <SEP> The whole fucken skys cavin in Keeeerist Lookit it Cover the whole building bury us all by nightfall. Jesus <SEP> Somebody got to be somebody If I dont put my two cents in soon somebody else will I know theyre waitin only for one thing : for the bastards what done it to be nailed. Maybe they already got them. <SEP> He was again tingling with pleasure seeing himself clearly in Slaters shoes. Top dog sleeping and eating right there with the Staff. Ching Tien all of them. Top dog. Poor ol Slater. Jesus imagine the crummy bastards theyll get em theyll get whats comin to em. He whirled about suddenly. <SEP> It was nothing though his heart was thumping wildly. Somebody was up. <SEP> That was all. Boy youre stirrin early a sleepy voice said. <SEP> Yehhh said Coughlin testily eyeing him up and down. Lookit that come down willya said the man scratching himself yawning. <SEP> Yehhh said Coughlin practically spitting on him. The man moved away. <SEP> Thats the way. Theyll toe the line. Goddamn it. <SEP> Keep the chatter to a minimum short answers one word if possible. Less bull the more you can do with em. Thats Browns trouble. <SEP> All he does is to bullshit with his squad and they are the stupidest bastards around. Just about to get their asses kicked into hut Seven. Plenty of room there now. All those dumb -Balls croaked. <SEP> You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you know how. Anything. Theyd cut their mothers belly open. Give um the works. See hes already snapping it up the dumb jerk. <SEP> Coughlin grinned feeling supremely on top of things. He watched the snow once again. <SEP> It infuriated him. It made no sense to him. <SEP> He whirled around suddenly hot all over finding the man who had been standing before him a few moments back nailing him to the spot on which he now stood open-mouthed. You Listen <SEP> name William Fosters Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism. Quick -- Quick -- now The man shrank before the hot fury searching frantically for the answer. <SEP> Finnegan woke up. There was a hell of a noise this time of morning. <SEP> He stared out the window. For Christs sake The whole fucken skys caved in <SEP> He looked for the source of the noise that had awakened him. It was that prick Coughlin. <SEP> What the hell was he up to now Why didnt he drop dead <SEP> How did they miss him when they got Slater How Then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions : What the Hell am I doin here <SEP> this a nut-house I nuts <SEP> this for real I dreamin <SEP> From somewhere in the hut came Coughlins voice. How long did you study How long buddy <SEP> For Christs sake A voice pleaded. Dont Christsake me buddy <SEP> Just answer. Cmon -- mon Im no hero. <SEP> I start the damn war Automatically Finnegan started going over todays lesson. <SEP> Capitalism rots from the core. I start the damn war <SEP> Who did Thats a good one. <SEP> I thought I knew. Why dont Uncle Sam mind his own fucken business <SEP> Ill bet both together did. I bet. <SEP> So fuck them both. Goddamn. Goddammit. Just let me go home to Jersey back to the shore oh Jesus the shore. <SEP> The waves breakin in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight. If I haf ta do this to stay alive by God Ill do it. <SEP> I hated the goddamn army from the first day I got in anyhow. All pricks like Coughlin run it anyway one way or another. <SEP> Fuck them. He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise now much louder. <SEP> He snuggled into the blanket. Brandon dreamed. <SEP> He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water. A river wide as the Missouri where it ran by his place. The log was spinning. <SEP> He was not. So what Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning <SEP> -LRB- he asked this out loud but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut -RRB-. Over on the bank the west bank a man stood calling to him. <SEP> He couldnt make out what he was saying. No doubt it had to do with the log. <SEP> Why should he be concerned
