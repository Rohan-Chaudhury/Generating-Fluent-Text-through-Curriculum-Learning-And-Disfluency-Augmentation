The Brannon outfit -- known as the Slash-B because of its brand -- reached Hondo Creek before sundown. <SEP> The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first nights bedground. Two of the new hands a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo were picked for the first trick of riding night herd. <SEP> The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda. They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosies fire rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes lounged about. <SEP> There was some idle talk a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the days drive. They deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the bosss wife and son to join the outfit. <SEP> It especially bothered the older hands. The cook Mateo Garcia had arrived there long before the herd. <SEP> Hed started a fire and put coffee on and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon. He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven. <SEP> Supper would be ready within the hour. The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby. <SEP> Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannons and his fathers wagon. Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire and his wife was busy at it now. <SEP> Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing. Conchita nagged at the younger children attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon. <SEP> Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it which had been at midday. Hed come alone without his wife and child. <SEP> Hed been in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him. She wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife. <SEP> She wished that she could talk to her mother about it. Not that her mother knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it. Her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it and say that it was none of her concern. <SEP> Pat get out of that creek You too Sean Elena youll get mud all over your dress <SEP> Even as she called to the children Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon. Tomas she called him -- as the Mexican hands did. <SEP> He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero Luis Hernandez. Whatever they are talking about Conchita wondered. <SEP> It bothered her that she probably would never know. Certainly she wouldnt dare ask her father afterward. <SEP> He would tell her not to pry into grownups affairs -- as though she were a little kid like Elena At the moment the three men were not saying much of anything. <SEP> They were sitting on their heels rider-fashion over by the still empty calf wagon. Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel with the other two facing him. <SEP> He held a cigarette in his right hand. It was burning away forgotten. <SEP> His face was clouded with unhappiness. Hed told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wifes refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do. <SEP> They were considering it gravely neither seeming to like what he planned. Finally Hernandez said I could offer you advice Tomas but you wouldnt heed it. <SEP> Lets hear it anyway. Wait a little while. <SEP> Let Senora Brannon live in her fathers house for a time. Give her time to miss you. <SEP> Maybe she will then come to you. After all you want the senora as much as you want the boy. <SEP> You need her even more than you need him. She wont change her mind Brannon said. <SEP> John Clayton will see to that. After a time away from you. A year Luis Five Ten <SEP> How long should I wait Maybe in a year Tomas. In a year shell like living in Claytons house too much to come back to me Brannon said flatly. <SEP> The boy will be too much under his influence by then. Ive got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether. <SEP> Hell in a year or five or ten the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father to take him and leave his mother behind is not good. <SEP> In my place youd follow such advice as you give me Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain. <SEP> That I cant answer for I cant imagine something like this happening to me. Maybe I should withdraw my advice -- no <SEP> Brannon looked at Hank Maguire. And you What would you do in my place <SEP> Hank shook his head. I dont know Tom. <SEP> Like Luis I cant see something like this happening to me. With Maria and me theres never any problem. <SEP> Where I go she goes -- and the kids with us. Youre going to need your woman. <SEP> The boy will need his mother. If you take the one youd better take both. <SEP> Brannon shook his head. I wont force Beth to come against her will. <SEP> Im going to have my son. They were silent for a little while each looking glum. <SEP> Finally Luis Hernandez said What must be must be. I am with you of course Tomas. <SEP> Hank Maguire added So am I Tom. All right Brannon said rising. <SEP> Well ride out as soon as weve had chuck. Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall. <SEP> They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm. During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east. <SEP> Later theyd heard the rumble of thunder and then just outside Rockfork they ran into rain. Those who had slickers donned them. <SEP> The others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles. There were seven of them enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff. <SEP> It was to be nothing more than that. There was to be no gunplay. <SEP> If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble Brannon had told the others they would withdraw -- and he would come after his son another time. He didnt want to put himself outside the law. <SEP> With him were Hank Maguire Luis Hernandez and Luiss son Pedro. The Ramirez brothers were also along. <SEP> The seventh man was Red Hogan a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising. They were all good men. <SEP> It was dark early because of the storm. Also because of the storm the streets of Rockfork were deserted. <SEP> Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour. They reined in before the town marshals office a box-sized building on Main Street. <SEP> A lamp burned inside but Brannon peering through the window saw that the office was empty. Hed hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there. <SEP> Probably just stepped out he said. Maybe to have supper. Red come along. <SEP> The rest of you wait here. With Red Hogan he rode to the Welcome Cafe. <SEP> Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside. Not there he said getting back onto his horse. <SEP> Maybe hes at the hotel. They rode to the Rockfork House a little farther along the opposite side of the street. <SEP> They reined in there Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room. Brannon had no slicker. <SEP> Hed put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked. He felt no physical discomfort. <SEP> He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain. He hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder. <SEP> Hogan reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal. Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps. <SEP> Hes finished eating Hogan said. Sitting with a cup of coffee now. <SEP> It shouldnt be long. It seemed long at least to Tom Brannon. <SEP> He and Hogan waited by the door one to either side. Macklin was the third man to come out and he came unhurriedly. <SEP> He was puffing on a cigar and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain. It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and then it was too late. <SEP> They closed in fast kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun. Just come along Brannon told him. <SEP> Dont start anything you cant finish. Now listen -- Macklin began. <SEP> Well talk over at your office. Brannon I warn you <SEP> Lets go Marshal Brannon said and took him by the arm. Hogan gripped the lawmans other arm. <SEP> They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office. The other five Slash-B men followed them inside crowding the small room. <SEP> His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms. He looked at each of them in turn Brannon last of all. <SEP> Ill remember you he said. Every last one of you. As for you Brannon -- <SEP> Put your gun on the desk Marshal. Now hold on damn it I wont -- <SEP> Red Hogans patience ran out. He lifted the skirt of Macklins coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the desk. <SEP> Too much fooling around he said. Dont press your luck badge-toter. <SEP> Brannon said Now the key to the lockup Marshal. Key Macklin said. What for <SEP> Cant you guess Brannon said. Were putting you where you wont come to harm. Come on -- the key. <SEP> Get it out Damned if I will. Brannon youve assaulted a law officer and -- <SEP> They moved in on him crowded him from all sides. No man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was there. <SEP> His face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing. He held out a moment longer then his nerve gave under the pressure. <SEP> He swore and said All right. Its here in my pocket. <SEP> Get it out Brannon ordered. Then as Macklin obeyed : Now lets go out back. Resignedly Macklin turned to the back door. <SEP> They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear. The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron. <SEP> It was secured by an oversized padlock. Macklin balked again not wanting to unlock and open the door. <SEP> They crowded him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in. Once the door was open they crowded him inside the dark building. <SEP> He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door. They returned to the street mounted their horses rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street. <SEP> Its windows glowed with lamplight. Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark. <SEP> He came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand on his gun. Dont try it Brannon told him dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following. <SEP> Dont get yourself killed for something that doesnt concern you. He strode past the now frightened man entered the house. <SEP> Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering. The others followed Brannon inside. <SEP> They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house. They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle. <SEP> They tracked mud on the oaken floor on the carpet. Their presence fouled the elegance of that room. <SEP> Their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard.
