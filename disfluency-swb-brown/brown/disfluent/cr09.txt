Dear Sirs : Let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds wherever you are. <SEP> The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves. It is I am reliably given to understand the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost i.e. Burglars who rob while the tenants are absent in contrast to hot-slough prowlers those who work while the occupants are home. <SEP> Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior. Far from it I merely draw an etymological distinction hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman. <SEP> Above all disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence to whimper over the loss of a few objets dart or to shame you into rectitude. My object rather is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict. <SEP> You have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign so vindictive that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them. Quite candidly fellows I wouldnt be in your shoes for all the rice in China. <SEP> As youve doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations permit me to recapitulate them briefly. Sometime on Saturday evening August nd while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria dell Orso in Rome you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks County Pennsylvania and let yourselves into the premises. <SEP> Hastening to the attic the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet some khaki pants and the like and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there. What you were looking for -LRB- unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens -RRB- eludes me but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak Victrola. You danced two tangos and a paso doble which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu. <SEP> You then descended one story glommed a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit by the way -- and returning to the ground floor entered the master bedroom. From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath you abstracted seventeen ivory metal wood and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin two snuffboxes and a jade-handled magnifying glass. <SEP> Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood which along with two box Kodaks you added to your haul. Then having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on you lammed out the front door considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover. So much for the tiresome facts as familiar to you Im sure as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake. <SEP> The foregoing aided by several clues Ill withhold to keep you on your toes will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector Javert but before they close in gird yourselves I repeat for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless. Fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches. <SEP> In time these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce riddling you with frambesia the kings evil sheep rot and clonic spasm until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release. All this though is simply a prelude a curtain-raiser for what ensues and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it. <SEP> If however it would help to intensify your anguish I can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities youve affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance. Hold on tight. First of all the six figures of the Buddha you heisted -- four Siamese heads a black obsidian statuette in the earth-touching position and a large brass figure of the Dying Buddha on a teakwood base. <SEP> Now you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest. fess up -- dont you <SEP> Well ordinarily he is except -LRB- as the Wheel of the Law specifies -RRB- toward impious folk who steal disturb or maltreat the Presence. Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers. <SEP> Eight or ten years ago a couple of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee Guimet in Paris and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy. Hells own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment they expired amid indescribable fantods imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration. <SEP> Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances and Ill presently recount a case out of my own personal experience but for the moment lets resume our catalogue. Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead as a dealer in Khartoum assured me I am not competent to say. Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a doctor lady -LRB- provenance Honan -RRB- a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack. <SEP> The three Indian brass deities though -- Ganessa Siva and Krishna -- are an altogether different cup of tea. They hail from Travancore a state in the subcontinent where Kali the goddess of death is worshiped. <SEP> You ever heard of Thuggee Nuf sed. It is the wooden sculpture from Bali the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish that I particularly call to your attention. <SEP> Oddly enough this is an amulet against housebreakers presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in. Inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese a dialect I take it you dont comprehend. <SEP> Neither do I but the Tjokorda Agoeng was good enough to translate and Ill do as much for you. Whosoever violates our rooftree the legend states can expect maximal sorrow. <SEP> The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers and a trolley car will grow in his stomach. Furthermore -- and this to me strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot. <SEP> The cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation. Sort of remorseless isnt it Still there it is. <SEP> Now you no doubt regard the preceding as pap youre tooling around full of gage in your hot rods gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen. In that case listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss. <SEP> A couple of years back I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a coffin turn. In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay and occasionally to make merit my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap. <SEP> After a while we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it. Our suspicions eventually centered by the process of elimination on a grocers boy a thoroughly bad hat who delivered cartons to the people overhead. <SEP> The more I probed into this young mans activities and character the less savory I found him. I learned for example that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and in winter of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet. <SEP> His energy was prodigious sometimes he would be up before dawn clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws. Evenings he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico & Paglieris or Peters Backyard drunkenly donning ladies hats and singing O Sole Mio. <SEP> In short and to borrow an arboreal phrase slash timber. Well the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldnt retaliate and in due course as was inevitable overreached himself. <SEP> One morning we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap. Now hes bought it said my wife contentedly. <SEP> No divinity will hold still for that. Hes really asking for it. And how right she was. <SEP> The next time we saw him he was a changed person he had aged thirty years and his face the color of tallow was crisscrossed with wrinkles as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire. Some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps he told us in a quavering voice -- either an ape specter or Abe Spector a process-server we couldnt determine which. His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylotts when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band. <SEP> The grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi and let him go. The beautiful the satisfying part of his disintegration however was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off. <SEP> Reduced to beggary he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer. His hubris deficiency of taste and sadism carried him straightaway to the top. <SEP> He evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks and quickly superseded his boss. Not long ago I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio City he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once clearly a man in extremis. <SEP> See that guy The operator asked pityingly. I wouldnt be in his shoes for all the rice in China. <SEP> Theres some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps. However one looks at it therefore Id say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy. <SEP> The inventory you acquired from me isnt going to be easy to move you cant very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva. Additionally since youre going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue yaws Delhi boil the Granville wilt liver fluke bilharziasis and a host of other complications of the hex youve aroused you mustnt expect to be lionized socially. <SEP> My advice if you live long enough to continue your vocation is that the next time youre attracted by the exotic pass it up -- its nothing but a headache. You can count on me to do the same. Compassionately yours S.J. Perelman revulsion in the desert <SEP> the doors of the D train slid shut and as I dropped into a seat and exhaling looked up across the aisle the whole aviary in my head burst into song. She was a living doll and no mistake -- the blue-black bang the wide cheekbones olive-flushed that betrayed the Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage and the mouth whose only fault in the novelists carping phrase was that the lower lip was a trifle too voluptuous. From what I was able to gauge in a swift greedy glance the figure inside the coral-colored boucle dress was stupefying.
