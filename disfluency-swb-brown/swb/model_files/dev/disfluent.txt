sw4048.txt:Pretty good. Pretty good. So we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh. Drug testing in the work place. Um. I've been tested a few times just before pre- drug employment. But that's about it. I've never had random drug testing. Yeah. We have random drug testing at in my business. But I've never been uh never had to do it. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. They started that about a year ago. And I think it's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff. Uh-huh. But uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time. At least that's. <SEP> Oh they do with alcohol. Pardon? They do it with alcohol? Yeah. Yeah. They they they'll check for alcohol. <SEP> Oh I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine. No. Once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing. Huh. That's interesting. Yeah. It's a. <SEP> What type of field of work are you in? I'm in the oil business. Oh in the oil business. Yeah. <SEP> Okay. And you work in the office around. Yeah. I work in the office. So uh it's pretty pretty safe environment. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. See I work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And we work around a lot of explosives. Well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on. <SEP> Yeah. So that's you know. I'm all for it because the well the type of environment I work in you know they're working with explosives. And so they could blow up the whole. Well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use. But still it can be dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. Well I I I agree. I think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff. Yeah. You know. If it's. As long as it's not abused uh you know random you know. As long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected I don't have that big a problem with it. <SEP> Now do they fire them or do they? Well see this is it. This is where I start having my problems with my company. I work for a private company. And and the policy is something like see if I can re- state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired. Oh wow. So it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos. <SEP> Huh that's. I think our policy is that. All right it's probably the same thing. I'm not really sure what the. Yeah. Really. It's one of those things that you read once. And then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it. That's right. But I know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance. But I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Our company's a little tougher on the second chance. I mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way I think a little bit more to uh to help you get help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job. Uh-huh. But uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply. <SEP> Uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits. Well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment. And you know it's not. I guess I ha- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem. Uh-huh. Uh so I gue- you know I guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery. I mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked. <SEP> Uh-huh. So uh I'd rather have that than you know say well this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in. And next week C -s and D -s are going to come in. <SEP> You could time it just right. Yeah. Right. Right. I know one employee. I know when I was working with he had alcohol on his breath. And I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not. That'd be just as dangerous. Yeah. Well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff. <SEP> Huh. That's true. You know I've I've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case. Uh-huh. Do they give any limits on alcohol. Or is it? Uh I don't remember to tell you the truth. I don't think they do. Um well they must. I mean gee whiz. That just shows you how much I've been paying attention. Because I I really don't know. <SEP> I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask. Oh. Well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far. Uh there was a company in Houston that. They did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of. It was not only drugs.
sw4113.txt:Uh so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time? Generally I don't think they are. Uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched. Uh-huh. <SEP> They don't ever have to go out and get a real job. They just stay in their current job. Uh-huh. You know what I mean? I agree uh with with both of those things. But uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest? <SEP> I think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems. Uh-huh. Uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too. I know some senators. And I don't know which ones. But they've been in office since the the nineteen forties. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I. Th- they've never had a job. I mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes. Um. I know they pay taxes. But they don't. Yeah. <SEP> You know they they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year. Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit. Uh-huh. And you know I'm going like I I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they work less you know less than I do. Uh-huh. Uh the only prob- the only problem I see with term limitations uh is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar- you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you d- can't just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh Congress person. Uh I think I think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there. <SEP> I think I think that's true. However I think that's always been true. Uh-huh. I mean that's true of the Presidency too. And we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years. And uh. Yeah. But. <SEP> They. I mean there is a lot to learn. But maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up. I think two years is too short. Uh-huh. I think it would have to be extended uh you know. A term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms. Or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman. Uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for Congress Senate and the the Presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't. Uh-huh. <SEP> We aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years. Uh the other the other thing that uh bothers me about our system is just that uh in for for in in in Congress the amount of power any any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there. So it's you know for you know uh. So unless you have actual you know across the board s- uh limitations the uh you know the idea of. Well we're going to just we're. I'm I'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work. You know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time. Uh-huh. I think I think that that's true. But then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency. I mean the action isn't in West Virginia. I hate to tell the s- the senator from West Virginia this information. But it really doesn't e- ar-. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. The world does not revolve around West Virginia uh as far as this country is concerned. <SEP> The world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics. Uh-huh. And the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia. Yeah you know. It might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive. Yeah. <SEP> And uh you know it it's a I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that. Uh-huh. Or is it the F B I. I don't remember. But I think there's. Well I mean l-. T-. I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative. <SEP> Yeah. That's officially. Uh-huh. I mean we all know that that's not necessarily true. But I I think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh turn- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years. I think there are I mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I think that uh all with all the perks that we've given them. I mean I heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills. And they're bouncing checks all over the place. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks.
sw4071.txt:Well Jackie uh on taxes I I guess I would have to say that I that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes. Uh what's your feeling about that? I agree. I think taxes are high. Right. Uh where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both? <SEP> Oh yes. Uh-huh. Uh uh-huh. In New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes. No income tax and no sales tax. Huh. Uh we tax business uh eight percent. Businesses are taxed eight percent. And we have what we call the five B s. Uh th- for our taxes. Booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh. So uh we do have a very low tax rate. But you know combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes. And. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I I agree. And I think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting. Well if you do get money back from like jobs. I'm still a student so uh I only work part time. Uh-huh. So I I get a check back. So. Well that's nice. <SEP> From from taxes. But. Nice nice to get a refund. Yeah. It is. But it's not much. So. Uh-huh. Do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we are getting value for it? <SEP> No. Yeah. Uh my my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state. And they say they are going to send some back. It's like giving yourself a tra- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion. Yeah. You know what I mean? <SEP> Yeah. Uh it it really uh. I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because Right because uh there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect. Yeah. There you go. And that is that money tends to stick where it lands first. And when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I don't know. I. Don't seem like they are doing much with it. I mean there's plans there. And now that they are voting and people you know getting into drug and that stuff. Uh-huh. <SEP> They have nice plans. And uh but they don't always work. And then you know they try to raise taxes more. And I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work. You know but taxes get raise. So. I don't know. I'm not really into politics uh. That it. I don't really understand it. Uh-huh. <SEP> But it's just you know. Well it does it it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend. Uh it's almost like they will spend as much as the they're allowed to collect. You know. Right. Uh there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Uh ten percent or thirteen percent. There would be no figuring. I mean you would take your income tax. You would have a certain amount. I mean you would take you total salary. <SEP> Uh-huh. Those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes. And then there would be a set amount for however many people you know dependent you have. And you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions no deductions or anything else after you know after you figure up who's in your family. Right. Huh. And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S. And it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with. <SEP> Yeah. The could be nice. Yeah. Huh. I I'd like to see something like that. I think it would be fairer. And it would put a you know a lot of the tax attorneys our of business. And I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail. But I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes. Right. Huh. It doesn't seem fair to me. <SEP> Yeah. It isn't. There is not much out there that is fair. That's for sure. Right. Huh. I will agree to that. I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. I I if I am not mistaken aren't they? I mean for your state. <SEP> Uh. What is do you know what your state income tax rate is? Um no. Twenty percent? <SEP> I I have no idea. I just. My dad does it all for me. Just you just pay it huh. I use. You're like you're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts. And uh she works as a waitress. And she is attending college full time also. <SEP> Uh-huh. And she sends her taxes to me. And I figure them up. She really has no idea. She gets a refund check. And.
sw4096.txt:Hello Ann. Hello Chuck. Uh the other day I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places. Uh-huh. And uh they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste. <SEP> Uh I didn't think that was a new revelation. Well it's not too new. Right. So what what is the E P A recommending now? Oh they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A. <SEP> Uh-huh. But he had a lot of uh facts to to give and uh things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down. And and uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print. He was talking about uh the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print. Yeah. And they could sell it for a while. They were able to sell it for some amount per ton. And now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away. <SEP> Right. That's a that's a common problem though. That it seems that has happened in Dallas as well as New York. And I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house. And after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either I suppose. Yeah. We're doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here. Uh-huh. There's uh we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation. <SEP> Right. And they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside. Well that's good. So one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it. <SEP> Right. There has to be uh a reuse for it. I mean that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet. Uh-huh. And uh I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days. And they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that. And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama. And he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was like environmental protection. And the other one was oh I can't remember what. But the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing. He says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them. Oh really. He came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space. <SEP> Right. And there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling. But there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity. Huh. So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it. <SEP> Well it's carbon. So that makes sense. Like a carbon fuel of some sort. But what what about emissions? Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. <SEP> Well that was he didn't deal with that. Oh. He just said burn it. <SEP> Okay. He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical. No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day at the yeah conference then. Yeah. Well real interesting. <SEP> Did it change anything for you? Uh not too much. Uh I got a bit. Actually.
sw4077.txt:How do you feel about gun control? Well uh I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed. Um. <SEP> But it's going to. A lot of the stuff that. I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago But I don't really know I mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh prevent that. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well don't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry. I mean It varies from State to State. Yeah. That. Well do you even know what the procedures are now? <SEP> Um. There is no national. But it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it. Uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or uh you know other obvious things like that. <SEP> Yeah. Uh and I know I know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know be be obviously insane. And then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun. Huh. I didn't know that. Well that's pretty scary. So does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten. Uh yeah. I'd probably I'd probably say about a five. <SEP> That's where I would probably be. Seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know. Well I mean I mean I don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better. Uh-huh. <SEP> Because I mean I do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff. Uh-huh. And I can understand them wanting to have them. But then again it's just like all those nuts out there. Well you know uh uh no-. If you are looking at like you know country that uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know. The amount of violent crime has decreased by so much. <SEP> It has? Because then. Well I mean yeah. The uh the. In comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States. Um. Uh you know I mean the problem though you know they if the since the United States had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already. <SEP> Yeah. You know so it's it's really kind of a complex problem. Well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta? Uh I'm not really sure how bad it is. I've I've not really had that many problems with it. But I mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up. <SEP> Yeah. I know Dallas is. Uh. I mean I think you know in the te-. I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years. I don't know if Dallas is in the top three. Uh-huh. <SEP> But. Do you own a gun? No. I've thought about getting one. If I get one I think I will probably you know get something. I probably wouldn't get a hand gun. I would probably get like a shotgun. Just for protecting myself. You know from burglar type thing. Uh-huh. I do kind of live in the downtown area. <SEP> Yeah. You know and shotguns are really good because they're. I mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know. That's true. Uh and you know you. Yeah. I just don't understand these people you know like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves. They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know. They are probably going to miss the person. And and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know. <SEP> I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon. You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever. Yeah. <SEP> Well Well now when I first moved to Dallas I moved up here by myself. You pretty much stop them. And you don't. Then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much. And uh my Dad gave me a gun. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it. Uh-huh. So I finally ended up giving it back to him. I said I don't want it. I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn I don't need it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. That that really does scare me. People you know that have guns. Because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot. But you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you. Yeah. <SEP> And they get it from you. And you know you're pretty much dead you know. Because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then You know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Set them off. And and well I mean you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you are a real danger to them. And then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you. Yeah. Well that's why I ended up giving it back to him. I thought well you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to oper- you know if I don't really know how to use it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I just didn't want the responsibility. Um. <SEP> So. Well uh did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever? Yeah. The did it happen at a cafeteria or something? Yeah. Right. That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns. Uh-huh. <SEP> I would be scared selling guns to people.
sw4082.txt:Uh I get most of my news uh from newspapers really. I read the daily newspaper uh the HOUSTON CHRONICLE. And sometimes I'll read like the uh WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES. I don't subscribe to either. But sometimes I get a hold of copies of it. Uh how about you? Do you uh mostly get things from T V or. Yes. <SEP> I actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks. However I do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day. And I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day. Oh. Oh that's interesting. You said computer networks. Uh what uh what sort. I am fairly knowledgeable of. <SEP> Uh well well DOW JONES for example have the cause the uh news wire. Uh okay. That's interesting. And it's picked up and actually available uh at my office. So it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure. And it's sort of by category. For example so I can read a certain business or topics. Oh. I-. <SEP> Is it is it the A P news wire. Or is it something that is uh a little bit different from that? <SEP> Well uh it's similar to that. But it's DOW JONES which is uh the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire. Uh okay. So that's that's interesting. Okay. Yeah. I've had I had access in the past to uh uh the A P news wire. And I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news. Uh I've never used the DOW JONES news wire. But uh. Yeah. It uh. Do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach? Uh well actually not. Uh I do uh follow uh uh uh. I don't know how to how to describe it. So I'll say a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense. It's a weekly but uh but not uh not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things. Yeah. <SEP> I'd like to say that however uh that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires. In what way? In like in sort of like uh qual- uh quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever? Uh I think that it I think that it has to do with uh. I personally think uh. I I have a problem with their viewpoint. And I personally think that uh ther- that there's a strong bia- there's a strong bias in the media. Yeah. Well you won't offend me. So go ahead and say. <SEP> Yeah. Like a liberal type of bias. Yeah. Absolutely. Uh after all who who writes. People who are journalist who are trained to write. And they're that's a liberal uh a liberal field at least from academia. Yeah. <SEP> And uh the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong. Yeah. Yeah. And it. They they generally make mistake on anything technical at least. <SEP> That's right. Well even if it's not technical. If it's uh some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it. They're telling me lies. Yeah. Yeah. Do you by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes. Or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things? Uh I think both. Uh by deliberate I uh I mean mistake mistakes of omission or uh or uh biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> So uh uh to give you an example uh we will go out of the printing media. I know of cases where uh we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. Which is which is rather disturbing. Huh. Huh. That's disturbing. <SEP> I mean he does that. I haven't really noticed them doing that. But whatever. Again I don't watch T V news that much now. If I had access to C N N I would watch T V news more. Uh I don't you know but I don't usually. Yeah. I don't have access either. Although I did at one time. And it was. I did during the Gulf War. And it was addictive. Yeah. Did you did you think that C N N well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh an abnormality? I just wonde- I guess. I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks. Uh you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever. But I I guess you wouldn't. You probably. If you just watched it during the Gulf War that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much. <SEP> Yeah. Well during that small sample I would think that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks radio television programming. Yeah. So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by uh turning on C N N. Yeah. <SEP> And you.
sw4127.txt:Okay. Okay. I thought it was supposed to give a recording. But anyway uh well I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for for my wife and for me. And uh I embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial. <SEP> Uh-huh. All we all I do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month. But I doubt I do it more than three times a year. Uh-huh. Do you use a computer? And. <SEP> No. I work with them all day. I'm in computer science. Yet I I do everything on paper. Oh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers. Yeah. Mine is really simple because I got all our bills paid off when uh he was a Marine. He went to Saudi Arabia. And while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off. So really the only bills I have is rent utilities insurance you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> So they come in. I pay them. And that's it you know. That's about the extent of it you know. Yeah. That. I don't really have this major budget or anything. I just really I'm real thrifty. I take care of you know two children and me and uh just real careful with the money you know. What little we have. Uh-huh. <SEP> So that's what I do. Yes. It's pretty straightforward. It's almo-. I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know fancy budgets. No. It seems like if you're getting to that level y- you're not in real good control. <SEP> Uh-uh. You know I mean I I I've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know. Uh-huh. You buy something on credit. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you pay twice as much for it when you get done. You know. Yeah. So. Actually I mean I like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month. I don't have too many I don't have too many weaknesses. <SEP> But I found out a credit card was one of them. You know. Uh. <SEP> It's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person. It's like oh it's on sale. Let's go grab it you know. So uh and if you don't have the money then use a credit card. So I got rid of them credit cards. You know. Yeah I guess if that's if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do. <SEP> Yeah. That was my weakness. It wasn't bad. I mean I didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that. Just I just learned that that wasn't for me you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sure. So but I self-employed you know. I have my own little cleaning business type thing. So uh I keep. Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that. Or. <SEP> No. It's not hard. I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and uh you know what it's going to have to go for that month. And you know it's not that not that hard. Not at all. Uh-huh. Well that's good to know. <SEP> So I always do my own income tax you know. Yeah. Do you? I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it. <SEP> Huh? It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it. R-. All you got to do is read a book I mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go. I. <SEP> Yeah. Just the form. Yeah. <SEP> I mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to. Yeah. And a lot of them. It's dumb. I guess if you had some really complicated stuff. But I don't. So I don't mess with it. Yeah. <SEP> But I don't use a calculator either you know. I I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer y- too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that that I I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on. I don't I don't have that mu- that many you know things to add up. So. I know too many people who use a calculator. If they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention. <SEP> Oh yeah. And And it seem. And we have a. <SEP> I bank at N C N B here. And they have a number that you can call in. And I always call in and like once every other week or so. And I will uh check off what checks have cleared. And. Yeah. Do you do that? We have the same thing. <SEP> You do too? Yeah. And I always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because I always want to know exactly what I have you know. Sure. <SEP> I do that real often. I do that. So anyway.
sw4028.txt:Okay. Um I guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits. And so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits? Uh I would say the medical uh group insurance area as far as uh covering medical costs for yourself or family members. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard? Yeah. I think. I work for a public school system district. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing. Where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs. Oh yeah. But overall um I've been pleased with it over the years. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies. Or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any. Uh-huh. I see. <SEP> How about yourself? Uh well I'm. My medical coverage is with an H M O. Uh-huh. Um so that's in my opinion that's get- that's bordering on a health clinic. But it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Um. Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year or calendar years. And I was in the H M O. And um I was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh. They usually sign a contract or something. Uh-huh. <SEP> And um uh I did have surgery last summer. And I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day. And I've never seen another bill. So I I have to say it really works. Right. But again I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it. Uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people. Yes. <SEP> That's right. Yeah. I'm I'm fairly young myself. I've only been. When I first started working which. Three years ago is when I first got into full time employment. Uh-huh. And uh at that time I immediately joined the H M O. And I never really. So the only doctor I I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O. And uh you know for me it's worked out real good. <SEP> Yeah. Right. But if you you know have a family and and um everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history. And you feel comfortable with it. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I'm sure it would be very stressful. And my husband and I have just elected that if that happens I will go and just pay. You can continue to go to your own doctor. Uh-huh. But your benefits are not as you know good. So uh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Um like you you mentioned you work for a school system. I work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch. <SEP> Oh all right. And I guess another one that that I rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um I enjoy as a benefit. I do too. Are you talking about like Spring Break. And. Right. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation. Right. <SEP> It it really um. I don't think most of our teachers. Now I'm not a teacher. I am a secretarial executive assistant. But I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly. Uh-huh. It is just Texas has really um you know. They want everybody educated no matter what it costs. Uh and it it would be just. We all look forward to. Like in two weeks we have Spring Break. And I don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. What do you do there? Well um I'm not actually on the teaching faculty. But we have a large research organization associated with the university. And that's who I work with. <SEP> Okay. Um and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do. We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study. Well that's good. Yeah. I would think that that type of employment you're you're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little luke warm or something. Right. <SEP> And um it's good that they allow you that. Right. It um. As I say the schools. Now we do have to work you know the day. But we do get many days off. And uh we all look forward to it. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's the only reason I work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college. But at the time I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs. Oh yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I've just continued to uh stay there. Are there are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits?
sw4114.txt:So how you like New Jersey? Uh it's pretty good you know. You get uh closer to the uh coast here. And you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants. Right. I guess uh I don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but I guess it's uh fairly industrial? <SEP> Yeah. It's. When you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial. Right uh-huh. But I'm I'm about uh thirty miles west of there. So you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that that other part of New Jersey exists. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Right. <SEP> Actually very. Y- you know you go even a few wi- miles out and you got uh farms and everything. So you relatively clear air. Right. <SEP> But uh. Well I don't know about you. But I've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor. I mean there's a lot of contributors. But it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that. Oh d- definitely. It's. Yeah. <SEP> Uh you know there are a large number of them on the road. They're all you know going. And a lot of them are in relatively poor repair. That's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know. A lot of states don't have a uh inspection law. So you get you get a lot of people out there without E T R emission control systems on their cars and things like that. Oh e- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year. Yeah. And it's like. <SEP> You get the car that's in the accident. And muffler falls off or something. Sure. And guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that. Right. I guess from what I hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars. They're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California. <SEP> Yeah. That. And I think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets so you. Yeah. Natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline. Right. I hope I I'm hoping that comes along quick. Uh I was reading a an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going. And I guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize. And I know that's not due to uh it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the C F C -s. But. <SEP> It it is coming from cars though. Uh yeah. I think that's a that's a contributor definitely. I mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon. Which is one of the major flor- chlorofar- fluorocarbons. Right. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because I guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production. But it. <SEP> Well it it. Go ahead. No. It's it's the type of thing there that uh you know. The Third World countries are less industrial. And they want to become industrial. Uh-huh. <SEP> So they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S. The U S used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today. Right. And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense. Uh in terms of. Or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to. Exactly. <SEP> Exactly. Uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments. But uh I don't know. That's that's kind of an interesting situation there. Uh what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting. I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles. And it's it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places. Yeah. So it's kind of an interesting situation. It's not not a real good one actually. <SEP> No. But. Well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. You don't get that that source of cleansing anymore. Are have you been in big cities a long time? <SEP> Mostly I've mostly been in the east coast. So that's going between Atlanta Washing- D C area. Okay. So you've got. A-. Yeah. Those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard I would think. <SEP> Well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the inversion and Los Angeles and a- rest of California which is just terrible it sounds. Yeah. Denver's definitely. Yeah. That's one of the worst. <SEP> Sure. Yeah. Denver's that that real good e- that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does I guess. Uh-huh. Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the in the world for that. <SEP> Yeah. But I've been pretty lucky. I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh I'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida. And there you can tell that it's getting worse. I mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver. But you can. Yeah. There it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it. Exactly. <SEP> Yeah. And there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there. Uh-huh. There is. But it's kind of it's.
sw4151.txt:Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore? That's a good question. Uh there would be a point there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed. But uh since I've become a parent and since I've seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that. I really uh I I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment. Uh. Of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um I I like the statement made by Cuomo. Cuomo I believe is. Um he's he's governor of New York. But uh he's uh against the death penalty. But um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife. And that's. But but even even in that circumstan- in that uh uh situation he would b- he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh keep him from doing the doing the things. Oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response. Right. Exactly. <SEP> Uh a- and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question. And he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion uh a gut level reaction. Uh-huh. And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. Uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting peop- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill. Yeah. <SEP> I think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reason humane one. See I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do. Are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together. Or are they. Is it a penal institution? Is it is is it designed for punishment? Um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment. Uh perhaps not in the manner that we do it. But but it in in theory it fits in. In reforma- system in a reformatory I mean. If you if you put someone to death you obviously can't reform them. <SEP> That's true. So. Uh th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent. And I really don't uh agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well I was about to kill and dismember this person. But oh if they catch me they're going to kill me. So I better not do it. I I just don't think that uh that it works that way. Yeah. <SEP> I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. I mean people say that. But I mean if it was really a deterrent I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west you know. They saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. Uh-huh. And if we really w- if it was really seriously going to be a d- deterrent I would think that it would be public. I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it. If someone ever. If you know. Like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by a firing squad or something like that. I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here at the you know. <SEP> Well I I don't know if that would really work that way or not. Uh there's a lot of violence.
sw4022.txt:Well uh I don't know. I think the budget is really out of hand right now. And especially in this election year I think that uh there ought to be so- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It kind of seems to me that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's when it's just such a bad time for it. Right. Right. And uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts. Uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering. <SEP> Yeah. The ninety-seven cents a week. Yeah. Ninety-seven cents a week. Now what. That's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Another ninety-seven cents. Hell you can buy a coke or something for that. Yeah. I mean mostly it's it's not actually a a a cut. It's just a cut in the withhold in the amount withheld you know. Yeah. <SEP> Um yeah. I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot. That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either. Huh-uh. Uh I I haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either. Especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I mean you know in retrospect um was it was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know I'll I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes? I believe it was Dukakis. <SEP> It was Dukakis. Yeah. But I I can't. I have a lot of respect for him. Yeah. I mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said No. I will not. <SEP> Yeah. Read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know I I can't follow through on this. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it seems to me that uh that the budget is so out of hand. And especially now that they say Okay the cold war is over. And we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year. Uh-huh. Well I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go. Because in my opinion I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this peace so-called peace dividend. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. It's it's. I mean if they could actually put something together and make. I'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because I feel that they waste money also. Uh-huh. But with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh yeah. I uh I I think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where. Right. Ex- Exactly. <SEP> It wou- it wou- it would help unemployment greatly. And it. And in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country. <SEP> Yeah. Infra structure is in is in. I mean we we we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the cold war. Yeah. And and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least I feel unless we focus on the infra structure. And I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um yeah. I I agree totally. Um I mean this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen. Um I I'm in college right now. And. So am I. <SEP> Oh really. Where do you go? Uh I U. Right. I go to Georgia Tech um. Uh-huh. <SEP> And in. What. I had pol- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago. Uh-huh. And one of the things we discussed was you know where our where the budget situate- how the budget situation just got so out of hand. Right. <SEP> And essentially what happened was. I think it was like in the um tax year of eighty-one um. Ronald Reagan basically said you know I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the Congress would not in their right mind pass. Right. And Con- Congress realizing that they were going to lose a the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know bye-bye you know bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And you just. You you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington. <SEP> I mean it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun. Yeah. Uh well it's it's more than a loaded. It's a loaded cannon. I mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year. Yeah. And they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well yeah. Um what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're we're going to have to do some unpopular things I mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected. Oh no. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where people just want want to have you know whatever will make them feel good right now you know. For for the moment. And that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or you know it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference. Uh-huh. It. I mean I don't know. I I don't I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. No. No. Not at all. <SEP> I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive. No.
sw4177.txt:Hi. So do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have? Uh actually no. Because because I'm in school. I I kind of miss out on most of the current events. I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it. Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then? <SEP> Uh I don't watch a lot of it. But that's the on-. Basically that's my only major source of information. Um. What about what about you? Well I read uh. I get a bunch of different things. I get a newspaper every day. And I try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that. And I look through uh. I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I I pretty much read that cover to cover. And I as far as you know. That satisfies most of the short term news I get. Uh don't watch much T V. Don't have enough time. And uh don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know. They might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened. <SEP> Yeah. And that's about all I ever hear of it. Uh but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK. And for the longer term I I read uh like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and and uh READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they. The news isn't like immediate what you'd generally think of as news. But it's recent material. And it's more in depth. Yeah. It is it is more in depth less broad. Well actually it's probably isn't less broad. But it's just more in depth. And uh it is it is more sig- it is more just significant information you know. It is the big events not the little events. <SEP> Yeah. Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main you know. I know. Where they're just trying to fill in. Yes. Or they're making making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news. <SEP> Yeah. Uh I get kind of bored watching T V actually when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow. I know. I do I do too. And then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting. <SEP> Yeah. You may find one little uh news item interesting. So you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it. Yeah. That that's about what it ends up being. Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something. Yeah. Actually y- you mention NEWSWEEK. I I I do like uh U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. I don't get to read it as much as I like. But that's I think that's a good magazine. Yeah. I think they're about the same. I you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind. And uh uh what what kind of uh what kind of news normally interests you. I mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring? <SEP> Well right now trying to keep abreast of uh what's going on in Europe you know with all the U S S R's satellites breaking off trying to become independent and you know European community coming together. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's going to affect our uh economy quite a bit. I think it will. Uh they they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence. But we've yet to see it. And th-. It's real short term yet though. I mean it's only been three months or something like that since that happened. Oh yeah. So. <SEP> Yeah. But they like to tell us that it's going to be important. I'm I'm pretty sure it is because uh once once Europe becomes unified and uh their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be uh kind of hurting. I think it is too. <SEP> Yeah. I I think that's a possibility. Uh it we might also be helped though because it it will be easier to do business over there too. Yeah. Definitely. For the companies that already have a presence over there. And uh I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time. <SEP> Oh yeah. So they have a toe hold. I good toe hold. Yep. Because once you're in there then you can easily expand. But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult. <SEP> Yeah. Because when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist. So. Yes. Yeah. And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist. Even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist you know. <SEP> Yeah. Like England doesn't want to do one thing. And and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing. And they're they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet. Uh-huh. And some of it I mean is. I'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified. <SEP> Yeah. I I can understand their viewpoint. They're just they're starting off. Their economy's a little bit weak. So you want to get established before they com-. Uh-huh. Before they open up their borders to everyone. <SEP> Yeah. Totally. Uh what is the uh. Do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that? <SEP> Actually I'm not really into sports. My roommates are. So unfortunately I forced to watch quite a bit of sports. Against your will. <SEP> Yeah. We have to fight over the remote control. Yeah. At least you guys have a remote control. It's sometimes better to not have one of those. Course you can always mislocate it. Or misplace it I mean not mislocate it but misplace it. <SEP> And.
sw4129.txt:Okay. So what are what are your views on capital punishment? I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is. But on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain. You know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country. Yes. <SEP> And it's eating us alive budget wise. And uh. So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state? Yes. We do practice capital punishment. <SEP> But the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed. Yes. That's similar to Georgia. Yeah. And then I was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because I had forgotten I guess that I wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody th- than it does to keep them. Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know. That's probably true considering. <SEP> Yes. Yes. Uh I guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if. <SEP> Well I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. You know who would see it. Yes. Right. That would be the intent of it. <SEP> Yeah. But I'm not sure how successful that is. Well I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals. Quicker maybe. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. If if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment. Uh-huh. <SEP> What what kind of work do you do? Uh I'm a research engineer. I work uh f- with Georgia Tech. Um well see I'm a school principal. Um. <SEP> Elementary school. Yes. And in a very poor section of town with p- predominantly Anglo kids. And I see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do. Um. <SEP> And see I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that. I mean course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there. Uh-huh. But I think we would make a bigger investment in kids. We'd have fewer decisions to make. Down the road you know. Um that's probably true. But I guess there's other factors that. <SEP> Oh yeah. But p- p- pumping more money into the school system is a good thing. <SEP> Well I'm not talking about just in the school system. But it's not going to. Oh I see. <SEP> See I'm talking about. Like in in. Uh I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared. Uh I know the institutions don't work that well. But it's a bad day because I get all these kids through my office. I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids. Uh-huh. Five hundred of them are good solid kids. And I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day. Um. <SEP> And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible. Some of them in the penal system. So that's a difficult situation. And you know you just see those kids going down the road. Now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment. But some of them have already been in youth centers. And that kind of thing. Um. <SEP> And if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals. And I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system. I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action. Uh-huh. I think that's one reason we have problems in schools uh. And some of them are our problems. But a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do. Uh-huh. <SEP> But that's another subject. But. Well that's probably true. W-. Anyway I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has making a decision what to do with them. Um yeah. I guess that's not an easy solution. There's there's no easy solution for that. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't I don't know that there is an easy solution. But if you could find a way to prevent some of it and I'm not sure what it would be. It would be money better spent than. Uh-huh. <SEP> Do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard? That's true. I'm sure it is. Yeah. <SEP> Statistically that's true. Um yeah. I don't I don't. Certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems. Uh-huh. But. <SEP> Are you for it? Uh. I'm for it in in some cases. I guess I am for certain cri-. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. In certain crimes. <SEP> What kind of crimes would you d- use it for? Uh premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature I think should definitely. Uh-huh. Any mass murderer type individual. <SEP> I I would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going. You know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children. Um. Uh-huh. Well you always have castration. <SEP> Well you know somebody elected that recently. Yes. I read about that. And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh.
sw4103.txt:Uh the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and monthly budget. The only thing I do now is uh put the data into Quicken. I don't know if you are familiar with that. Yeah. I have some friends of mine who use Quicken. And uh I've considered using it once myself. But I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now. Um. I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then well uh uh not bother to total it. Uh-huh. And then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic. So it really helps with that. <SEP> Yeah. Well it's similar problems. But uh we just have the one check book. And we try to keep it up to date as much as possible. And occasionally we will get behind like you say. But uh it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced. Uh-huh. Well how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances? Well actually we haven't had to. Uh until just recently. I guess we've got a a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way. So we needed to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. We tried a way try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that. Yeah. Well that's pretty good if you can do that. I know. I have a daughter who's ten. And we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point. But uh we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college. Uh-huh. <SEP> So we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall. Um. And then the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund. Um. Sounds good. Yeah. I guess we're we're just at the point uh. My wife worked until we had a family. And then you know now we're just going on the one income. So it's a lot more interesting trying to uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to uh do it. You know kind of enforce the savings. Uh-huh. But uh it will be interesting to see. <SEP> Well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job well almost full time. Um. So it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing. Um. <SEP> That sounds good. But uh uh I was just curious what uh part of the country. Oh Stockton. Oh okay. <SEP> How about you? Uh Cincinnati actually. I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that. I don't know how many people are uh getting involved in this. But uh well that's interesting. Uh-huh. I'm uh uh actually uh I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading TELECOM DIGEST. Or was there another? <SEP> Uh a colleague of mine at uh work got some information over uh the computer network called INTERNET. Oh okay. Yeah. That is how I got it as well. But uh. And he just forwarded that on to me. And uh it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I sent back mail. Yeah. It will be interesting to see what It would be interesting to see how the data base. So well I guess we're talking about the experiment. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh probably need to try to get back on the topic. But uh it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures I guess you know. Uh-huh. We could talk about some of the long range goals. And. <SEP> Well what other long range goals do you have besides college? Uh well I think either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point. Uh-huh. Uh I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that. It seems like every year my employer just gives back you know a little bit your tuition reimbursement. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent. And now it's uh now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class. And uh it's a real shame from what we had before uh because we're.
sw4130.txt:So Julie how do you feel about AIDS research? I think we need we definitely need more of it definitely. I'd agree too. But I mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know uh you know. It would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research than a l- l- longer ago. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. For certain. You know because you know because uh the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients. Exactly. Uh-huh. <SEP> Exactly. Does does like d- do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover diseases like that? I think they cover AIDS. But what they do is uh if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they'll uh check to see if you're H I V positive. Uh-huh. And if you are not only will they not give you uh a policy. But they'll uh they have like. There's like you know a database of people that have tested positive. So you'll never be able to get insurance ever again. <SEP> Um well that's but that's why they should have s- started doing stuff before. I mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now. You know. Yeah. I think a lot of it was was just that you know becau- because of of the audi- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about. <SEP> Right. Right. That. <SEP> Right. And all these God-fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh yeah. One one one h- one humorous retort I heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know God's punishment was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people. <SEP> Uh. Yeah. But uh. <SEP> Boy. That's a good one. So uh. <SEP> Yes? Uh do you think d- you mean do you actually think we're doing enough right now to. No. I really don't. I did I did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff. And uh really we're not doing much at all. I mean most of what gets raised I mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by uh uh you know conscious yeah communities and things like that you know. Private organizations. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like uh San Francisco has a a real uh strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff. And and uh get they get donations from the community you know they're real And from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean it seems that you know it's just you know of it's just going to reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we'd nip it in the bud to q- quote Barney Fife. Right. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I I I don't know what the likelihood of that is. But I mean you know people really waking up. Uh-huh. <SEP> Especially with the ultra conservatives move our our political system s- sort of seems to be taking. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I would probably agree with that. <SEP> Yeah. So. Uh so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of uh people? God. That's a good question Fish. I don't know. Uh I think I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it's really it's really not necessary uh until until the disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely cut off from from the community. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that and uh I don't know. I guess I think that that uh research is I guess the most important just because I you know it it really needs to come to an end. You know. Uh-huh. I don't know. I don't know Fish. What do you think about that subject? I think it's I think it stands a really interesting question of uh.
sw4175.txt:I don't believe that we're. So what do you think about uh recycling programs in Atlanta Julie? The recycling program here is just terrible. I mean it's hard to find places to go. I mean Kroger does a couple things. They I don't think they do they do newspapers? <SEP> I don't know. There's there's big bins out there. I don't know if they ever get. I I really don't know what the details are. There should be someplace where you could call and find out. As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you. But I think there should be some kind of curbside service. Yeah. That's the only way I could really. The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff. <SEP> Uh-huh. They pick up everything. During the summers like the around where I live the uh homeless people see-. I mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff. Uh-huh. And so we used to just save them up. And then they'd come around. And we'd give them to them. Uh-huh. <SEP> But when. During the winter time I think they they move south or something. Yeah. So I don't do that anymore. And the the recycling at Georgia Tech like that uh outside the uh student center they never empty those things. Uh-huh. <SEP> I know it. I know it. They just overflow. It piles up. <SEP> So what's a guy to do? You know. I asked myself. <SEP> I just don't know. I just don't know. And now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center. You can't really unload all your stuff. <SEP> Really? Huh oh yeah. That's true. Hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient. Uh-huh. Inconvenient even. I know it. I know it. <SEP> But uh. So you do recycle don't you? Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm kind of I'm kind of bad about it. The. <SEP> If I if see a s- if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there. Uh-huh. But I don't really I don't ever take anything. Well I mean it's real. You ought to because the the the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything. <SEP> Uh-huh. And since we go there all the time I mean. But wait. Probably at all. <SEP> I've never seen you before. Who are you? Oh by the way may name's Julie. <SEP> Yeah. My name's Bill. Well. Hi. Hi. I'm from Atlanta. <SEP> Me too. Neat. Crazy. <SEP> Uh well is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie? I just think that everybody ought to do it. Do they do. Like what about like uh. What kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know? The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs. <SEP> Really? Yeah. What about like those grocery bags? Oh yeah. They have uh. Uh what I what I used to uh. Now that I don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot. But I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. A- but also most places like Big Star does. And I'm not sure if Kroger does or not. But. <SEP> They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic. Yeah. And they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in. Uh. Can bring them in. <SEP> Those petroleum products are going to kill us. I know it. I know it. The hostile planet I think Julie. <SEP> It really is a small hostile planet. <SEP> The petroleum pretty much I mean those petroleum products I think are the big uh you know the great Satan of the recycling. Did you know that. No. Really not. Did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper. <SEP> Um. Paper just seems so innocuous. Huh? <SEP> Paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know. Well it is it is though. It comes from trees. How can it be bad? It is because they. <SEP> They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it. Well they do treat paper with chemicals. Like yellow paper you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose. Yep. <SEP> Oh. You know you can bury a piece of yellow paper. It will still be there in a couple of weeks. Really? Yeah. <SEP> Huh. It will be whole. You'll be able to read off of it. I'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads then. <SEP> Yeah um. I'm glad you told me that because I use those at work where I work. And uh But I can just forget that from now on. <SEP> W-. I'm going u- I'm going to switch to the white ones. Well white paper's bad too. They they treat it too. <SEP> Well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bam- you know bamboo stuff from the from the banks of the Nile. I'm sure that's fine. I'm sure. <SEP> Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again. You think so? Maybe. <SEP> Tablets? Yeah. I think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether you know. You think? <SEP> I don't know. Well I mean I think we've kind of you know. What do you think? I mean everybody everybody everybody has a computer. <SEP> Kind of radical I know. But. We would no longer need paper at all. <SEP> That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist like uh Dick Tracy. <SEP> I would love that.
sw4074.txt:-kay Dave. What kind of pets do you have? Oh we have one rotten cat. One rotten cat. <SEP> Yeah. It's my son's cat. I heard a laugh in the background. Yeah. That's the boys. They know I don't like it. Don't you like cats? <SEP> Well I like cats. This this cat is a uh more like a dog. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's uh a one owner. He likes one boy in the family and that's about it. That's odd. How does he treat the other people? <SEP> Just uh stays away or runs usually. Wow. But he follows he'll follow my oldest son around. You know when he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap. But if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing. Did he raise him or something? <SEP> He's he we bought the cat for him. And so he's uh been the one that you know spent the most time with him. But I I've never owned a cat like that. I've had cats growing up all the time. And you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody. Uh-huh. <SEP> Huh that's interesting. So it's a weird cat. Huh. We have a a mutt. <SEP> A mutt. Well we we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from. Uh-huh. Uh some lady she uh. A lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house. <SEP> Oh. And she use to work for a veter- veterinarian. So she would spay- uh neuter them give them all their shots. Uh-huh. And we saw an ad saying it was free. So we went down there and picked it up. And it's been an excellent dog. But it's my first dog I've had. And we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work. <SEP> Uh-huh. So that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work. So that is that is that kind of your child right now? Uh yeah. Right now it it is. <SEP> You feel like. It's kind of good training. I mean we have been trying for kids. But right now we haven't had any. Oh uh-huh. But it's pretty good training I think really keeps her on her toes. <SEP> Have have you had dogs before? Uh my brother has. Uh we didn't do a lot with them. Uh I never felt like it was mine or anything. You couldn't do anything. Uh-huh. But I mean that did did more responsibility. When it's yours and not your brother's. <SEP> Yeah. But. Well I just uh we've you know. When I was growing up I had we always had a dog. And we had mostly mutts. Well not mutts but mixes you know like one or two mix. Uh-huh. <SEP> And those dogs always seem to be the best dogs. That's what we found. Ours is uh like a cockapoo. Uh-huh. I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it's a really good dog. Yeah. I don't know. They seem to be I mean listen better or something. <SEP> Uh-huh. Is your cat a purebred? No. No. It's just uh an accident. <SEP> From a frie- uh from my my son's friend down the street. They're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens. Uh-huh. And so. Would you ever want a dog in the family? <SEP> Uh we I would. We uh we had a dog that was a uh mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador. Uh-huh. And uh I should say a pup. And he was just too big for our kids when we got him. Oh yeah. <SEP> And we when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet. And it was a dog that we gotten. And he was he was just too big. Uh-huh. Uh the kids couldn't handle him. And I was still going to school. And my wife was working. And I was working. And so we just didn't have time to really train him. So he was kind of jus- you know he was too big for the kids to handle. So he was just tied up to a post. Oh yeah. <SEP> So we gave him to uh. I don't know if you've. There is a place out here uh called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville. Uh-huh. And they have uh. I guess it's kind of an animal shelter. But he just takes a few the animals in. And some he destroys. And some he keeps. Uh-huh. <SEP> So we took him up there. And he ended up keeping him. Uh cause he has had him for six or seven years. We we've saw him just about a year ago. And uh I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away. Uh-huh. And so we asked him about it one day. And he said yeah. He's been the best dog I've ever had in my life. Wow. <SEP> Just goes everywhere with him. I he would have been a great great dog. He just needed a lot of time.
sw4033.txt:So how do you get most of your current event information? Well see I'm going to school right now. And uh while I'm working I don't get a I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I don't watch T V as much really either because uh my free time is kind of. And I do like to do other stuff with it. Right. While I'm at work sometimes I on the computer network um I read the news sometimes. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's kind of helpful. I would imagine going to college though your professors and different things. You keep up on what's going on. That's true. I mean my roommates and stuff you know people around me talk about it. Yeah. <SEP> And the people I work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff. So. Right. Well I'm a housewife. I have three kids. And so um I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um talking with people and just hearing what's going on. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Do you watch do you watch the network like major network news. Or do you watch like the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR? Just the regular channel just channel eight. <SEP> Oh really. That's our channel here. That's the um eyewitness news. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. Oh ch- see channel where I am channel eight's um like public T V. So it's kind of different. Oh uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> I think I think the uh. I think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on. But um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news. Right. And I think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not. And basically you know if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will you know kind of publicize his name. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Exactly. I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on. Uh-huh. Because they can they can only report on I mean. They give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it. Right. <SEP> Right. And the news too it just doesn't um cover that many stories. I mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff. Yeah. But other than that you really don't know what's going on. <SEP> Yeah. Um I will read our current letters that come out on elections. And I guess I do read that. And I do study who's running in our area. And I do study what's going on in the economy. It you know. And I guess I do read other magazines um too to get my information. What kind of see. I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS. And that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of or like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that I wouldn't know about. Right. <SEP> But other than that I don't really read. I don't I don't really subscribe to anything else. I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST. Uh-huh. But um now I guess I just have friends that clip articles. Or if I you know am interested in something of course during the w- when we were in war I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on. <SEP> Oh yeah. But a lot of the times I you know I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper. But I just can't seem to find the time. Yeah. If they put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things. <SEP> Yeah. But. <SEP> Well I remember back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on because that they were going constantly with that stuff. Right. But uh. Well I um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of. And people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news. You know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas. <SEP> Yeah. That we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information. If they reported every if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour. Yeah. <SEP> But uh. Well I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics. Oh yeah. That's. They start already they're having like um. In the newspaper they have a section I think every now and then on the Olympics you know. And they've got like a countdown. It's like sixteen hundred days or something. I know we're trying to get tickets to it right now. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. That's going to be crazy that time of year here. <SEP> But uh. Yeah. I can't believe I mean. They're they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over. I guess people want to hear about it. Also big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh they're in you know tr- spring training or whatever. Right. Right. <SEP> And they did so well last year. Yeah. They spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports. And I think that um that's fine I would like to see more time spent on other things. Yeah. But. <SEP> It seems like. I don't know. They way they do the newscasts I wish they they kind of separated it you know. If you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it. But I don't have cable.
sw4158.txt:Um are you working right now? Uh yes. I am. I'm working in the computer science department here uh at C M U. Uh. <SEP> What kind of what kind of work do you do? Uh I'm doing basically system system design work and uh implementation work for the speech for the speech group uh here. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh. Wh-. Is that how you heard about this thing? <SEP> Yeah. Uh. Actually through electronic mail. Uh-huh. Me too. I work at uh the Georgia Tech Research Institute. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um I'm a co-op student. So I work and go to school about halftime. And uh I really don't have any job benefits to speak of. We're kind of um. I don't know. They just kind of forget us on that end. We don't really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really. So. Right. So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away at at this point. Exactly. <SEP> Exactly. Yeah. What about you? <SEP> Well um t- i- I'm research stuff here now. So what they they have uh um okay benefits package. It's not quite as good as industry. But one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um. And they pay for you know pay for the classes. Huh. So Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit. Yeah. <SEP> Uh they do that I think if you're uh research here. Then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters. And I think that um they might you know pay for that. Pay for the classes and stuff. Uh-huh. But I know they let you they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage. You know they'll let you work halftime if you want to if you want to finish. <SEP> If you want to do it quickly. You want to. Yeah. They'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if you want to get your masters. And then I think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due. So that will probably help out. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But Do you get any kind of health care type stuff? Yeah. Yeah. So I I don't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary. I'd you know I. <SEP> Yeah. We we do. We have to contribute a certain amount uh to it. Uh-huh. And it's kind of split between C M U and and you know the employee. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I think I mean that's pretty that's a pretty important uh part of it there because that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems. My dad I think my. I'm still covered on with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works. But it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own. <SEP> Right. Yeah. And it's also right now it's uh the. Like everywhere else uh. Here in Pittsburgh the health care uh rates are are going up pretty quickly. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's a whole other topic to begin with too. They have. But. Yeah. But it's you are right. I I I really agree that that that's pretty important. Well the only I think the I guess the only real um benefit I guess you could say working for me working here besides I mean. I'm learning and stuff because I'm at you know in school. <SEP> Right. But there's there's some weird law where uh uh student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh. Though that's about five percent right there. <SEP> Now that's a big win. So. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's. That's about the only real bonus. Yeah. I have so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid real you know because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to you know pay an extra five percent or so. <SEP> Yeah. I figured for. And they've just raised the um income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well. Huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well if you could call it a benefit that C M U I mean i-. The other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies. Oh yeah? <SEP> Um so that's that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> You know in case you know in case you ever need to bail out. Help a lot. Yeah. See around around here it's like uh. We pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors. <SEP> Uh-huh. There's not there is not a whole lot of you know funded research from.
sw4155.txt:Um what's our topic? Taxes. Taxes. <SEP> Do we pay too much? Right. Right. Um. Well do we? What do you do? <SEP> Um. I guess that. I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in. My tax bracket is is pretty high up there. I pay the I generally pay the maximum tax bracket. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I think that we're paying too much. Because I don't have any children. Right. And I pay a lot of property taxes. Oh sure. <SEP> I don't have any um I don't you know I don't use an awful lot of city services. It it you know it's like I have to work m- I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And um y- there's so many people who want a a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I just. Sometimes many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes. Right. How about you? Do you pay too much? Uh well no. I can't really complain. I'm a student um. And I d- I work as a co-op at uh Georgia Tech Research Institute. And uh I'm going to get back most of what I earned I mean most of what I pay in taxes. And uh and uh on- one of my parents is still claiming me. <SEP> Well when you when you go out into the uh when you go out into the working world it it changes quickly. Huh? Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm sure. Um you look at your paycheck. And you go oh my gosh where did it all go. <SEP> Um what kind of what kind of. Uh well have you pay a lot of in ta-. Have you been out working and then gone back to school. Or are you did you go directly from high school into into college? I went. Well I did work um just very for some time. But I didn't make enough money to really make too much of a difference. To worry about it. Right. <SEP> Have you have you been active in in politics trying to concerning this? Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that? No. No. I haven't. I uh I haven't done any of that type of work myself. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um but every once in a while when I hear up here at at uh in D C area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the Congress. Um Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there you know. There's a bank that they all bank with. And I guess it went defunct recently. Uh-huh. And one of the Congressmen has has written in the last three years al- about a thousand bad checks. Huh. <SEP> And we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho- all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule. Oh. Really? <SEP> And um it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to D C anyway. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur. Oh sure. Um I I I think we pay too much. And I've I look at my paycheck. And I make. Well let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think I pay forty-two percent. Wow. Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government. <SEP> And then they charge me sales tax. And they charge me gasoline taxes. Uh-huh. Taxes. And they charge me all these others. And it's just too expensive. Uh-huh. <SEP> I can't believe that. I I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for. Huh. You know what I mean? Yeah. <SEP> Do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government? No. No. I haven't. Uh I uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition. So uh I'm I haven't made use of that. What are you studying down there? Physics. <SEP> Physics. Uh-huh. Oh that sounds like a fun fun field. Everybody says that. <SEP> Scientific. Huh. Heavy science. <SEP> Are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that. Or is it more um applied physics? Um I haven't I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet. Actually um the the degree I'm getting is physics. There's a different one for applied physics. So I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied. Okay. <SEP> Well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's come rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward. I doubt about that. Are are is America I mean are we pretty pretty steep compared to most countries? <SEP> Actually I don't think we are. No. I don't think so either. Um like like Europe um England. I know the taxes are a lot higher. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> But they do have socialized medicine and things like that. Yeah. And um I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that um they're talking. Or maybe it was on the radi-.
sw4023.txt:How do you feel about crime in the city? You say you're from Atlanta. Right. I I I actually I live in the city. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I guess it is a concern of mine uh you know for my own safety. Uh-huh. I mean do you do you find crime in Atlanta really. I live in Atlanta also. Well that's right. Uh. Uh I think it is bad in certain areas. Uh. <SEP> However I think the area that I live in it's not uh the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city. Uh-huh. I think it seems that there's certain areas where uh the crime is focused uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city? Well I think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility. And uh they've had some impact but not a tremendous amount. Uh-huh. <SEP> And probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing I think. I probably agree with that. Yeah. Uh. <SEP> You know particularly in some of the housing projects uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused. Uh-huh. And they've got to do more than just having having cops there. They've got to kind of change the way people think about it. Yeah. That's probably true. Um so um well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities? <SEP> Um well I've been to. I'd say it's it's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime. Um it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example. Uh-huh. Probably not not as bad as Detroit. Uh-huh. I don't think it's as bad as L A either. <SEP> No. We I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have. Yeah. That seems to be true. Um yeah. If you've ever been to like New York City. And you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's that obvious. Yeah. I don't know. I came to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's going to just just keeping your senses about you and and trying not to look like a victim you know. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. You know walk bi- you know walk with you know with just walk in a confidently. With a big stick. Or. And you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are. <SEP> Right. Sure. <SEP> Right. Don't don't walk down a an alley. Or don't get. Yeah. Just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation. Uh-huh. <SEP> But yeah. There are times when you can't avoid all that. Uh. And and then you're kind of on your own. Yeah. Have you have you ever have you ever been mugged in Atlanta? <SEP> Uh no. The only thing I've ever had was I've had my wallet lifted. Uh-huh. But that was in a more of a a setting where there was a number of people around. And I kind of got. I was much younger at the time. Uh-huh. <SEP> And kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so I didn't know who had it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I've had that happen. But that's that's about it. Yeah. I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged. Um. Yeah. Oh yeah. I think I've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun. <SEP> Um. And that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta. Really. Well I've had my. And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed. <SEP> Uh-huh. I've had my car stolen. So maybe that counts. Oh really. Yeah. Oh where was where where was that? Was that downtown. Or. <SEP> Oh no. That was in the northern p- um up near Cumberland Mall area. Really. It's actually Cobb County. But it is Atlanta. Metropolitan. Yeah. <SEP> And uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area. Yeah. I've actually I've known known some people that have had their cars stolen. Uh and uh and you know about half the time they seem to the A P D seems to recover them you know in various states of disrepair. Up on blocks. Right. <SEP> Yeah. My friend had a V W Rabbit. And when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in the front seat. Yeah. Mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage. But they didn't they didn't strip it. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I got it back. Well you're probably luckier than. Yeah. Than most. Uh-huh. Um so like does insurance pay for the body damage. Or was that all there was body. <SEP> Right. It was about three grand to put everything together. They cracked the steering column of course to steal the car. <SEP> Yeah. You got to you crack the steering column. And you pull the. There's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars. Uh-huh. And you can start it up basically pretty easily. Uh-huh. So how do you know this much about um stealing cars? <SEP> Well after I found mine I had to I had this.
sw4079.txt:Okay. So Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have? Well uh I don't know that we really have a budget. I have a set amount that I that I save. Actually well actually there is a a way. Budget our money apparently. The. Uh my wife uh has so much uh gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks. And uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that. And besides that I uh you know I have a set amount that I save every month. Right. That's uh sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have. <SEP> Uh-huh. I am single. So. I guess I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget. Uh-huh. But I basically. <SEP> Really don't need to. Right. I don't need to. I am the only that I have to keep track of. So it makes it a little bit easier. That's right. Uh and also I you know I try to save a certain amount each month as well. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I try to try to have an idea of what my expenses are. And I am pretty consistent from month to month. Uh-huh. And uh whenever uh I need to uh whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it. <SEP> Right. Well I found that uh you know things as I have gotten older. I am in my fifties now. But before we use to have to have to have a very strict budget. I had four kids. And uh you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that. Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be. Uh I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside uh I kind of fence off areas of my check book. For instance there are certain things that I know come up uh every so often. Every six months I have to pay car insurance. Uh every six months I have to pay my taxes. So I take a set amount. Uh-huh. I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh uh saving in. And I also have got a checking account besides that. But what I do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out. And I put it in parenthesis. I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up. Uh-huh. <SEP> Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it. Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside. Right. And I guess that's a way of budgeting. Yeah. That's. I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More uh medium or longer range. I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for. Like I am. Probably within a year I would like to buy a new car. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I kind of have a an amount in my mind. And I am making every effort to to sal- put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too. Right. <SEP> Uh you know we've got two cars. My wife has a car. And I like to drive pick up truck. So we are on a schedule where I try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one. And you know I am constantly making car payments. But I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments. Uh-huh. So uh you know I get one paid for. And uh actually I am saving up for another one besides. So it's you know it's kind of a never ending thing. Huh. Right. <SEP> But you try to you try to schedule those things so that uh you only you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying. Right. <SEP> Have you thought about uh leasing? Well uh I have thought about it. But leasing wouldn't. You know I don't use it for my business. I see. <SEP> My wife uses hers just for pleasure. And I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away. Right. So. But if you are rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that. <SEP> Yeah. I guess. Uh. You know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off. <SEP> Uh-huh. Of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself. Right. Yeah. You're right. Uh I have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years. But I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill. And you got to put put stuff in them you know. That's right. Yeah. Mine's uh seven years old. And I think last year was that was a rough year for it. I had a number of expenses. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh I am hoping that most of them were just kind of. Uh you know the. As you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that. So I just went through that whole set last year. Uh-huh. I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again. <SEP> Those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in. Uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say. So that it doesn't uh kill you all in one month. Right. Right. What line of work are you in?
sw4152.txt:Well anyway I uh I uh oh. Yeah. I did forget to ask you. What is your name by the way? Uh I'm Ann. Oh you're Ann. Hi. But uh anyway I uh. Lot of lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject t- tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the. <SEP> Criminal courts? Yes. Yeah. Th- the one of which was uh something something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town. And that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race. Uh. Oh really? Yeah. Well they they uh the the people that. The uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel. <SEP> Uh-huh. And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact. I see. <SEP> I can't. I'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one. They have. They have. They moved it up to the county north of here. Oh. Um it's in Ventura. And there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously. And it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that. <SEP> Well that videotape was just horrible. Yeah. It was everywhere. Yes. So you know. And I I think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on. <SEP> Oh I agree with you. But I can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff. Exactly. You know um the you know. I I'm kind of torn on this issue. It's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true. But on the other hand it's it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict. Right. Uh you know they're not going to do their job. Which is. The whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough. <SEP> Exactly. Based on fact. Right. <SEP> How interesting. Oh. So what's the prevailing thought within the community? Um. I mean you know what the news media is going to make of it. But what about the community? They well. I guess it depends on who you talk to. I haven't talked to uh I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it. But I I rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it. And a lot of the usually fatalistic uh here we go again folks kind of stuff. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh my goodness. That can't be good for Los Angeles either. No. No. I you know. On on on one hand you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's sm- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy. Um. <SEP> Oh exactly. Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles. You're going to have it just about anywhere. Uh-huh. <SEP> There. Well. But that's that's interesting. Yeah. Um. <SEP> What about the judge who's hearing the case? Is he going to be impartial? Is he going to be a go- a good adjudicator? I don't know. You know. And and again there's something else tha- you know there was a uh something else along those lines. There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins. I don't know if it's it's got it's got as much notoriety. But it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the Rodney King problem. Um a girl walked into a Korean owned store. And uh they she had a dispute black girl. <SEP> Uh-huh. She she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store. The owner of the store popped her. Oh really? Yeah. And and oh of course they. You know the criminal case went up. And and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh uh practically a suspended sentence. I mean it was it was just. <SEP> Oh my goodness. She gave her no time in jail you know all of these things. And then oh there's we have these we have people wondering around to- with petitions trying to get the judge. To get that judge recalled I would think. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Huh. That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences. Yeah. It would make it would make life easier. It would. Yeah. <SEP> Uh. But. You would know the whole world would know what you were facing. And then it's a matter of of deciding.
sw4056.txt:Okay. Should begin. Okay. All right. Uh I can begin this um. Basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the the benefit program we have here is really quite good. I'm I'm pretty pleased with it. They cover uh just about everything vision dental medical. Uh-huh. Uh you name it. And for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much. So I'm pretty satisfied myself. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um what's your situation? I work for the University of New Hampshire. And uh our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in some ways. Uh you know. Oh. <SEP> Overall I'm satisfied with it. We don't have the vision care. We do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental. Uh-huh. Uh. Are you a professor there? <SEP> No. I work in I'm a on the professional administrative and technical staff. And I effectively I run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire. Oh I see. Okay. Uh so the uh the benefits. Uh probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time. Oh no doubt. <SEP> We get fifteen days a year sick time. And uh we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off. Right. Well that's good. Yeah. Yeah. That's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell is uh. I used to work with the Army Research Institute. And being a uh a government organization you got quite a few holidays off. <SEP> Right. But here you don't get that. You maybe get two or three a year. Uh-huh. So it's really. Unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time. <SEP> Uh-huh. So that's that's kind of a drawback I think. But uh. I don't know. What do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits? Well I think uh the the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know. Yeah. I'm I'm a little disturbed about that. But I think that's a national trend. And I don't know that uh I don't know what the solution is to it. It's bigger than just the benefits part. Yeah. I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night. They uh they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. It's kind of an interesting plan. It's kind of cold though. They've essentially made up a list of uh oh all the different uh medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff. <SEP> Oh yeah. About six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care. And the ones above would. Um. So it's kind of like drawing this line. And and if you have it great. If you don't you're kind of out of luck. <SEP> Uh-huh. But um it was kind of an interesting show. Um. I think you're right. I think health care is probably the the most pressing uh the pressing one. <SEP> Right. But I'll tell you I I don't mind having dental you know. Sometimes dental costs can be um just about as expensive if not more. And I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical. Uh-huh. But I'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more. I'm not sure. How how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it? <SEP> Well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending. And and the cost between them is very is very little. I think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan. Um. But it pays uh a substantial amount. I mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free. Great. <SEP> And uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses. Is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh professors and and also staff and administration. Is that generally across the board do you think. Or. Uh yes. It is. The benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. But the main. I think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan. But the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh okay. Uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's you know based on how long they've worked there. Right. <SEP> That determines how much uh vacation time they get. Yeah. I'm kind of interested because I'm actually that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to uh is to teach in a university. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now. Oh. But uh. Yeah. That's that's interesting. That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that. <SEP> College programs belong to this T I A A uh C R E F retirement fund. Oh is that right? Right. And in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh.
sw4181.txt:I don't think anybody pays too little. No. I would tend to agree very highly. I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it. Do you get hit up for local taxes there? <SEP> Yeah. We sure do. Here in Indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax. We pay five percent sales tax. Uh you name it they tax it. Oh so y- y- you get the whole smorgasbord. That's right. We. Well I I actually live in New Hampshire tax free or die. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Which is probably pretty nice. But I'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high. No. Actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either. There's no sales tax either? No. What there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything. <SEP> Uh-huh. The only problem is I work in Massachusetts. So they they hit me up for the five percent there. Right. <SEP> Taxachusetts. Yep. But it. Well you know we. It's only a state tax here no local. Uh-huh. We've got a five percent sales tax. <SEP> Right. But uh the problem is that so I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here. Right. But at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me. <SEP> Uh-huh. So that's not too bad. No. I uh I really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax. I worked in a factory uh last summer. And on the average I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes. And I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that. I mean I don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services. Of course I drive on the roads. And I you know went to the schools and stuff. But I really feel that that I'm just getting overtaxed. Oh I I mean I I'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on I mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know I actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year which was no fun. <SEP> Uh-huh. No. That's that's not any fun. <SEP> Right. And also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A which is taxes where you. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Most people forget about them because you've g- you know you can't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year. Right. But so you know and then you know like a five percent surtax I'm paying forty percent tax. <SEP> Yeah. Which is just outrageous. And a lot of it. And if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste. Yeah. Well I I mean I think there's some people there y- certainly are some things where you need infrastructure. And you need you n- you know. Right. There are things government does better you know. I think government does a better space program than you're going to get out of private individuals. <SEP> Right. But you know I think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way. Right. Or You know and and just tremendous amounts of you know. <SEP> That's right. Got to keep those farmers happy. So much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in into into programs that you know. Uh-huh. Yeah. They are they are a fat. You know I think the military is really fat. I think that a lot of the the H E W services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them. <SEP> Right. The- there is just way too much bureaucracy. And so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs. You know like we. Yeah. I mean we we spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals. And you know then you look at how well they're managed you know. I don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there. I think it's all going into into bureaucrats. <SEP> Right. And a lot of it's feeding that. Just I just I really especially in the election year I mean I'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole. It seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy uh the government goes and our our whole economy in general. And our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens. And especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures uh beyond what any other President since World War Two has done. And yet he supposedly. Well be- between him and Reagan. Yeah. <SEP> Right. Right. Yeah. The great communicator. I mean I just read something that two thirds or three quarters I'm not exactly sure of our national debt are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are suppo- supposedly fiscally conservative. Oh oh yeah. They think. <SEP> Oh yeah. And then they go and say I'm not c-. Congress they're the fault for it. Right. But you know the other thing is it's tricky though. Because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget. <SEP> Right. Well yeah. Then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire. Uh-huh. You lose. Grotten Connecticut goes. So you know it's like you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know. If the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load. And they're not contributing taxes. <SEP> That's right. So you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut. Yeah. It's really. That is the. Especially that defense cuts in the defense is really a Catch twenty-two double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great. <SEP> That's going to lower our national expenditures. But then you're going to have people on welfare. And they're not putting taxes in. Who aren't contributing. Right. Yeah. <SEP> So that's that's really. It's. And uh in our. I'm glad I'm not the one who has to come up with these policies. Right. <SEP> But what's very funny is in our town meeting they were v-. Th- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution d- for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. They say I want to pay for this and this and this and this and this. Course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use. That's right. Yeah.
sw4004.txt:How do you feel about the Viet Nam war? Huh well um you know I guess it's pretty deep feelings uh. I just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it GOOD MORNING VIET NAM. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh. Yeah. I saw that as well. Got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together the feelings. I really appreciated the the whole uh English class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do it you know. The guy's gouging gouging your eyes out. What are you going to do? Uh-huh. <SEP> You know what for him to finish me off. And uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of Asian philosophy that uh. Uh-huh. Well were you ever in Viet Nam. <SEP> Or. No. No. I was kind of an in-between uh finally drew a high draft number. And you? Um I was much too young. I was born in sixty-seven. So. <SEP> Oh. Um you know both my well both my brothers were um draft age. But neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for. Well I personally uh you know uh I just went in limbo. I had a passport and was ready to go or um out of the country or join special forces either one. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean I just didn't know. So uh. Well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there? Um yeah. Just a second. Okay. <SEP> Okay. Sure. Now. Well Mark um what was that again? Um do you think I mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it? No. Not not really. I totally agree with that. Um. <SEP> Um. What what effects do you think it's had on our country? Downside. Um uh well. The says we should uh go into the grief that that's there. And you know presidents have always avoided that as a country. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's pretty serious really you know. Lot of things that aren't being addressed. Uh-huh. I think you know that's pretty typical that of the entire entire involvement over that you know that nothing was really addressed. It was- it wasn't you know it was never. We we announced that we were going to war. It was such a gradual and subtle you know thi- um you know increasement of of force that. Yeah. <SEP> Gulf of Tonkin uh resolution. And was it a dolphin or a torpedo. You remember that? I vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something. Yeah. Yeah. Only only it was foggy. And finally President Johnson said well they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo. Oh. <SEP> Isn't that something? Uh-huh. Um. So um do do do you think that like uh um for example like in in this past war in the Persian Gulf war that uh that you see it seemed to me that that Bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um you know prepare the country for war. Uh-huh. <SEP> Hey Mark I've got to go um. Yeah. Okay. <SEP> We'll see you. I guess our five minutes are up according to me. Are they to you? Uh I wasn't really keeping count. But I guess. Good-bye. Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.
sw4092.txt:Music do you like? Uh lots of different kinds I guess. Uh I like country music of course. Uh-huh. <SEP> Texas. And I listen to Christian music a lot because there's a Christian music station here in in our city. So I listen to it quite a bit. Uh-huh. So. I am more into rock and roll myself. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I listen cause on Friday nights they have the uh they have what they call Saturday Night Alive. Or they have on Saturday night Friday night and Saturday night and they have Christian rock and roll. Uh-huh. So. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know they have that type of music. But they just have different words. So I listen to that too. Do you like any bluegrass? <SEP> Uh no. Not really. Huh-uh. Oh. And I like I like rap music. Well at least your. <SEP> Do you like rap music? Not really. Not really. <SEP> Well I can tell we're we're together here. Yeah. Okay. Uh. Um. <SEP> Uh we'll have to uh. What kind of. I have a lot of friends that like country music. <SEP> What kind of rock music do you listen to? Do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff. Or. No. I'm more into uh older rock like the psychedelic era like uh. Seventies and like that stuff. Se- late sixties seventies uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash. Yeah. I have friends that like that. What? <SEP> Yeah. So you have never heard of like the Christian music that I listen to probably. Oh I've heard a little bit of it. I've just. <SEP> Like have you heard of uh of Carmen? Have you ever heard of Kim? Uh now I've heard of Striper. So the only one I can. Striper. They're the really heavy yeah like the heavy metal stuff I guess. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh the first of Amy Grant before. <SEP> Yeah. Was you know became more mainstream top forty. Yeah. Cause she she plays both secular and Christian. So. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I like her too. Uh. I have been to a concert a couple of times of hers. I've never actually seen her in concert. I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show. <SEP> She does. Uh-huh. She's real good. She's real good. So I like her. Uh-huh. Uh. <SEP> I like some country music. It's just that I like finding a lot of it's. I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog left me everybody's left me. Yeah. <SEP> Mama got run over by the train. Yeah. I don't like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know I like Randy Travis. Uh-huh. You know I like more of the real new ones you know. Like Garth Brooks. <SEP> Garth Brooks oh. Yes. You know he's fine. Reba MacIntyre. Yeah. I like them. I don't care for the older you know like the dog left me stuff. You don't like Patsy Cline? <SEP> Huh? You don't like Patsy Cline. No. Huh-uh. I don't even really know who she is you know. <SEP> You know so. But have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like? That music that you like to. Uh yeah. Actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead about I guess about a week ago. But aren't they done with? I thought that they. No. They're they are still on tour. They have been touring since the late sixties. <SEP> And I just thought that they done broke up and left. No. <SEP> They're still together. They're still making albums. Huh. <SEP> Wow. I didn't know that. Uh-huh. Huh. Uh. <SEP> That's interesting. In fact I mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh. Cause they are on up there in age aren't they? Yeah. They're they're like late forties early fifties. But you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement. <SEP> Okay. Alright. You know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players. They keep on dying. And they keep on replacing them. And the new one's in this thirties you know. Uh. <SEP> Oh alright. But uh. Cause they look pretty rough. I mean I've seen like picture of them. And they just. Yeah. Well they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones. They just. I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured. But it looked like leather day at the geriatric. <SEP> Yeah. I mean cause they just. All their faces were just all shriveled. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yuck looking I mean. Uh-huh. Uh. I mean it just just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well are you into that that rock music you know all that druggy stuff and all that I mean? Well uh. <SEP> You know what I am saying. Like I mean like they come on the stage. And like you know you. They don't even know they are there. You know. They are just so out of it. Actually I prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just uh just so that you know that if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into lala land. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. So I just don't I just don't like you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> That. So I don't know. So uh have you seen any concerts lately? Um. Uh.
sw4055.txt:Okay Bill. Right? Yes. Okay Bill. Have you done much camping? <SEP> Uh yes. I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts. Uh-huh. And I camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend. And during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year. Oh well that that sounds good. <SEP> I'd say I camp quite a bit. Yeah. You do. Um now do you have a lot mountains. Well you don't have mountains in Texas do you. Where do you find places to camp? Well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping. Oh. <SEP> And we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us. Uh-huh. And so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the um sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again. <SEP> Oh. Oh my word. Well that sounds adventuresome. <SEP> How about yourself? Well um I've done oh I would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and I. Um we have five children. And so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves. So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out. And we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it. But we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains. Well that's good. And then the boys are our boys are old enough now. They're twelve and eleven. And so they're involved in the scouting. And they do a lot of camping with the scouts. <SEP> Uh-huh. And last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week. And so this year they'll both be going. And so that's been real enjoyable for them. Great. So. <SEP> What uh what kind of camping do they like best? Do they like it where they have tents. And uh do they cook on stoves? Um yes. They've well. No. Actually they've I remember they have taken the the du- the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire. And I don't think they've taken the stoves. Um last year they camped in tents. And this year I believe they will be in tents also. Uh-huh. Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> It doesn't get very cold in Texas. So lots of times we don't even take tents. Oh is that right? <SEP> We just use trail tarps. Oh and what does that consist of? Uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh like a uh. Oh. <SEP> Uh-huh. They're very light weight. And we use them when we go backpacking. So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh. They're not very heavy see. Uh-huh. <SEP> So you carry them with you. And they'll keep you dry or whatever. Oh. Yes. Well see when when we go camping here. We have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents. And I like to sleep on the air matresses. I'm not. My bones are getting so old. So I like to I like to sleep on the matresses. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that? Ye- yes. In fact uh um last month we went camping. We saw a lot of deer uh in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere. Oh. <SEP> My word. Gee. <SEP> Uh-huh. So uh but it even though uh it wasn't hunting season. And we were with Boy Scouts. So of course we don't uh want to go hunting. Uh-huh. <SEP> But we got to see a lot of deer um out and about. Oh. And there's. Of course we see smaller animals all the time. And uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because uh we have uh armadillos. Oh. <SEP> Do you know what armadillo is? Oh. Uh they're covered like with a heavy armor type stuff. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And possums and uh raccoons. My word. <SEP> And we have those creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a midnight snack. Uh-huh. And so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away. But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything. <SEP> They will if you attack them. Oh. But most time they run away from you if they if they see you're up you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep. Oh my word. <SEP> So. Well that sounds a little less fierce than bears. We we want to.
sw4149.txt:Wendy I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh. Right. Let me ask you the question. Do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to? <SEP> Right now I'm in college. And I'm on work study. Uh-huh. And so my budget comes from my dad's help. Uh-huh. <SEP> He helps me out a lot. And I get paid monthly. So that's kind of hard to have a budget. My mother uh doesn't get paid much money. So her budget is uh just uh planning for I R A's. I see. I see. Well good. I'm kind of in a different situation. But I I I went through that too when I was in school. But uh I was I was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that. But uh I'm married and have uh a a couple of children. And we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm on a salary. So I don't get any overtime or anything like that. But We have a fixed income. Oh. And we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have will is spent accordingly. And uh what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment. <SEP> Uh-huh. We have the insurance premiums uh utilities and so forth. And we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside. And we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll- the kids' education college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds. Uh-huh. And and we also set aside an emergency fund. Because we've uh we've been married for about ten years. <SEP> That sounds good. And we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh not enough to go and to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for. Right. <SEP> Right. And uh then we have you know. Whatever's left over is disposable in- disposable dis- yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month. So and it's worked out very well. It's uh it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that. <SEP> Well that's good. And nice thing about it I my wife is is excellent in that we both work together. We both have a budget. And we stick to it. Well good. And there's no surprises in that. <SEP> With two kids that could be hard. Well actually I have four kids. Four !. So. Yeah. I said a couple of kids. I I guess I should have specified. I have four four little boys. <SEP> Oh my goodness. Yeah. Four boys. You bet. <SEP> Oh my goodne-. You bet. It's just me and my sister. All right. <SEP> And my parents divorced three years ago. Uh-huh. And my sister had gotten through college. But I was still in high school. And my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together. Yes. <SEP> And then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college. Uh-huh. But uh when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house. Oh. <SEP> So now my dad's paying for all of my college of. Well good. Good. And financial aid and scholarships. Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm a music major. So I have auditions coming up. Yes. Well what year are you in in college? I'm a sophomore. You're a sophomore. So you have a few more years. <SEP> Right. Right. I'll I'll probably have about two two and a half years left. Uh-huh. Well good for you. Good for you. Yeah. I imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that during school and so it forth. Oh it sure is. I I know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks. Yes. <SEP> And I and I don't spend over that. Well great. Great. And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too. Oh sure. There's there's always music books to buy. Lab fees and all. <SEP> Oh yes. Oh yes. Well you're not a starving artist yet are you? Oh no. No. No. Good. <SEP> I don't plan on being a starving artist. Well good. That's why I'm in college. The- there's enough of those in the world huh? <SEP> Right. Good. Good. I'm glad to hear that Wendy. W-. That's usually because they're not real educated. They can't afford to have a really good job. Who's who's not very well educated? <SEP> The starving ones. Oh yes. Yes. There's enough out there that if you have if you're educated enough then you can make money. That's true. That's true. I found that out. <SEP> So that's why I'm planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also try and set that money aside. Right. <SEP> What did you major in? I majored in business administration. Well good. You know plenty about planning a b- a budget. Yeah. But uh once again.
sw4080.txt:Okay. All right. What's your view. <SEP> Huh? What's your view? Well I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. I mean. You know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know. <SEP> That's right. That's right. I don't know. Coming from Texas you're probably. I don't know. I shouldn't make stereo types. But gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think. Yeah. It is. But I'm not really from I'm not really from Texas. I just live down here now. I've I've lived down here a couple years. Oh you're just live down there? <SEP> Yeah. I'm originally from Colorado. But yeah. Oh well. <SEP> There uh there uh there's a lot of hunters here. Yeah. Well I know how you feel. I'm uh I grew up in Nebraska. And and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know. And man there's no way. There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons. Uh-huh. That's just. I don't know. <SEP> I just think I think it's ridiculous. Yeah. I mean. It doesn't sit with me very well. I don't know I anymore. I keep a thirty-eight in my truck you know. <SEP> Really. Yeah. I just about all. Well I live in Minneapolis. And I. Well actually I live in Florida. But I am staying in Minneapolis for a year. And you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And it's just you never know who is out there. Right. You know it's just for self protection purposes. And then of course there's the hunting issue. So. <SEP> Sure. Yeah. That's good. What do you do Jeff? Uh I I'm in uh program control for a company up here. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. All right. We do schedules for programs schedule programs. Yeah. <SEP> What do you do? I'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here. Oh okay. So uh. Yeah. You guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything. Or. <SEP> Uh I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here. I don't own a shotgun. But I'd like to go bird hunting. Yeah. You know that's something I miss quite a bit. So. <SEP> Yeah. Uh when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting you you know quite a bit. Yeah. But. Yeah. All right. Yeah. My brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit. But I don't know. I guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh for a complete. <SEP> One for a total ban and uh. That's right. I guess I am about eight or nine. <SEP> Yeah. I I agree with you there. Yeah. No doubt about it. But uh. I mean if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't. Yeah. <SEP> I you know I'm not for it. Yeah. If there's if there's a way you know to limited it to people that I don't know that. They I guess they passed a couple of uh uh laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then they actually uh. I know it's this way in Florida. They have a waiting period where you buy one. And that's a week. Uh-huh. And then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that. I think that's a pretty good idea. Uh and that's. I don't know. That's not a bad idea. But then again you can always get around that. You could go through the black market like you say. You know you always be able to get around. But uh. <SEP> Sure. Yeah. It's one of things. But uh I don't know. I guess I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon. Yeah. I don't either. Yeah. I'm just not. I think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway. <SEP> Yeah. I. There. Fully auto. But even well I mean a semiautomatic I guess that's. It kind of takes the sport out of hunting. <SEP> Yeah. Right. You know it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve. Sure. You know you might do the same thing. <SEP> Right. And so it's like I don't know. It does. It takes the sport out of it. For me I would much rather have a bow anytime. Oh really. I I like bows. You know I have done some bow hunting. And I uh I get into it. And I think it's more of a challenge you know. <SEP> Yeah. But uh I don't know. I guess it keeps the shell makers in business. Sure. But uh I don't know. Anyway that's about where I stand. <SEP> Me too. You uh. Yeah. I am about the same way. And you uh have you eaten yet or whatever. <SEP> Yeah. Is it seven o'clock there? Uh yeah. It's about seven fifteen. You guys central? <SEP> How is the weather up there? Oh it's not too good. It's kind of rainy actually. Is it? Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh I don't know ten or twenty degrees. <SEP> Right. And it's been up around forty. So people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature. Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that. So. Yeah. I am just up here for the year. And it's kind of shocking.
sw4159.txt:Okay. So uh Mike what are your opinions on uh trial by jury? Well I work for an insurance company. So I see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided. Um by juries particularly. And I know in England the judges set all of the awards. You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence. But then they leave the awards up to more learned people. And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars. Uh-huh. Yeah. That that seems to make sense. But leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the uh kind of the rate for different. <SEP> Oh exactly. Each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what um the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range. Uh-huh. When you get one way out like that. But then really doesn't pen- wind up penalizing the person that they went after. Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. If they get some of those mega awards against them. Right. <SEP> You know they're not going to sit there and lose money. If they are losing money then they're going to raise rates. Right. Th- they ha-. So it all comes filtering down to us all in- individually. Right. <SEP> And uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged you know. Well how do you feel about setting like well for example a car type accident where uh or some incident where someone loses a limb. Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm a dollar figure for losing different body parts? <SEP> I don't know. You know some of the health insurance is written that way. You know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s- pre specified in the policy so much. But I don't know that you can necessarily put a a value on somebody's limb uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases. Uh-huh. I think maybe you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with with that. I mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old. Huh. <SEP> I I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing. Uh-huh. And that can be part of continuing education maybe for judges. Yeah. <SEP> I don't know. Right. You know to get into the economics of things uh. Because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away. Yeah. <SEP> That's true. If it's a company you know that they're insured. Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages. Huh. <SEP> I think those should be uninsurable. I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage. Oh out of thei- r-. As opposed to the corporat- insurance paying the bills. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Well we're. <SEP> For for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens. One of their employees causes damage or something. Wh- Who who. Sure. That's what they buy insurance for. Do they get they get insured they get insured from other insurance companies. Or how does that work? <SEP> Well I was just talking about any company. Uh let's just say a lumber manufacturing company. Oh okay. You're talking about corpor-. And uh somebody is on the premises. Sure. <SEP> And one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift. And he pushes the wrong button. And he drops a load of lumber on somebody. And it injures them. Okay. Well. <SEP> Sure. Insurance should pay for that. But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings. Well I'm not talking about any loss. I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a l- usually a lot less. But it's an an amount they're designed to sting them a little for their negligence. For gross wanton negligence in a claim. That. <SEP> For oh th-. Uh-huh. <SEP> And unfortunately the ch- the. Lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too. Uh-huh. So again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong. Right. That will. <SEP> They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to. Huh. And if if they know some practice is wrong you know. I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences. I'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know. Maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there. And they continue to do it even after they become aware of that. Sure. <SEP> Okay. Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket.
sw4108.txt:Okay. Uh so what do you think uh about putting the elderly in a nursing home? Well I think that it it varies on on the individual basis. <SEP> Huh. Uh sometimes it is there is no alternative. Uh-huh. Uh you do not have uh uh family available or family that's uh. You may not even have family that is uh uh in you know who are around. <SEP> That's true. Yeah. So sometimes it's not an alternative. Huh. And I think uh but I think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time. Sometimes in a nursing home. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh especially if if it's after an acute illness. To get over a. Or to rehab after uh an illness. That's true. I never thought of that. Yeah. Sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time. <SEP> That's true. Until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with. Uh-huh. Because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to. <SEP> Yes. They really are. They don't like to keep them longer than a week. So so there is some good to it. <SEP> Yeah. Uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job. You know the fam- well the families do not necessarily uh know what to do with them. <SEP> What do you mean? And they don't want to take the responsibility. So they will put them in a nursing home. Yeah. That's true. So you see uh. There's both sides to it too. What do you think? <SEP> Yeah. And it depends on how how sick the person is too. What you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I would personally like it. If my parents were to get ill I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help. That's not always possible. That's true. <SEP> But uh to the best of my ability I'd like to do it until it gets impossible. I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to. It's there's not a choice it's because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. So that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it. <SEP> That's true. Yeah. So. But I think nursing homes can be good. It just depends on what kind they are. You know you need to check them out ahead of time. Yeah. And then there's also some that are set up for specialties. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I know some. Unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have I guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wonder or or uh confused or have some mental problem. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. That they're. And you need a special nursing home for that. You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around. Yeah. And you need people who are trained for that type of problem. <SEP> Right. Who know what they're doing with that. Yeah. So so there's different types of nursing homes I think. <SEP> Yeah. Well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it. And she really liked the idea of of moving there. She's not ill yet. Uh-huh. But uh she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years. And then she decided that uh she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden. She's very independent. So she's in this nursing home. It's out in the country. And uh she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook. Gives her a little bit of her own independence. <SEP> Uh-huh. But she still has uh a security there. Right. Some support. And then there's also uh sort of a wing for those people that do get sick. And what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now. And then so if she ever does become ill uh it will be like family around her. That's right. And I I've seen some of them like that too. <SEP> Yeah. And also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Sh-. So it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place. Uh-huh. <SEP> No. She loves it. She has a great social life. And she travels. And uh it's in in the very in the mountains. And it's beautiful. And uh I I hope that I have something like that when I get older. Yeah. I I think I think the uh I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the uh elderly uh person who's going in and the family that's going to be uh effec- effected by it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh definitely it's. And uh you know sometimes it can those choi- those choices can be made in advance. And sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're. <SEP> Right.
sw4090.txt:Okay Eric. Uh are you married. And do you have a family? Uh yes I am to uh both questions. Okay. And do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances. <SEP> Uh yeah. We do. We uh uh. Basically there's the you know the expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month. Uh-huh. And we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet. And uh whatever is left uh after that we you know we sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for. <SEP> Uh-huh. I see. Uh. <SEP> So what do you do? Well that's basically what we do. Uh about every every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget. And we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest. Uh-huh. And then we divvy them up between our four pay checks. I work part time at night. <SEP> Wow. And he works and my husband works full times days. And so we have four checks. But that works out nice because we get paid every week. And so that does help. Yeah. <SEP> That helps a lot. And then uh we don't have a lot ex- extra for extra spending. So it's pretty well ear marked. <SEP> Yeah. All allocated out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Every penny is ear marked. But uh it we have found that works the best. And and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up. In fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half. But and divide those up between all. Uh-huh. <SEP> All the checks. Yeah. And so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one. And then the next pay check we're real short. Or. Right. Yeah. We found that uh it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses. <SEP> That's true. We were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were uh spending uh money for things that you know. We kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it was easy to uh let things get out of hand. We thought it uh thought it to be really helpful. We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that. Yeah. <SEP> So. Well it helps you to focus where your money goes. Yeah. And and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget. But you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in. And then you're saying my word where did all that money go. <SEP> That's a lot of money. But. Where does it go? Yeah. Uh. <SEP> But. And also we have found that if we write down. And we did this. We are not real consistent with this. But we did it for about a month. And we wrote down everything that we bought when you know every pay check. Uh-huh. And so we could see where every penny went. And it was really interesting to see just what you do spend. And like I say we haven't been real consistent with it. It's. We should cause it does help. <SEP> Yeah. The other the other thing that that we've found that helps is you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit. Uh-huh. It's just to uh uh get up the money in advance and put it in uh uh so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in uh in an envelope or whatever. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount. And then once that was gone well if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say oh it's gone. Wel- just stick to that. Uh-huh. That is. <SEP> Yeah. That that sounds like a really good idea. <SEP> So. And it really helpful. Uh have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet? <SEP> We we haven't. We our our initial goal was just to retire debt uh completely retire debt for car payments and credit card uh credit card debt and all of that. Oh uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> We are just at a point where where we could start thinking about it. So. Oh that's good. That's a good feeling. Yeah. Well I. My husband just graduated from the university uh a year ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. So finally finally we are getting to that point too. A student. So are you still going to school. Or. <SEP> Yeah. I am actually in the in the mas-.
sw4099.txt:Kay. Okay. I guess we're talking about exercise huh? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well first of all I I ha- have to ask you how how old you are? Oh I am twenty-seven. Twenty-seven. Okay. Well I am quite a bit older than you are. <SEP> But no. I think exercise is extremely important. And I I do exercise on a regular basis. You do? What type of exercise do you do? Well I do uh jazzercise which is an aerobic uh program that. Oh you do. <SEP> Are you familiar with it? Yes. It's uh you know a national company. And we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long. So you can. Are they different from aerobics. Or is it the same thing? <SEP> No. It's really it's an aerobic routine. Yo- you warm up. And then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate. And then you gradually go down again. And you do that every day. Or. No. I only do it probably two or three times a week. Oh okay. <SEP> The minimum they want you to do is three times a week. And this is a club. Or uh do you belong to a group? Well it's really a. I mean it's called a center. And you buy as many classes as you want to at a time. And then you just go in whenever you can. So like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings. Do you go with friends. Or do you go alone? <SEP> No. I go by myself. And that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me. Yeah. And most of my friends that are my age don't exercise. Or they might play tennis. Uh-huh. <SEP> And since I am not a tennis player uh you know I don't get that. But I am you know I am between I am in my late forties. Uh-huh. So uh there aren't many people you know that want to do that. Oh. <SEP> Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. You know with with children between the ages. Oh yeah. Young mothers or. Young mothers. You know young women with small children are the ones that I find. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well what do you do? Uh I really don't have a routine. I like playing basketball. We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop. And that's what I do every day. <SEP> Oh great. Yeah. Do you play every day? Yeah. Pretty much. When my wife lets me. <SEP> Well now who do you play with? Do you have friends that play with you. Or just. No. I just shoot around by myself. Yeah. And uh that's about it. I use to play soccer a lot in high school. But when I graduated I haven't done much. I don't have a problem. I know I have to do more aerobics. But I don't have a problem with weight. I could eat all day and not gain an ounce. <SEP> Well see that's that's th- really good. And I think that keeps a lot some people from exercising. Uh-huh. I mean I don't have a problem with weight either. But I think I don't have a problem because I exercise. You know. You do exercise. <SEP> I mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin. And it's because I exercise. You do it. But I also watch what I eat. You know. Uh-huh. <SEP> But you'll come. Being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet. Yeah. And I. But as you get older you will. Well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days. But I don't know. <SEP> Well it might not. Mine. Because everybody's been telling me that too. And so far it hasn't happened you know. And I I just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I guess I enjoy sports a lot. So that's why I've kept active in that way. Yeah. But you don't play any other sports but basketball? Uh basketball. Volleyball uh. Too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby. I do that. <SEP> But do you ski? Being in Utah I was wondering if you ski. Uh I use to. But it got too expensive. So. Oh did it really? Yeah. <SEP> Cause I know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great. Yeah. A lot of people do that. Yeah. And but well I just I never find the time. I had rather do other things. <SEP> Yeah. Well I have never skied before. But I have friends that go to Utah all the time. And they think it's really. Oh they come up here. And they ski. I guess there's a place where you can ski. Well is it Tahoe? Where you ski from. No. That's Nevada to California I guess. That's in Nevada. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line. Oh yeah. But. <SEP> But there's a fun- there is a place in Utah called a funny name. There's Snow Bird or Alta. But it's like Oh Heavenly. Is that it? Heavenly? <SEP> Yeah. I think it's called Heavenly. Huh. I've never heard of that one. You've never heard of that? Huh-uh. <SEP> Well maybe it isn't in Utah. But they said they've skied Heavenly. And it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place. It's kind of funny. Do they exercise much or I mean for skiing? I know when I went you can get sore easily. But. <SEP> Oh yeah. You can get really sore. I know you. I mean I've talked to people. But most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore. Oh yeah. Is one or two timer a year if I do go on them. And I am really sore after. And then is it your quadriceps that are the worst? Yeah. <SEP> In your legs and. My legs really really ache. Yeah. Yeah. But that's. I am using muscles that I have never used before. <SEP> Well. And it's strange that you can do like I did aerobics you know all the time. And then I went horseback riding. And still I was so sore. And I couldn't get over.
sw4154.txt:Well what do you feel about the um present situation in the Mideast? Well it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is. Uh-huh. <SEP> What do you think Mark? Yeah. I agree. I think I think there's definitely been some changes um. And I think you know the the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on on the situation. Oh yeah. Um you know in that there's there's not you kno- there you know i- you know. Basically since the end of World War two there was always you know that little proxy war going on. You know with um the U S funding Israel and and the um Soviet Union funding the Arab countries. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much. Or supplied with arms the same way. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. But on the same token you know Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the U S in being you know the foothold of capitalism. You know in in the Mideast. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well I we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves. Uh-huh. You know we s- kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh Kuwait was uh the fact that they did not retaliate for the uh scud missiles that were uh launched there. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> That just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint. And it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the U S. Uh-huh. Yeah. But on the other hand you know if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes. I see. They basically would have you know had a had a f- they had they would have had had to fly through you know two enemies. <SEP> Oh you don't think they got the codes from the U S already? The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them. I see. I mean of course you know public statements can be taken for. <SEP> That's true. They can yet they. Uh-huh. Yeah. D-. <SEP> Well what do y-. What about this situation with the you know the uh continual uh harassment by Iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the uh arms inspectors have free access. Uh-huh. You know well to begin with you know. I pretty much question or what what the U S -s motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement. Uh-huh. Uh I. The cynical side of me says that you know it was more for uh the the domestic political situation than for anything else. You know and that you know and for portraying Bush is a strong President. <SEP> Huh yeah. Okay. Sure. Uh I mean I really I really think that that my gut feeling is that that you know he pretty much picked picked the fight with uh with um Hussein. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean I'm not not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to ge- enter that fight. Right. But you know I think I think that that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt. <SEP> Uh-huh. Where a lot w-. Well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh you know move on into Kuwait and see what happens? <SEP> I think I mean I thought I think that um in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen. Uh-huh. And I I really don't I really don't think that. I think I think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests. <SEP> Right. Um. Yeah. Well may have been. You know I'm not saying that that's not the case. Uh. Yeah. And I mean in in in along this line since since you know it it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting uh the Iraqis out of Kuwait. <SEP> Right. I just don't I just don't I I I d- I I I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle. No. Um you know over over the uh over over what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically. <SEP> No. It doesn't look like we're getting ready to do to do much more in there. Uh-huh. Even at this point. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Well what about uh. Do you have any any views on uh Israel's relation to the U S? Do you think we ought to you know back off on our support of the country. <SEP> Or what do yo-. Well I have I have very fixed feelings about Israel. Um I think that that for a long while we've we've had almost a you know ha- t-.
sw4123.txt:Jimmy so how do you get most of your news? Well I kind of uh I watch the uh national news every day for one. I also read one or two papers a day. And I'm a I'm pretty much a news junkie. And I tune in to C N N a lot. Oh wow. So when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when? <SEP> Uh every evening at six thirty I believe. I watch the national news. Oh okay. Well I would probably be a junkie or s- watch C N N a lot. But I don't uh I don't uh subscribe to cable be- because of the poor service and also uh because. Uh-huh. Well I uh I give to the United Way. And so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that. <SEP> Uh-huh. As opposed to paying for cable. Yeah. I take away a uh addiction. Oh something. <SEP> Yeah. Well I. Uh overall I I. The quality of the news you get o- off of most uh sources I would say is pretty low. It's. Usually you get pretty incomplete coverage. And that's one of the reasons where I why I try and get as many sources as possible. Because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on. You would hope. But still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is. Oh. <SEP> What what uh newspapers do you read? Well I read uh the local newspaper. And I also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that. Uh-huh. For a while there I I I uh subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES a- actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance. Well she was unemployed for a while. So she you know really needed to look at the the want- help wanted ads. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so often they they tr- the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspape- uh news. Right. And I don't know. NEW YORK TIMES is okay. But uh and when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so. But uh I mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes. Right. <SEP> Pretty low. But I don't know. Uh I think if you listen to like N P R or something like. <SEP> Right. I I really like N P R a lot. That's pretty good. Uh and I like listening to that on on uh. When I get a chance when I'm in the car a long enough time to to listen to it because I. Right. Yeah. I miss N P R a lot also. I really like them because they give uh. Instead of being as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which I think is good. Uh. <SEP> And they also. Their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing. Well McNeil Neil- and Lehrer. I guess he's leaving. One of them is leaving. Uh-huh. Uh they're they're pretty good too. Uh I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot right? <SEP> Right. Yeah. Had that invasion or whatever it is. Sure was. Uh but I I don't know. I guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype. Look at the the Smith trial. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean that was a joke. Yeah. That was. But then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was r- really good. Oh yeah. The N P R doing that. Yeah. I know. I had uh some visitor. And he was just in- just I don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly. <SEP> Uh-uh. Uh and I guess that's good when it's live if you if you'll really want that. But that's not really providing you news. Right. It's it's more like a media event rather than reporting. <SEP> Well but the but the ne- news news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C Span which I I tune into every once in a while. Oh really? That's kind of boring to me I think. <SEP> Yeah. It it is really kind of boring. But you know that's. If if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it. And that's what you're supposed you're supposed to. If you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own pinion opinion which I haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true. But one of the ways that I get information is uh every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this this thing. It's free inside the company. It's called INTELLECT. And and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really literally. I've I've actually read the actual articles. They're pretty g-.
sw4153.txt:Okay. Well um I used to work in a day care center. Uh-huh. I worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center. And it is they can be deceiving to people. I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got. And this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers all over you know the um city. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left. Yeah. So um I think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when they're not expecting it. <SEP> Yeah. Because they do do things differently when you're not around. So. Well that. I know wh-. The things that we kind of looked at is is you want to see how many teachers you have. And and how many kids they have and how they break it up. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in. Uh-huh. <SEP> It it was a really good one. And in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered. My wife did artwork for them. And then you know so we got our day care free. Uh-huh. But they didn't have enough teachers. And. Well this one was set up good. I mean they had two teachers to every room. Um sometimes three. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool. Uh-huh. The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough. They did not show them care to these small children who are being left. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um they. One time I picked up this little boy who was crying. And the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. You know. Huh. He said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up. <SEP> And I said no. This child was crying and needed some comfort you know. Yeah. What is your problem. So um. <SEP> Did did they separate them by age group? Yes. Because I'd think you know I think that's one thing that was important. Right. They did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room. <SEP> Uh-huh. Then they had like the um three three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives. You know just like that. Yeah. You know they really did separate them well. <SEP> I- it sound. Yeah. It was just the teachers themselves. It sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people. Affectionate people that they're they're kind of par- may be parents themselves or something. Right. <SEP> But. Yeah. That they're not. Yeah. Their system. <SEP> Right. But their but their system was was great. But um the you know the caring just wasn't there. Uh-huh. The one woman that taught that did the babies. I worked with her. And she was fabulous. <SEP> Uh-huh. She loved them babies. And she loved them and cared for them. But um every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and um you know would make me a nervous wreck. So you know. Yeah. I I I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff. But if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good. Yeah. These kids are just in a day care center all day and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care. <SEP> Yeah. They're just there. You know. Going through this routine which is lousy. Yeah. <SEP> An-. The other the other group that we had was kind of interesting. The other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we knew them from other associations. But uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one. And I think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know. But he was actually the more um the more uh what demonstrative type. The more loving. Uh-huh. He would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids. And and i- it was kind of interesting to see that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it. Uh-huh. <SEP> An-. Yeah. You don't see that much. Yeah. So they had a really nice balance. We liked that one. In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something. That's cute. <SEP> But they also did they also did some of the teaching things. And then they had um you know. Obedience obedience was important. Yeah. That has to be with a day care center. And you know so they you know they used uh oh I think they used the. You probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself. I've never heard of that. That's that's a new one on me. <SEP> And it's it's one. Uh I can't remember what they call it actually. But y- you just stand them in front of a clock. And you know it has a second-hand that goes around. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they have to stand there.
sw4104.txt:Anyway uh. How about you. What do you do with your budget? What do I do. Uh at the moment it's under chaos. Uh right now I'm just uh. I I don't really have a budget per se. I'm I uh it's called living within your means. You know which means at the moment paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. That's true. Uh but uh no. I don't really have a budget at the moment. Uh but I have uh I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month. And then I don't usually don't exceed that unless I unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if I have car expenses. And then that then it goes through the moon. So. <SEP> Yeah. That's sort of a problem. Yeah. So uh what do yo-. We're trying we're trying to uh. So far we are in the clear credit wise. But uh the other side of it is. So not much on that side of it to add to it. We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that. But. So you can afford to get a house? <SEP> Yeah. We'd like to do that some day. We have this dream. Yeah. <SEP> But we don't know how long it will be a dream. We we're kind of real we're real happy that we don't have any debt. But we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this uh economy right now. So we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month. Yeah. <SEP> So what do you and your husband do? We're missionaries actually. Are you really? <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. And uh it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota. Um. And it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here. No kidding. <SEP> And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home. I see. So. Overseas where would you be going? <SEP> Africa. Nigeria. Really. Yeah. Really. How long would you be there? <SEP> About four years. We're career. So we we go over seas for four years. And then we come back for a year. We go over four. We come back for a year. With with what Church? Uh we're with Wycliff Bible Translators. Oh yes. Yes. <SEP> So. I uh I know who they are. They uh they have an office uh in in Costa Mesa as I recall. Yeah. They could very well. And. There there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them. So uh are you uh are you uh active in translation? <SEP> Uh we will be. I was over over four years doing language surveying which is the first step. You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need. Uh-huh. And uh came home and got married. And we will go ba- back as translators cause we want to raise a family. And it is easier to raise a family as translators. Well I always wanted to do translation. But as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier. You know they really need surveyors cause you could you're free to travel anywhere. You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff. True. True enough. So uh what what uh what languages do you speak besides English of course? <SEP> Well I have a smattering of about ten different ones. But there's. I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other you know. Since I did you know complete a survey in one area I'd switch to the other. Uh-huh. So I know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff. <SEP> But in about uh about five I guess I can do better in it. And my French is pretty good. But it's uh French. So uh I'm terrified to speak in uh in France. In France. Yeah. Because they're real snobby about their language. And French is street French. And I just picked it up off the street. And I knew what I was I knew what I was communicating. But I didn't know what I was saying. I never sat there and got a direct translation. And said something here when I came home and French to somebody. And he paled and said uh I'm not going to tell you what you said. So since then I have refrained from speaking any French. <SEP> So. In. Uh. I don't know what I said to him. But uh I didn't ask him either. Must have been terrible. The uh. Was it Henry Macon said that the the uh language was like a man slowly bleeding to death. So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die. And I it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that. Free style English is just. Takes on.
sw4019.txt:Okay um Chuck do you have any pets there at your home? Yeah I do. And what kind do you have? <SEP> I've got a male Siamese about a year old here. I live alone in an apartment and uh except for the cat. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> How about you? Well we have a cat um. He's probably oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby. Uh-huh. Oh. Uh how's the disposition of your Siamese cat? <SEP> Well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature. Uh-huh. And uh he's been neutered and declawed. So he's an indoor cat. Uh-huh. <SEP> So uh that kind of calms him down for the most part. How about yours? Well yeah. He's uh he has been really aggressive uh especially towards my little girl for some reason. <SEP> Huh. He's uh been so mean to her. And and you say you've had him how long? We've had him for about two years. <SEP> Two years. And he was so mean to her um right after we first got him. So we had him neutered and and declawed. And now he bites her. He can't scratch her any more. Huh. He bites her. <SEP> Does he bite her enough to draw blood? Yeah. Yeah. He has a couple of times. So. Uh-huh. But he's a very possessive cat. He he loves my son. It's his cat. And he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him. <SEP> Yeah. And he's so funny. He just follows my son around just like a dog. Huh. He won't even let my son shower. <SEP> Yeah. He meows and wants to get in the bathroom. And while he showers it's so hilarious. So he's quite a animal. Yeah. Boy. I guess. Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right. Yeah. <SEP> You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something. Yeah. Well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sure. But uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit. And we do keep our daughter away from him. So. Yeah. Yeah. Were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house. <SEP> Is that the only pet that you have? It is. Uh-huh. We we tried a dog about four years ago and we ended up with uh oh malamute and some other kind of mix. Anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home. So we gave him up and tried. Well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh. Yes. Uh-huh. We're in a house. But we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog. <SEP> I see. We couldn't allow him to run free. So he was just chained up all the time. And it was it was unfortunate. Sure. So have you tried any other pets? <SEP> No. No. I I live alone in an apartment. And uh it's it's not that big that uh. Oh. Although I've heard rabbits are pretty good. Oh. <SEP> You know I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses. Uh-huh. Oh my word. <SEP> And they apparently uh. Especially when they're young when they bring them in. Oh my word. Uh. And do they they just paper train it or something? <SEP> I guess. I guess. Yeah. And I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either. Yeah. Well rabbits are darling. That would be fun if you could get them trained. Otherwise they're pretty smelly. <SEP> Yep. That's right. Oh. Did you see the the C N N the the dog show uh. Huh-uh. We don't have C we don't have cable. <SEP> I see. Well they have uh uh a Wesmin- they call it the Westminster Dog Show uh. I think it's in New York City at the at the Gardens. There once a year live. Oh. And they had that on last week. And that's really kind of something to watch uh. Oh. <SEP> It's on I think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two. Is that right? And some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there. Oh. <SEP> Some of them are really beautiful too. Uh-huh. So. Well I'd be interesting to watch. <SEP> So you live in Utah do you? Yes. Uh-huh. Elton. Goodness. We live out here by it's by Ogden. It's north of Salt Lake City Utah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we really love it out here. It's uh kind of country. We're we're only about ten minutes from Ogden. Uh-huh. So we're kind of country but not too. <SEP> Well do you all work for T I or for. No. Huh-uh. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh well see I'm getting so many calls to Texas. <SEP> This is the very first one I've I've talked to. Oh well great. Yeah. I've been doing it for about two weeks. And uh no my No my. Uh-huh.
sw4060.txt:Okay Karen. You- you're first. Okay. I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know not to get in like in a dead end job. Uh-huh. <SEP> And plus for me it's uh I mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental. Okay. They're also important. Yeah. I guess one of the differences I see is uh working for a university uh there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association. <SEP> Um. So there is a progressive path. But not being in the say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh like really. Um. <SEP> Are they like pretty much train for a specific job. And that what I hired for and then I just very little variation from that. Yeah. Somewhat that. But then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances. Uh-huh. Uh so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution. Uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business uh. But I agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the uh security aspect for long term employment uh. Well you know that's interesting though. Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore. I use to think that you know after you work. You mean security job security? Job security. Yes. <SEP> Uh that use to be I think a couple of years ago. But I don't know if it is so much anymore. In fact they we just had a lay off in what November I guess. Uh-huh. But uh it wasn't necessarily. I mean you know some people had been there a long time. Yeah. We are seeing that here as well. Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh so I I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in uh institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. No doubt. But. Yeah. Yeah. And institutionally like here at the university oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not where it necessarily where it's needed. It's where it's most expedient which Well in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles. <SEP> Expedient. Yeah. That's exactly it. Yeah. Where the most dollar where where you know it cuts back the most. Oh. <SEP> Oh. See yeah. So we. Yeah. I think that's one of the things too. You get too many management people you know. It's very easy. <SEP> Yeah. And it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know. Yeah. And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time. Well those people aren't there anymore. Right. Because it's support people that are providing the speed for it. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. But. So what else do you think is important? Well the uh. That's maybe the majority of the importance I guess. Yeah. Because my perspective is from an institution. Uh the there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But if you're in the corporate world I think there is considerable motivation for I guess in- innovation. Although he you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through. Uh-huh. But uh I think there is uh it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh things can happen much more quickly. And so you can see the reward of the efforts. <SEP> I think probably in a small. Yeah. I was going to say more it's more personal for one thing. You probably have a better team uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere. Right. Probably where as in a bigger corporation I think you're just a number you know. Yeah. You end up being your own person. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem. And you know you really. Uh-huh. <SEP> Whereas yeah in a smaller. I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished you know. Yeah. Yeah. It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves. Uh-huh.
sw4032.txt:Okay. Martin do you do any exercise? Yes. I do. Uh I like to uh play basketball and weight lifting. Those are probably the two main things I like to do. Uh-huh. Um so those are more or less indoor sports. How's the weather out there in Georgia? <SEP> Yeah. Um in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis. Um I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall. Uh-huh. <SEP> But in the winter it gets pretty cold. Oh. Um yeah. So it's mostly indoor sports I think in the winter. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um how about yourself? Well yeah. I'm on a exercise program. I'm riding my Aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning. Uh-huh. And I'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning. And I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time. It's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Do you do uh any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise? No. Huh-uh. I first of all I'd like to get my weight off. I'm about fifty pounds overweight. And so I'd like to get the weight off. And then I'd really like to get into that. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh we have a my husband and I have a a aerobic video that's called The Firm. I don't know if you've heard of it. But it's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down. But you're using weights. And that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done. It's it's really fun. Huh. <SEP> Yes. It's it's it's aero- it's similar to aerobics with weights. Yes. Uh-huh. But it's like low impact aerobics just with weights. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yes. Okay. Are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics? Um no. I mean yes. I am. But I have never done it myself. Have you done that? <SEP> Uh yes. I have. In in Atlanta that's um. Most of the health clubs are all. Oh. That's the that's the in thing. That's the big thing huh? <SEP> At first it was just regular aerobics. But now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over. Oh. So how is that? <SEP> Um it they call it a low impact aerobics. And it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time. Oh. And from when I've done it it does give you a good a real good workout. <SEP> But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know that and movement of going up on the step you know that could create a problem. Oh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. They they seem to think that it it won't. But you never know. Now if um playing basketball are you knees. Do you have healthy knees? <SEP> Yeah. I I think my ankles probably are my main weak point. Oh dear. But I've I've kind of taken care of that. I wear high tops and then also an an- a support ankle brace which is very stiff. Uh-huh. <SEP> And um we- wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so. Oh that's good. Well that sounds you sound just like my husband. He he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball. Yeah. And oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy. <SEP> Yeah. I. So that's what he does. He wears his his brace and his high tops. And. Uh-huh. Yeah. I did I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy. Oh. <SEP> Oh. I mean it would only take three or four days. And I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way. Wow. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh dear. Oh. <SEP> But um so how how successful is your exercise video? It is amazing how fast you take off the inches. Uh-huh. And I would once I start my forty- I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week. And then every other day I'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it is really amazing how fast the inches come off. And the muscle builds real fast. Uh-huh. Um you can start. They recommend doing the video without weights for the first month. And then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty-five pound dumbbells. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video. And it's a hour long video. So. So it's a good workout. It is. Yeah. I really enjoy that. So I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy. <SEP> Uh-huh. So in the winter I guess there's a lot of. It's quite cold and snow. Yes. <SEP> Yes. Now this one has been quite mild. Um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground. It was quite chilly. But not.
sw4174.txt:Okay. Okay. Well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college. Uh-huh. <SEP> She's actually at Bible College for this current year. Uh-huh. And uh I guess uh first and foremost it really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program. And then it comes down to the dollar. You have to uh. It's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction. Or you know it does. Uh-huh. <SEP> It comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to. Damn it I agree with pretty much with everything you've said. Uh the one the one thing that I you know I'd advise any parent uh you know or any or any person looking for a college uh is that I think I think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there. Because you know they're just uh in my experience. I've talked to people at other colleges uh that you know. The the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the cat- catalogs isn't always the whole story. No. Y-. The the college. The the catalogs are sales material. Uh-huh. <SEP> It doesn't matter whether you know they're they're selling school. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh and true. It uh really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school. Uh-huh. Uh I guess there's a difference in. Here the. At least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students. <SEP> Like they just live in the community. Uh-huh. Uh you know I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit. Uh-huh. Yeah. I I go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh you know I think I really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's there's not the the you know. It tends to be a very conservative school. And there and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have. Yeah. Uh I guess we're here. This is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh on a small quantity of gas. Our engineering students. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh in competitions. And that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school. Uh-huh. Uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a a spirit of somewhat unkind but producing graduates. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Uh you know as sort of some development and some training uh. Like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to how you know what the attitude towards achievement is. Uh-huh. Uh do you uh have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh feed information to? I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that. Yeah. Uh I don't really know of anyone that's like look- that's looking for colleges now you know because it with the exception of uh people's younger brothers and sisters. Then the only advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech. <SEP> Uh but uh no. Actua- actually I'm I'm I'm more interested in in in choosing the right j- job when you graduate type information. Right. <SEP> Well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh you know to. Going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on the p- pa- programs person's involved in. Program. And after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself. Uh-huh. <SEP> And if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market. Uh-uh. Jeez. If that's. Uh-huh. Like a fine arts education. I. <SEP> Right. Best training in the world is not going to f- put food on your table. Uh-huh. But uh.
sw4051.txt:Okay. You want to start? Yeah. I might as well. Uh one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh uh issue. Uh I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- different types of freons. And that uh rather bothers me that uh I was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's stuff we never even thought about three years ago. <SEP> Right. Right. And one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive. Uh they could be made uh you know inexpensive and lots of it uh. And in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work. Um. So. Have they stopped that practice now? <SEP> Well course there's a a tremendous number of refrigerators and fre- excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve. And of course the new cars I guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems. But uh there's you know the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera. Yeah. And that's got me very you know highly concerned that uh that's going to be quite a while before we can uh undo this. <SEP> Now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession. But you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion. So so I see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting uh compound. Oh yeah. <SEP> Because as I say there's a there's a tremen-. Well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator. And then do you know that number and then how many a a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> I mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks. And uh the only reason I didn't uh get into that more when I was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree. Uh-huh. And I mean. <SEP> So uh that's why I stayed in stayed more towar- towards uh uh. And that's a pollut- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with with water and uh really make uh make a mess. Um yeah. Yeah. I hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that's putting out a lot of dark smoke. Uh-huh. And I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars. <SEP> Right. But that that particular bothers me. Well most most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the busses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Because when you when diesel is burned it's it. You know diesel fuel is burned in a in the diesel engine. It's burned so completely that you don't have any uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is uh is not very volatile. You know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone. Oh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily. And it's got. Well you know its latent heat is high. But it's slow burning at at uh normal pressures. That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio. Oh I see. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so if the car sucks in uh fifty degrees.
sw4049.txt:Well uh I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing. Well. Um I don't really think that it's uh too many. I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us. I really don't see that that's a very very valid uh thing for a company to say. And I personally I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body. <SEP> Yeah. Uh I guess I basically agree that uh. Do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs? I mean suppose they found out some other way? Well I think I think we I think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs. Yeah. There's too many cases where it can you know. There can be false positive results and that that sort of thing. I don't think there's any definitive you know. Okay this person is taking drugs. So we don't want him here. <SEP> Yeah. Uh like I said some industries though I think it'd be very necessary. I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane. Yeah. But uh I I just I find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal. I mean if your employer's not going to trust you. Or you know it. I just I think it's a whole trust issue. I just can't see it. <SEP> But have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested. Or. Uh yeah. I have been. Yeah. I. I mean I was very offended by by the whole process. <SEP> I once too. So. Yeah. I mean it's very humiliating. And I mean I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs. But I uh I am totally against that sort of a uh. I mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you. <SEP> Yeah. I had it during a job interview. And I just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them to do this. Right. And I'm just like well uh I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me. Yeah. <SEP> Right. Right. That's that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just you know. I did I I was in the same sort of situation as. It was a job interview. And then you had a physical where you were drug tested. And it's. I just. And I know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know. I really. The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid. And I don't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work. I mean during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there I think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not. But when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work I find that to be fairly offensive also. Yeah. Well like you say I mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing I mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors. Right. <SEP> Right. And I mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons. That's exactly right. <SEP> Yeah. And also I just think it it gets a lot. I'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies. And I think that it just moves down along a line that that I really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work you know. There's already talk of people. Well we're not going to hire you if you smoke. Well you know I I can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke. But when somebody leaves work I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all. <SEP> Well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this. Or. Uh I really think it should be except as I've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times. Yeah. And other than that I think I do not think it should be allowable. I think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that. It should it's kind of the big brother syndrome. I mean I just. Anything like that just kind of scares me. <SEP> I tend to to view it. Even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that I sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an in- uh in addition to an individual's rights. But an employer really I think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to. Right. And if they say they don't want smokers I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that. Right. <SEP> Uh and I don't really.
sw4184.txt:You have any pets? Do I have pets? Yeah. <SEP> Yes. I have a cat. And I have two dogs. Two dogs. What kind? I have a Schnauzer. And I have a Sheltie. Schnauzers. Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer? <SEP> It it's a miniature. Uh. I'm going into all this because I used to w- I just got done working at a pet shop actually. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. Well the Schnauzer I'm I'm watching for one of uh the managers where I work. And he's been transferred to Germany for a while. Uh. <SEP> And I'm taking care of his dog. And uh and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that. And he says well my dog doesn't like cats. And I said well we won't tell him it's a c- we won't tell her it's a cat because it was a kitten. <SEP> And you know they just they just love kittens. Yeah. They just are fascinated. Oh yeah. <SEP> So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet. That's good. They say. <SEP> And they get along real good. I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip. So that was interesting. Didn't expect that would happen. Yeah. That's cool. That's nice. Uh let's see. What was the other dog you had? <SEP> It's a sheltie. Oh a sheltie. She's real s- sweet little dog. She's got a very nice temperament. Uh they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer. Yeah. <SEP> You know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive. They can be nippy. Uh-huh. Yeah. Shelties are nice. Everybody seems to be really happy with them. They're good temperament. <SEP> They're a good temperament. They put up with a lot. And they and they just uh. They. I think they have a good head on their shoulders. I think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that I have encountered. Schnauzers in particular probably. <SEP> Well yeah. But also some poodles uh. Oh yeah. <SEP> They're kind of. There are some smart ones out there. But there's some also some uh not so smart ones. Yeah. I g-. It seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are. Yeah. That's that's maybe that's there's uh some credence in that statement. Yeah. The- they're bred down so much. It's. <SEP> Uh-huh. They aren't the best pets. I I'd I really don't know what the best pet is. Yeah. <SEP> I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal. Yeah. I mean some people seem fairly well suited for for uh miniature poodles and such. Um And bull dogs. <SEP> But I don't know about these uh these uh uh these pincers these now what are they called. Pit bulls pit bulls that are so vicious. Pit bull. <SEP> They might. They're actually very friendly dogs. Are they really? I don't think I've ever seen one. Uh they're really nice. <SEP> I I've dealt with quite a few of them. People uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like they uh fit collars and stuff on them. And they are they are just really nice really friendly uh kind of like medium intelligence. Uh. Well how do they become s-. W-. How did they get their reputation then? Well because some people uh want to train them as. <SEP> Oh they train them to be that way then. Yeah. Oh okay. You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. It takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond. Oh dear. So the the poor animal is doing it in self protection. <SEP> Right. Oh dear. Yeah. They aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters. They are very determined critters. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so once you get them going it's not good to to deal with but they I I really like them. I was I was impressed by them. They're they're real sturdy little critters. And they aren't that big. And uh just really friendly. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well that's unusual. I was I was overwhelmed. I. <SEP> Huh well I suppose you were surprised. Yeah. <SEP> After the reputation that you know. Yeah. Right now. They have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know. They picked up a lot of bad press lately. <SEP> Yeah. They're banned from in some areas I understand. Well yeah. Uh-huh. But any any any pet's going to can can be bad if you train it to be that way. <SEP> You know that. They must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're going. Well yeah. It's when. In my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a k- a child in a house. Oh okay. <SEP> Oh okay. Uh-huh. I mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret. The the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know they should expect something like that to happen. And so bas-. Now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town. Oh did it attack the child then? Yeah. It it bit him. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that was that was not a good thing. But I think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was f- it was a fairly wild ferret. Well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that. Hadn't they hadn't. <SEP> Yeah. I mean they really should have should have expected it. And taken the precautions. <SEP> Um. Sure. They didn't. Yeah. It's too bad it happened though. <SEP> Yeah. Because then the the animal's in trouble and not the person. Right.
sw4013.txt:Okay. So you have eight children. Um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together. Oh we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling uh going to the park um some time watching V C R movies um generally cheap things. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. We know how that goes. Uh with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation. <SEP> That's right. Well that's fun. So um let's see uh. Some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot. And you may think this is funny. But one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek. And we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark in our house. Yeah. And that is so fun. The kids just get a crack out of that. Um we like we do like to go to the park too you uh like your family. Um we don't do a lot of vacationing. Have you taken a lot of vacations together. Or. <SEP> Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa. Uh-huh. And whe-. We get an occasional one or two day thing. Oh. <SEP> But most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa. Oh now where do they live? In Arizona. Oh so that's a bit of a drive for you there. <SEP> Yes. Oh so you like to go there for the holidays. And. Oh we don't go very often for holidays. Generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. Uh what are the ages of your kids then? They range from twenty-four to five. Oh yeah. So you have some in the nest and some out huh. <SEP> That's right. How old are your children? We have. Ours start at twelve. And then they go down to four. <SEP> I think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have you know. I bet. Yeah. Like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> But the young kids don't understand it. Yes. Uh-huh. And so they get real frustrated when we try to do that. And. Yes. And then if you want to play something on the little kids' level then the older kids get real bored. And they want to do something else. So. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I can I can relate to that. Um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one? I think it's improving actually. Uh-huh. <SEP> We had an interesting experience the other day. We we have pretty much a a routine that we spend. We don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday. Uh-huh. And we just kind of keep them at home. Uh-huh. <SEP> And our next door neighbor uh. We were at a soccer game Saturday. And our next door neighbor was there. And somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house. Uh-huh. And she said no Sunday's our family day. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them. That's good. And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now. Oh good. <SEP> I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction. Uh-huh. And I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now. I think so. And I feel like you know like President Bush Bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation. And it does begin with the families at home. <SEP> Yeah. And so I I'm a firm believer in that too. I think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something. So. Yes. That's that's true. Well we see that a lot out here in Utah. And um hopefully hopefully it's going to spread huh. <SEP> Utah's a lot better than Texas. Oh. Um do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas. Or. Very few. Very few. You feel like you're in the minority? <SEP> Oh definitely. When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense. Oh dear. <SEP> But uh. Well out here in Utah five is about the the average. Average. Yeah. <SEP> My wife and I were in Utah until I guess we were about twenty-four. Oh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Never been back since then. But We have kids up there now. Oh. So we get up occasionally. Oh. Oh I have some relatives out there in Texas. In fact my mom's out there in Texas right now in Dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch. And. <SEP> Where where in Dallas? Well uh no. I'm trying Aberdeen? Huh. Is is that close to Dallas? <SEP> I don't have any idea. I've never heard of it. Oh. Must be a little town. Don't you. <SEP> It's I guess it's out there clear out. They have a ranch that has like five hundred acres. And. Yeah.
sw4133.txt:So uh you know my feeling is that uh it's really being used today. It it you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal. Right. I think I've seen some statistics that say that uh it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. Right. Because y- you you've got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses. <SEP> Right. Uh and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. Uh for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the c- crimes that would be eligible you know really care. Well that's. Committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment. Or they think they're not going to get caught. Or. Right. I mean it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know. I'm invulnerable. I don't need to care about this. You know I I I'm never going to get caught. <SEP> Yeah. B-. Yeah. But you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh Jeffrey Dahlmer. Do you want. By putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again. Yeah. One one way or another. <SEP> Whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility. Yeah. But but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself. <SEP> Yeah. I don't think he could ever redeem himself. But in some cases yes. Well You know so that you know. The the question is you know the other qu- problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent you know? There are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops. I'm sorry. Guess we killed the wrong guy. <SEP> Yeah. It's it's. Yeah. Once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it. Right. You you can apologize nicely. But you know you know I think you know the the price you know. It I've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned. I think i- is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a-. The benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused. Yeah. And you know the I I think that you know. And the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush is you know. Well where are we going to impose d- you know. It's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in. Tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer. <SEP> Right. And again I don't thing these people care. They risk their lives every day. Yeah. And there there they seem that the profit marg- uh drug dealers the profit margin's so high that yeah the the risk is almost not there. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And and you know uh especially now I live in in Massachusetts you know. W- w- we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something. Yeah. So you know. But you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like Texas or someplace that does you know it it it's impossible to make a case that it's it's affecting it in any way. <SEP> Yeah. I think it's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it. Yeah. Well it's also. Because you know. <SEP> I used to live in Georgia. And you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment. But if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related. Oh yeah. It's mainl- lot of blacks. Also a lot of young people. You know a a a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen. <SEP> Right. And you know I I think when you listen to like the uh the the victims' families and things they're always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like they've gotten something out of it. I mean my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the uh the victim's family. The only thing that should really I mean. Obviously if someone of mine who has close died I'd probably feel differently. But you know th- you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society. Right. <SEP> Right. And that. And you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution. Right. I mean the. You you will work your prison job. And any money you earn will go to the victim's family. Right. And the the other thing is that you know I was reading through a book on uh geneo human geneo research. <SEP> Uh-huh. And there more and more things like schizophrenia. And why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin. Right. So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance. And you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. You really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions. Yeah. Well I I think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions. I never like the uh the defense Well I never liked the uh insanity defense. Society made me do it. <SEP> Yeah.
sw4171.txt:So uh do you happen to be working for a large firm? Well it's about three hundred and fifty people. I guess that's not large compared to some. But it's big enough. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they have a they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything. And I wish they did. Yeah. You know they have a four O one K. But I put all the money into it. Uh-huh. <SEP> They don't add anything. What about you? Uh I work for a fairly large company. It's got eight thousand people. Uh-huh. And uh we do have health insurance. We don't have four O k- one K plan stuff like that. But we do have like retirement. They kind of match up to you. If you put six percent they match up to six percent. And then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that. <SEP> Oh that's a pretty good deal. It's not bad. Now how long does it take for your contribution to vest? God I don't know. It's probably a long time. I'm sure it's not till like twenty-five years thirty years. <SEP> Yeah. The place I work at's health insurance is kind of expensive. It's like hundred bucks a a month or something for a family. Yeah. Huh well I guess what we have is like a f- what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars. And then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need. Otherwise you can uh guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money you know put in your paycheck. <SEP> Yeah. We have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh they'll basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses. I can send in a uh can send in a request for payment. And they'll uh and they'll send me you know a check for the amount they withheld. That's pretty good you know. It's uh it saves a third off on taxes or something. Yeah. Well it depends on which company you work for. I know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you uh think you call it plan D. Deductibles are really high. It's like fifteen hundred dollars. But if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely if you're f- relatively uh healthy then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much amount of money you know. So the- it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis. And ends up the best is to take a high deductible and and take a loss what- whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual. Yeah. I guess. Uh on the other hand you know I I had a similar had a similar health plan. And uh one of my kids was in a car accident. And uh I had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is. Um. <SEP> Really? You mean not even your your your car insurance? Well it it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here. And and I had a high deductible on the on the uh on the c- car insurance. And then s- you know we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it. Oh that's too bad. <SEP> Oh well. Yeah. Uh well I don't know. I think other than health insurance I think uh you know an extra week of uh time off would be nice. I only get two weeks. Yeah. Yeah. My place you get two weeks when you start. And then every every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks. Oh that's nice. We don't get them till till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week. <SEP> Aye. That's a long time. Yeah. It's uh. <SEP> Yeah. Especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in you know companies don't stay afloat that long. And and they. Uh with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used to be much more stable. It's a lot less stable than it used to be. They used to have job security crap. But now they don't. So you work for Bell or something like that? Yeah. It's the Bell Corps which is uh. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Right. So I don't know. It's it's uh no longer. So that's what. I think it's still based on the old model of. And and now they don't uh. <SEP> A lifelong job security. Telephone pioneers of America. Yeah. All that stuff huh. Yeah. But they no no longer. <SEP> I don't think so. Right. Uh hearing a lo-. There's always they're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security. <SEP> Is it I mean does it. They must have pretty good severance though huh? Oh I don't know. We don't we haven't been doing layoffs. We've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management. And uh I don't know what they do for those people. Mean the the the management they get rid of? Some of it. Yeah. <SEP> Um. There's too many manage too many chiefs and not enough Indians. But. Oh they they put.
sw4050.txt:Hello. I pressed the button one. So we're recording right now. I'm sorry. That's okay. I'm Bill from Raleigh. <SEP> Okay. And I'm Melanie from Harrisville Utah. Oh another one from a different state besides Texas. Yeah. Um okay. Bill we're talking about family reunions. Right. <SEP> Okay um. Have you ever had to plan a family reunion? Uh yes. And no. It wasn't really a fa- a planning one. But it was kind of uh it was a birthday. Oh. And I brought a lot of family together then. <SEP> Uh-huh. And how did you feel it went? It went pretty good. I'm I've worked in hotels. So I I kind of know how to do these things. Oh. I used to you know. <SEP> All this planning and and getting together and such. Um oh let's see what else. Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday. And and it's all of like she she comes from a big family. Uh-huh. She has like seven sisters I think. <SEP> Oh boy. They show up and all their kids. And then all she has uh. I have like uh. Let's see. She has four sons and two daughters. And they show up and all their kids. Uh-huh. So it's a pretty big reunion. It's about two hundred people maybe. <SEP> Oh my word. Well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together? Um the probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh. Uh-huh. I guess probably the most helpful thing was that um for the rent we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that. <SEP> Oh. Uh-huh. And uh each one of the everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks. And and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill. <SEP> Oh. Oh that's good. And each person in the family you know brought a dish or something. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then did you have a main meal. Or did everyone just bring. It was just pot luck. It was kind of pot luck. Uh-huh. You know everybody brought their specialties I guess you would say. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Show off a little bit. Yeah. And of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook. Oh. <SEP> Oh. Now how old is she? Uh she's eighty-six. Oh goodness. Is she pretty spry is she you know pretty. Now she does. She looks probably like she's in her early sixties. <SEP> Oh wow. And if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh. Oh that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age. Yeah. Oh yeah. My nickname for her is Honey Woman. That's what I call her. Really. Well that sounds fun. Well I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago. And there were. We sent out five hundred uh announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there. And so that was a real challenge. And I was president of our family reunion for two years. And I wasn't very at that duty for two years in a row. But I found that advance planning was the key to success. Uh also one thing that's helpful. And I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever. <SEP> Uh-huh. But most of all my family lives like in the same county. So. Oh that's wonderful though. But it's just kind of like get on the telephone. And it's so and such days from such and such date. <SEP> Oh. And everybody just shows up. <SEP> Oh well that is that is helpful. Yeah. Our family ranges from oh goodness well Australia. I have a brother lives in Australia to uh Boise Idaho and and uh all kinds of places. I would say you're spread out then. We are. Uh my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever. Because my dad was in the Army. And we're we're pretty strung out all over. <SEP> Oh. But since they've moved back to Carolinas we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County. In. <SEP> Oh. I live in Raleigh. And then my my parents live in Greenville. And I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and uh another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville. Uh-huh. So I mean we're we're spread out. But everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro. <SEP> Boy. So. Oh my gosh. Nobody moves away except us. <SEP> They must really like it there. Yeah. I got out as soon as I graduated. Yeah. Oh. Just like this town is too small for me. Good-bye. <SEP> Oh you're ready to move on to bi-.
sw4138.txt:Think about uh taxes. Well I think they're a necessary evil. Uh I wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on. And that is uh you you don't spend more than you than you bring in. You spend what you have. And. <SEP> Yeah. I think that the general idea is to s- you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy. But they're running under the assump-. You know the way they're running it now they're h- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession. So there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running. So that's kind of a basic thing of economics I guess keep spending keep going into debt. You're not going to payoff what you owe. But so I guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay f- you know get what you pay for. Well I. It just depends. Uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh. You know they need to make a living. Yeah. There's. <SEP> So I think for for for many years uh we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants uh we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society. Uh-huh. I agree with that. <SEP> But uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments. I guess. I'm I'm a student right now. And I don't make a whole lot of money. And so I I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to I guess uh compared to what I get because I you know all my my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school. And uh my education all up through high school and stuff. So I guess I'm kind of in debt I I suppose because I don't you know been paying taxes all that all that long. My parents I guess h- h- however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything. But uh I usually end up getting money back. I will this year anyway from a. Uh you're very fortunate. Yeah. I am. <SEP> I need it too. Otherwise. We just try not to pay any more in than we have to. Uh we pay in a substantial amount. Uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> We don't regret paying taxes. We do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax. Uh-huh. And progressive tax I think uh does not give people incentive to make more money. And what I mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay. More taxes you pay. <SEP> It should be I think a flat percentage. And uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount. Uh-huh. Isn't. Uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the uh nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one uh I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I totaled them all up. And basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax. Wow. <SEP> Now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though there's uh taxes on different things. Uh-huh. Well isn't. <SEP> But you know there's f- there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh. Like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax. Uh-huh. There's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes. You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank. Uh-huh. <SEP> The taxes that people don't think about that. Yeah. The the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay I guess. But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes. Uh-huh. There was that. <SEP> Which can-. Was it Jerry Brown. One of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a f- I think a flat percentage something like that. Yeah. If you impl- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money. And the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs. Right. Exactly. That's because until like eight. <SEP> And so. Based on that who do you think you're talking to. You're talking to an employer. <SEP> Up until like eighty-five or something was the.
sw4038.txt:Okay. I guess it took. So I guess the recording has started now. Yeah. Uh. <SEP> So have you ever served on a jury? I served. I was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury. A lot of the same rules apply. Have you ever served on one? Yeah. I finally served on one last year. I've um been voting for years. And I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I finally was. So it was an interesting experience. I was kind of boring. Was it civil or criminal? Uh it was uh uh it was uh well let's see it was municipal court. A grand jury or. <SEP> Uh-huh. So it was a combination of uh. And I was in the pool for a couple of weeks. I see. <SEP> So it was a combination of criminal and civil. And they had uh. Well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors. Uh-huh. And then it was always exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room. Uh-huh. Uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences. Or did you folks do that? <SEP> Uh yeah. The judge did. Uh I uh I had a hard time getting seated on a jury. I kept getting uh. I'd be questioned uh for empaneling the jury. And they kept uh dismissing me. Uh-huh. Um. <SEP> Course they don't have to give a reason. But it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know. No. They want to get the best uh mix for their case. So they ask all kinds of wild questions. That that's a science in itself. <SEP> Yeah. Well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions. And I think part of it was they didn't uh they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more. So. Uh-huh. I see. <SEP> Because you'd probably be uh too puritanical. And. Yeah. That was probably it. <SEP> Although in my case I might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught. I don't know. Uh-huh. So uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair. Or would. If you were deciding do you think that they would have been different. <SEP> Well I was never there never there for any sentencing. Uh I finally got empaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day. And uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case. And there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty. And he would never vote for guilty. Huh. So uh they appointed me jury jury foreman. And I uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict. So I told the judge that we weren't were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate. Um. <SEP> So the whole thing had to be tried over again. Wow. I bet that made him happy. Yeah. Yeah. It was uh it was funny. The uh. I ju- I I don't know. I uh I didn't uh uh I didn't like not being able to deliberate. Right. <SEP> I uh I I wanted to vote guilty for the guy. And the other people were kind of mixed. Uh-huh. So uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again. Cost him a lot of money. I'm sure. Yeah. Oh how many members were on the jury? Was it a six or twelve member jury? <SEP> Uh it must have been six. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's kind of curious to me. I didn't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh a few months ago that they had six member juries. I thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak. <SEP> Um. But uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment. Um. I know on a. Getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous. It's a simple majority you know rules. <SEP> Yeah. Well let's see. Is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous. And. Probably on capital. I don't know. We weren't we we. The two that I were on had to do with drugs. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh we were uh unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things. The government really failed to prove its case. And you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof. And we had to acquit him in both cases. Uh it was too circumstantial? Uh yeah. It was yeah in some of the critical things like the off- special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person. But something happened to the camera and the tape and. <SEP> Um. All they could do was testify.
sw4072.txt:Okay. How do you keep up with current events? Um well actually usually uh in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work uh. Usually catch the news in the morning. Yeah. What what channel do you watch or what station? <SEP> Uh N B C. That's the one I watch. I usually keep up with T V. I don't. I am a student. So I really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff. Uh-huh. So I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't too great sometimes. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I usually tend to just you know rely on you know T V uh again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like you know like what today's stories are. And I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I'm interested in any particular one. Yeah. The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes. The stations I listen to are just mainly music. <SEP> Yeah. I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all. Yeah. Do you think that T V is uh pretty accurate. I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized. Or. Well what I really don't like about T V especially local news as compared to like national news is just uh it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed. And you know it's it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is your kid's bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know? Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. It's. They mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Also also I have the observation of uh with the press is that like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story. Huh. <SEP> Yeah. It's something wrong. Going. They're looks like they're going more for ratings than for you know actual news. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers. Uh-huh. They typically have a better. I am from a small town too here in Texas and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato. <SEP> Uh-huh. And. Yeah. The farm report. Yeah. Farm report and oil reports. <SEP> That's pretty pretty sad. Or who killed who. Uh-huh. Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television. Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down. And. Yeah. Well in uh in Dallas I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's. And the story was uh. <SEP> Was that like he started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something? Yeah. And the news covered it right you know hours after it happened. Uh-huh. And they were taping people who were crying who had everything. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then like three days later this uh local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves. Uh-huh. I just thought that was really that's kind of cold. <SEP> Oh yeah. I have seen that happen lots of times. You know uh Channel X gives you the best coverage. You know we were on the scene with our team players. And. Yeah. And it was just. They were showing like these dead people. Uh-huh. And they were showing people crying. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean just taking advantage of you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> They are trying to get the you know most emotional response for. Yeah. It didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story. But just the play on people's emotions. It's just gotten so. I mean somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know. Yeah. And everything. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. You know I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know. Yeah. Uh you know even the national news I just find it to be you know very watered down. Yeah. <SEP> Very. What did you think of the coverage of the war? Uh I fou- I found it very one sided. Did you? <SEP> Uh you know it it just seemed to lack any sort of debate. Yeah. Uh you know not saying that we shou- that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there. But it just seemed like you know. They kept just showing you know how great we were doing. And it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that's. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. A lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they kind of you know. If they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press.
sw4036.txt:I think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted. Definitely. Um and I think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that. I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. <SEP> Uh-huh. Have you ever served on a jury before? Uh I have twice. Oh okay. <SEP> It was a pretty wild experience. Uh what sorts of cases were they? They were just you know small time cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know. So were they criminal or civil? <SEP> They were civil. They weren't they weren't any criminal. Oh okay. What uh what was the verdict? Did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? <SEP> Uh the jury it was uh let me see I think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people. Yeah. So it was. They. And uh the one changed his vote at the end. So did it become? <SEP> So it became unanimous you know after they turned it in. Yeah. And then he changed his mind after they turned it in. Uh. <SEP> But it then became unanimous. Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right? You just needed a majority? Right. What was what was the other case? That was also civil? <SEP> The the other case was just traffic. The. And you know it was seat belt law. Yeah. And it it didn't even hardly go through. Oh didn't really even count. <SEP> So. Yeah. I'm I'm a college student. So I haven't been you know a jury eligible age for very long. Yeah. Um and uh I did get one summons actually at one point. But I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student because it was uh a very bad time. <SEP> Yeah. Well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though. Yeah I mean I I really I would like to uh to do at some point um. But I I haven't. Uh one one thing that I I think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh I I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now. But I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well. Especially sort of. I wouldn't think that it does I mean from from my from what I experienced in them. How wha-. <SEP> It didn't you know it didn't turn out the way I planned it I mean the way that I would think that it would go. Uh you thought it turned out pretty well? Yeah. But it was you know it was. Jury was unorganized. And it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me. Yeah. <SEP> I'm not used to it not being organized. And I just assumed that it would have been. Oh so it was just kind of a zoo. And the jurors just sort of. Someone had to figure out what was going on? That's about what it was. Um. That's interesting. Did it did it work out pretty well in the end? I mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial. Or. <SEP> Yeah. They well they picked one person. And then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. So it work- it did end up working out pretty well? Yeah. It ended up working all right. The one thing I sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes. <SEP> Yes. You know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy. And it's just a matter of interpreting a contract. It's sort of a matter of um you know sometimes getting into very technical issues. And I wonder if uh if there's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion. I I don't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what's going on. In in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. So. <SEP> Yeah. The the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer that which was uh seemingly their property. Yeah. Uh. <SEP> It was on his property. Oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it. And he hadn't made the payments. Right. <SEP> So they came to get it. Yeah. And then when they came to get it well it was on the landlord's property. And he wouldn't let them take it off. Uh so they were suing to get it back. <SEP> So and they are it was a double wide. So they'd already taken it apart. Uh. So they left it there. Yeah. <SEP> And then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it. Uh. So they were suing him for the money. And you know there's no way they could because it it was the moving company.
sw4150.txt:All right? Yes. Okay. How many kids do you have? <SEP> I think w- I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children. We have three children who are eleven nine and eight. Right. So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about. But perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time. <SEP> And. Uh-huh. Anyway. You don't have children? No. <SEP> But you're married? Yeah. We we've been married for two and a half years. We've been trying for about two years but no luck yet. Oh. Hopefully. <SEP> You know I know we're not supposed to do this long distance. But actually I'm getting a call. I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting. Could I ask you to hold one minute? Uh-huh. I'll be right back. Excuse me just a moment. Had-. <SEP> They're going to get mad. She had another call. She has just three kids eleven nine and eight. Hello? Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm so sorry. All right. That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting. Okay. <SEP> That keeps you bu-. Do you have a lot of activities with your kids? <SEP> Well I don't want to I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation. But yes. We do. Both my husband and I work. And our children are sixth fourth and third grade. And the school years are wonderful. They're just wonderful. Uh-huh. <SEP> The kids they are real people. And they are interesting. And they they have all their own activities. And um I think as parents we really enjoy them in in our personal situation. Our children have not yet decided to rebel. Uh-huh. So they're pretty good kids huh? <SEP> I'm su- sure that's coming though. But they are wonderful kids. Yeah. Well we had ni- wh- growing up. I guess I can talk about us. We had nine kids in our family. We had eight boys and one girl. But my Dad uh. <SEP> You had eight boys and one girl? Yeah. And the time that my we spent with our Dad was he owned his own business. So we worked with him most of the time. So that's how we spent most of the time with him. Are you Mormons? Yeah. <SEP> That's what the Utah and the large family. That was a dead giveaway huh? Well we're Catholics. I came from a family of five. I had four brothers. Uh-huh. <SEP> The only girl. Oh. And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled. Which that. <SEP> I never felt spoiled. In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed. I was going to say my sister wasn't spoiled very much. <SEP> No. Usually busy fighting for survival. Yeah. That's. But. Well I do think with working parents it is I mean there are some real issues here. Um that I think um. Uh-huh. <SEP> I don't know. It's an interesting problem. I happen to um. I'm a pediatrician. Oh. My husband is a physician. So uh I I I talk to parents about this a lot. But children. I I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I feel when my children were very young I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing. And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home. Uh-huh. <SEP> I really believe that. And it has um helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age. And I think our kids are real secure. And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot. Uh-huh. So I know it sounds like a rationalization. But it's I really think it's true for our family. Wel-. <SEP> And I think it has worked very well. Yeah. It's like you said you know to each his own. And we're planning on having my wife stay home. And but. There's no question. I think that's really the best. If if a woman is happy doing that. Uh-huh. <SEP> I hate to put it quite that way. Yeah. I was twenty-nine when I had my first child. And uh I would not have been real fulfilled. I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother. But uh I like th- I like the way I did it. Right. I sort of worked half time. I had very flexible hours. I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year. And I you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to to mothers. Oh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um and I think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in. Uh-huh. <SEP> Some baby-sitting groups. Again I know it sounds like a rationalization. But I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children. And they they learn to share. They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure. Uh-huh. I think that helps. Well that's good. Sounds like you're have a handle on it. <SEP> Well so so. So your wife does she work right now? Um no. Not right now. <SEP> She's out. Right. Well we just moved down here. We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years. You're still trying to dry out? It's that's no problem here. Yeah. We really liked it up there. But then wh-.
sw4168.txt:Well what were you saying? Okay. I I think we're started now. Oh okay. <SEP> Uh do you want to go ahead and start? Uh well I haven't really been up to date on a lot of music. I've been in school. And I haven't really gone out and bought any or listened to much on the on the radio except for classical. And uh. <SEP> Well you like classical music? Yes. Uh I like classical music. I like rock and roll. Uh-huh. <SEP> I like country and western. Okay. Uh I I like all kinds. I like I like different things about each one of them. Well I like most of them except for country music. <SEP> Oh you don't like country? No. I think I I might like dancing to it. But I don't like listening to it. The the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music. Not the not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that. Whi-. <SEP> Oh. That's uh that's a little bit to uh. It's such. They're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing. You know what I mean? Uh-huh. Wh- what's the old country music like? <SEP> Oh like like Hank Williams. Like the old Hank Williams. Even even Hank Williams Junior is real good stuff. Uh-huh. The kind that. Oh okay. <SEP> Uh this stuff makes you cry it sounds so sad. I mean you d-. That's the kind you like you mean? <SEP> Yeah. Som- sometimes I do. I mean not all the time. Oh. Oh okay. Well I guess I I like the blues a lot. And I guess you could say it's similar as far as the kind of ma- the way they do it. <SEP> Yes. And I I I do too. I also like jazz. Yeah. Me too too. I guess I like. Except heavy metal. And uh most rap I don't like. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. You're you're about like I am then. I I can't watch M T V anymore. I used to love M T V. Oh okay. <SEP> And I can I can barely watch anymore because uh they have this heavy metal stuff on there. And and I can't even you know I can't like that. Yeah. And and I liked uh Aerosmith and Led Zepplin and uh you know and uh jeez who else is there. Van Halen. Uh-huh. <SEP> Okay. Okay. Yeah. <SEP> Now I like I like groups like that. But when you get uh. I I even like Guns and Roses some of their stuff. Uh-huh. But uh some of these groups now like Slaughter. Oh I I really haven't listened to that. <SEP> Some of them are just really rough. So so you went to school then in. I'm surprised you didn't go to to any pa- parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff. Or. Well uh I used to a long time ago. But since I've started back into school now I haven't really done that much. I've been pretty busy. Uh. Okay. But uh. So no. I haven't. I you know I used to go out and dance a lot. But I don't do that anymore either. So. <SEP> Oh I see. Are you married at all? No. Okay. I've just been real busy with with lots of other things. <SEP> Well how old are you? Twenty-eight. Okay. So you you were out of s- you went to school for awhile and quit. Then went back. Well no. I I went to school and got a degree. And then I worked for awhile. And then I just started I started back a year and a half ago. Changed directions. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. How old are you? Oh I'm uh twenty-eight. I was born in sixty-three. I guess we're the same age then. Oh okay. All right. <SEP> Yeah. And uh I didn't really start getting into music until I went to college because uh my parents didn't really have music in the house. Put it that way. Oh rea-. Were they religious? Yes. <SEP> Uh I see. I. So I'm always behind. I'm I'm not I'm never really up to date on all that stuff. But I know what I like when it's uh when I like a sound. A certain kind of sound. Yeah. My parents were very musical. My mother had a piano in the in the house. Uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. My father likes uh country western music. Okay. <SEP> He's from uh West Virginia. So that's what he grew up listening to. Uh-huh. And he's always liked it. And and you know he's probably about fifty-three years old now. So he grew up like in the late fifties. And you know when they had that the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that. And that kind of rock and roll. Huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. So he likes that. And my mom always liked that kind of stuff. My mom likes like uh Doris Day you know. Oh really. <SEP> She always had those these old Doris Day records and stuff like that though. Oh well. So you know I grew up listening to that stuff. Yeah. <SEP> But uh I could see why you went uh you know I could see why you were kind of sheltered I guess from from music. Yeah. Well I I do play the piano you know. <SEP> Oh okay. But uh I I like the uh early seventies late sixties rock. Kind of stuff the old stuff. Oh okay. And uh. <SEP> Yeah. So do I. Uh. Do you like uh like V- Van Halen or anything like that? Or how about Brian Adams? Bri-. What kind of music is does what songs does he play? <SEP> It it. Th- THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. Uh SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think I've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. Yeah. He sings that. Yeah. <SEP> He's he's from Canada. Okay. I'm not I'm not very good at remembering the uh titles. The titles and artists. Yeah. But I can remember this the song. Yeah. <SEP> Well do do you watch music television M T V at all? Or V H One? Yeah. No. I don't watch T V much at all. <SEP> Okay. So. D- do do you get cable? No. <SEP> Oh. Okay. That's that's. No. You have to get cable to get those stations anyhow. Yeah. So. <SEP> But uh yeah. I like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos. Uh-huh. I like watching that kind of thing. It's. Do you like uh like someone recent? Like Enya? Have you ever head of her. She's not rock. But she she's from Ireland. <SEP> No. I haven't heard her. Oh okay. And uh she's gotten some uh she's been on like the top ten I guess or whatever. <SEP> Oh really. She she did.
sw4137.txt:Let's see. Mine's pretty easy actually. Uh I just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns. Uh-huh. Uh and although I can't afford it right now I would just like love to have one. <SEP> Oh really. You like uh. So you're an American. Well. You want to buy American. No. Regardless of that fact. It's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money. I'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing. <SEP> Um. And uh it seems to just blow the com- compe- competition away. It terms of handling uh acceleration. Handling power everything. Yeah. It just got like the top rating. It was compared up against uh. Let's see. There was like the Mazda M X three uh Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand the Civic S I. And it just you know it it dominated over all of them. Everybody all the uh raters loved it. I like the I like the styling. And I seen a few of them actually race. And they seem to be really good cars for it. <SEP> What about Mustang G T -s? Mustang G T -s? Uh can't afford it. Those. So you're talking about ones in a lower lower end p- price range. Right. Yeah. I'm a graduate student. And let's face it. I don't make any money. So. <SEP> Right. Well you can wait till you graduate. And you'll have plenty of money. You can buy whatever you want. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. We'll see then. Yeah. Right now I'm stuck. I I've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that. It's fast but unreliable. And trying to get it prepared for racing. But it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the g- Saturn. Right. Would you use that for city driving and racing? Oh yeah. I'd do it I'd use it for both. The nice thing about autocrossing is you can you can do both. <SEP> Autocrossing is. What kind of track is that? Uh just like a uh set up a lot of times. And it's like really large uh parking lots. And pylons and things. Okay. And you put up set up the track pylons. <SEP> Okay. Tight turns hard acceleration. I've seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete. And it's interesting. They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. I would guess so. Uh what are you thinking about buying? <SEP> Uh I think I'd like to get uh B M W or if I go the German route which I'm kind of leaning towards right now but uh or maybe a Hon- I mean a a Acura Legend. Uh. The Legend. Uh. <SEP> A Lexus uh S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order. Uh-huh. I haven't really determined if I like the the Japanese or the if I like them enough to purchase one. You know because your B M W -s your German cars have good reputations I think. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well I was I was actually in uh. A lot of the B M W -s are produced in uh sh- uh Stutgardt and uh and Munich. <SEP> Yes. And I was I was there this uh summer. And uh i- I was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for B M W. The. <SEP> Yeah. They their they have the whole philosophy. I mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better which is kind of hard to take. Yeah. <SEP> I mean as you're walking through that little tour in uh Munich it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you too. Uh. Oh of course. Of course they are. They want you to buy their car. Yeah. There. It was it was interesting. I was at I I also went to uh the Porsche. And uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. The uh the B M W is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things. And everything is put together with exacting tolerances. And and then you go to Porsche. And it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade. Um. And no two of them are alike. <SEP> And. Yeah. That's. So it's like completely opposed. I don't know. Which do I like better. I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical. <SEP> No. It's not realistic. Unless it's it's a toy. Yeah. If you can afford that kind of a toy then I guess uh. Let's face it. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. But it it B M W -s good for that. What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for? Yeah. Just work. Short trips. No m- no heavy mileage. I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year. Wow yeah. <SEP> So it's pretty minimal. That's cool. Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for. Yeah. That's good. I also I was impressed by uh by the Mercedes too. <SEP> Oh yeah. I really I really like the Mercedes. But But if if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things. The factory was nice. And. <SEP> And is it different for the for the B M W? Uh I think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly. Probably. <SEP> Right. I can imagine that. So I'm kind. <SEP> Yeah. I'm not sure if I really want.
sw4026.txt:So. How's your products been? Um I really haven't had uh too many problems. Uh seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out. I hear that one. Have you had any lately go out? <SEP> Yeah. I've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three. And they. Unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time when I bought my new house. And uh I really don't have any recourse. So I had to call and have them all repaired and that. Oh wow. Yeah. It was a hassle. So you didn't get anything. Even all the all the warranties were out? <SEP> Yeah. The warranty on the refrigerator uh. The i-. The refrigerator warranty's still good. But the ice maker itself passed its three years. And it was three years and two months. You're kidding. No. Yeah. We just moved into a new house too. So we had to buy all those too. <SEP> Uh watch out. Yeah. The only thing I've had problems with is um. I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail. Uh-huh. And I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such. And when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings. So. <SEP> Um. I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than. I just ended up using it. But that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong. But. I usually have pretty good luck with appliances. But I just uh. It was within two days that all three of these stopped working. And the the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump. That's incredible. <SEP> And the uh microwave had to have uh some kind of something I can't even pronounce. And they uh. The dryer had to have a new heating element. So it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them. And they all went out at the same time? <SEP> Uh within two days of each other. Or two days. Wow. I was. It wasn't a good week. I was pretty mad. <SEP> And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business. So even if I I think even if I had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured. But still they were through that retailer. So I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not. Wow. It's frustrating. But I didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty. <SEP> So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all. Uh-huh. But I. The only other things that I've ever had trouble with uh. I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers. Uh-huh. They go out a lot? <SEP> Yeah. I've had two or three of those go out. One was under warranty. And the other two weren't. But I just. Other than that you know T V -s and things like that I haven't ever had any trouble with. I don't think products are getting much better though. Yeah. See I'm in the manufacturing. Home from work. And make um automotive air bags the safety air bags. Oh really? Yeah. <SEP> That's interesting. At Morton International. And I thin-. Well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment. We test everything after each assembly process. And so our testing is pretty thorough. But. Do you do you test each individual one. Um. <SEP> Or do you just test. Like if you've got ten you test one. And by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay? Um the tests that. Well we test every one electrically. We don't. I think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags. Uh-huh. And but we do test after during the assembly project product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it. So each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done. And then we do electrical tests on them during the process. So. <SEP> Well that's something I've never had to use. It's never I've never been involved in an automobile accident. So luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test. Yeah. But I think it's a great idea. I'm I'm. Seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about. But that. Well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government. It's incredible how much testing they have to do. <SEP> Oh I'm sure they want to be thorough before they. But uh even. You know I don't mind spending the extra money on the car if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing. Uh-huh. I'm not a real big seat belt. My uh.
sw4008.txt:Do you have a P C? Yes. I have a Macintosh S E thirty. Uh-huh. Yeah. A lot of my friends are into Macintoshes. I have a um P C a I B M P C myself. <SEP> Uh-huh. A two eighty-six. I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six. Um. What do you use yours for mostly? Um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um but I um I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that. Um what do you find that you use yours mostly for? Well I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base. And uh about the only thing. I am uh I'm just starting to get into uh a little bit more communications now. I've just today ordered a fax modem. So I'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> You don't have to make a hard copy that way. Uh-huh. Uh are you using windows? No. I I think I I'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although you know I do like the the graphical user environment. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh. Yeah. It's um. I want I want to be able I just want it more for multi tasking which I suppose is also like a Macintosh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh. Well the one thing I used to use a uh. I've never used an I B M actually. I used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. That's what I learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school. But I don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now. Uh-huh. <SEP> I don't have uh any compilers. Uh-huh. So I'm uh. Well do you use your computer for um just things around the house or in the. <SEP> I use it in my business. Well see what do you do? I uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs. Oh wow. Um and uh are these like uh do these programs um. Are are they based on on a on a um other language. Or are they based are they based. Like a lot of the um you know a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world. And the teacher just tries to tries to teach English you know through natural understanding. <SEP> That's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly. Uh-huh. You seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that. Well it was just uh when I was high school I worked for the community school. And they had a English second language class. And it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time. <SEP> Uh-huh. I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues. You can't don't have hand gestures and things like that. Right. Well now we uh. What I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though. Uh-huh. <SEP> Most of the stuff that I do is not uh interactive. Uh-huh. And I use it for t- uh data analysis on testing. So. Uh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that. <SEP> Well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh. Uh-huh. You know when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. You try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort. So it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use. Yeah. I would imagine so. Um so um what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E? <SEP> Well I was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files. I can't believe you know I've got uh five uh megabytes on this one now. Uh-huh. It it's. <SEP> And on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K. Yes. It's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much. I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it. Yeah. And you know then then we then I started playing with Apples you know. And those had forty-eight. Or you know if they were really great they had sixty-four K. <SEP> Oh the old the old Apple uh the the original Apple had what yeah forty-eight I guess didn't it. Uh I know I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them is all. <SEP> And. My goodness. There's I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K. And there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you. I'm not sure about Macintoshes. But I know I B M -s you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time. Uh-huh. You know that's that's your low- that's the low end. Uh. <SEP> Well the S P thirty goes up to eight. Uh-huh. But I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet. I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk. I don't know. They say that system seven uses a lot of memory. Uh-huh. Yeah. I imagine.
sw4148.txt:Hi. Okay. So uh with the issue of trial by jury uh I actually found the whole question about whether you need a a unan- a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting. Yeah. Actually I I agree that that's an interesting thing. I I believe that's a for for civil suits it's not unanimous right. But for for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law? <SEP> I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where uh I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve. Yeah. I actually thought I'd read that too. And that's why I phrased it that way. Yeah. I wonder. The difference yeah the difference could be that for uh state if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote. And things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require. But I don't know what the the laws. Do you think that that's an unreasonable uh requirement that they be unanimous? <SEP> Well I'd be curious as to what the uh requirement for a an acquittal is. And I I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal. But I don't know whether you need an a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit. Yeah. That that would be an interesting change. It was also allow the uh idea that if you had one person who was uh very disagreeable that I mean it it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because uh the fact that it's w- the the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt uh criterion that it uh increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgment. So I I think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision. Yeah. I'd agree with that. But I've never had the the opportunity to serve on a jury although I've been out here and registered for I guess about five years. Yeah. Actually I I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do. <SEP> But. I would like to do that. I've been out here twenty some years. And I've been called uh three different times. But I've never actually even made it into the the jury box. And because there have always been a number of people. Oh. And and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions. Uh I. Yeah. I also think that would be really good. I. <SEP> Well the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that you know after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is a you know something like a nine three or or more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right. Uh-huh. And in fact I'm not sure that that's any more uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than than anything else. Well the the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's an effect starts being that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that that uh peer pressure. And in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons. Yeah. I'd read one book I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things that uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at what had at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations. Uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing the verdict uh you know everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict. Yeah. I I understand. You you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude uh to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response. I think of the movie uh TWELVE ANGRY MEN. <SEP> Uh-huh. You ever seen that movie? Yeah. Once. Uh yeah. It's it's it's exactly that situation where uh. It's Henry Fonda. And it's eleven to one. And he's the one. I I believe he was opposed to the conviction. And uh and he held on. And.
sw4101.txt:Uh-huh. Hey Steve. Uh They just uh they just started a recycling program here I think. Actually this is my first experience with recycling program. But uh instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about uh I am starting to split stu- split stuff up. The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb. They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there. What are they doing up there? Well here in Saskatoon uh much the same thing. There is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products. Uh we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people. Uh there are areas where we could uh. Actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers. So uh we are able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing. And then there are there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers. Well primarily soft drink bottles. And so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers. And then they recycle the containers. They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container. And then. <SEP> The the deposit's only on like drink stuff. Right. Okay. On the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing. <SEP> Okay. And uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers. Uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well. Oh okay. And actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those. So uh it's fairly fairly extensive. But then again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city. <SEP> So did they. You're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group. And the handicapped group is getting the uh the money. Or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you. Well actually there's there's the opportunity for both. Oh. Okay. Generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that. Actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back. And then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit. And then I and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well. <SEP> That's very cool. You know there's a I heard about a similar program in New York City where uh a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that. But what they do is employ uh homeless I think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans. And and I think it's mostly cans. There may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not. And they uh bring them up to a one lo- one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and get more money to these people that desperately need it. Oh yeah. Uh I guess partly because of our climate. Here in Saskatoon at least the majority of central uh. Well I want to say Central Canada. But Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec. Yeah. But uh we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people. We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfa- welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing. Uh there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although uh scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds uh regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes. <SEP> Do they do it with news papers as well? They have done it some uh. But we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers. They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers. Like the shopping malls. There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects. Or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins. And then the bins are collected. Huh. Uh some of the.
sw4166.txt:Okay. Uh before a couple of years ago I had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes. And it was uh more like a funeral home. I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home. And uh then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas. And I went to one. And it just had a very good activities director. Everyone was cheerful. And now I don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore. But I I certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re- resort. Uh I have a sister that is in nursing school. And she's real interested in geriatrics. Well that sounds good. <SEP> Yeah. So uh she she's real interested in uh what Ann Richards has been doing. She's Ann Richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes. And I don't know you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor. I've heard the name. And that's about all it goes. Okay. Ann Richards is our governor in Texas. And she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes. And uh my sister's real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing. Yeah. That's one problem with the the nursing home environment. It the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse. <SEP> Right. Uh you know they don't always have their full wits about them. Uh-huh. They're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it can be pretty sad. I've got a had a grandmother who had a stroke. And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died. Oh. And you know it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida. My in- families was up in Maryland. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the other part of her family was up in uh New York state. Right. And you know it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was uh you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke. <SEP> Right. And you know the nursing home was the you know best facility to put her in. You know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work. Uh-huh. And both my uh aunts and uncle work. Which means it's you know very difficult for some-. <SEP> Right. You essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time. Right. And you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home. Which makes it you know. <SEP> Right. It's a necessary evil I think. Uh-huh. It sure is. And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive. Because cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And you know even there you have to watch out for you know. You get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there. And you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes. Oh yeah. <SEP> Right. My grandfather passed away several years ago. I was much younger. But uh he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life. And someone visited him every day. My grandmother did. But uh if she couldn't someone visited him every day. It was in a very small town nursing home. Uh-huh. And uh people didn't get paid much there at all. They didn't care about what went on. Yeah. <SEP> They would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores. Uh-huh. And uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people. And then the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for forth any loving care for them. Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the uh care that they need. Cause it's you know. <SEP> Right. Right. An elderly person can you know. It's like a newborn baby. You need to have twenty-four hour care uh answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Right. And nurses get so worn down. Uh-huh. And you know there's a lot of number of. The elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be. And remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can. Right. <SEP> Oh sure. And they feel they feel pretty helpless. And it very very hard for them to accept that. We just uh moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility. <SEP> Is it uh like a retirement center? More of a retirement home. He's got his own efficiency apartment. Uh-huh. And they provide one meal a day. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him. Uh-huh. But they do have you know group activities going on. <SEP> How's he handling that? Uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida. Uh-huh. Uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland. And it's it's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else. <SEP> Ooh. Oh sure. There wasn't anything like that that you could do in Florida? Well there was stuff like that in Florida. But.
sw4109.txt:Uh guy. Uh some of my things. I I'd like to have a short work week you know. Oh okay. And and we need you know better health insurance and you know cau-. <SEP> Okay. We can start off there. Let's just get started. Okay. If you don't want to you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it. Okay. <SEP> Okay. So I just press one then. Right? Right. Okay. Ready? <SEP> Yep. Okay. So so you think uh I think that a short work week is real nice. Uh I have a thirty-seven hour work week. How about you? Well well right now I I'm just a student. I only work part time. But I've work in the job force before. <SEP> Uh-huh. And forty hours is just too long. You just don't have any time to do anything. It seems like Saturday you get get off. But Sunday you're getting ready for Monday. And if we get have a if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday okay. And that way that more that would make a bigger market. We'd have uh more recreation. People would have time to do it. There would be less of a stress level. We'd have we'd have less crime. We'd have to we'd have to build less prisons you know less police force. Yeah. It all makes sense to me. Although there may be more crime. I mean if people have more leisure time. It's not clear. And that. It it that's that's a possibility. <SEP> Yeah. One one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance is that the small business can't can't offer health insurance. Uh-huh. And it it's too costly. And what what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it okay. So they get a specific rate. Well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and and things like that. What happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular. <SEP> Right. It's called a a group. Well what will well what happens then is that they cancel because they just can't cancel an individual. So they they have to cancel just like life insurance. They have to cancel everything. Uh-huh. So what they do is that that they cancel the insurance. And then all the people don't have any insurance coverage. <SEP> Right. So. But I'm I'm you know I'm I'm satisfied with my job. I'm I'm an engineering student. Right. And I work for my instructor. And I'm I'm not a typical student. I'm I'm older. I'm I'm in my thirties okay. <SEP> Yeah. And so I have a lot of job experience. And my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants. And he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose. Yeah. But in in the same token it's a very really enjoyable for me because I don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back. And and one of the things that I I really hate about jobs. I don't I don't like bosses that that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that. <SEP> Uh-huh. I I just really can't deal with that. So. Yeah. What kind of what kind of jobs have you done? <SEP> Well well I do wo- uh research in computer science. And I've just been doing that for a few years now. So uh I my job has most of the benefits I want. Uh-huh. Uh what I really like is I like being. Like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as I'd like. But uh you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of. Uh they also. A really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education. Like I I get night courses that they they'll cover right now. And that's really good. Yeah. Yeah. That's just great. You have what you might call knowledge power. <SEP> Right. You know when when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized. Some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist. But if you're a person who that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're you're vital to the company. Uh-huh. And you get more benefits. So. That's where I I I'm like. I'm into computers too. And that's one of the things that I've found in any one one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge. When you have the knowledge you're you're not going to uh you know be let go. Be one of the last ones to let go anyway. <SEP> Right. So what I.
sw4064.txt:Well how do you feel about trial by jury? I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently. Uh. In what way? <SEP> In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented. I have uh very little regard for the law presently practiced. Oh do do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits? <SEP> I was thinking primarily criminal cases. So do you think that I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry. Yes. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's a concern of mine. Uh I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges. Uh you know doing the sentencing. Uh-huh. The other thing the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know that a judge can be. I I like the idea of juries of your peers uh in that you you you get more personally more than one person making the making a decision. Uh-huh. And second of all you get a wide variety of background. So that. <SEP> Yeah. My question I guess are they really your peers? Uh-huh. I'd agree with that. Uh Uh too often I think they are not. That's definitely a problem. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh when you when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I think that uh in such cases uh they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased. Uh-huh. Uh now I happen to know several judges. And there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has me- doing sentencing without the jury. I would feel a little bit uneasy about. <SEP> Uh-huh. But the other two I feel uh would give either you know the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I guess that's what I am concerned with. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I I definitely agree with you. But sin- the. Well what I don't like about uh sentence the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less. Uh-huh. The the same crime gets unequal sentences. <SEP> This is very true. I uh I think there is more of an ability of you know you know for selecting a jury two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea uh the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I think I think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board. Yeah. And you do see such uneven sentencing you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such I mean where uh it would appear the crimes were very similar. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But one individual got twenty-five years. And the other one was sentenced to life. So. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh. Of course a lot of that's also the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer. Isn't that the truth? Uh-huh. <SEP> There are times when is it uh. Oh goodness my mind has gone blank it's uh Othello. You know where he says kill all the lawyers. Every now and then one is tempted to see what what. Yeah. I agree. <SEP> But I it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of you know as as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh yeah. I I agree with it. Yeah. They will admit to you that they can- don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of letting allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty. Uh-huh. It's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument. <SEP> And they are very effective too. That the. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh even. I have been involved uh just sli- slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty. Uh-huh. But uh his attorneys gotten him off. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge. So I don't know. Yeah. Uh this is a little bit of the subject. But one one thing that I really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that I have heard that there are federal sentences.
