sw4048.txt:Pretty good. Pretty good. We're talking about drug testing in the work place. Drug testing in the work place. I've been tested a few times just before employment. But that's about it. I've never had random drug testing. We have random drug testing in my business. But I've never had to do it. <SEP> They started that about a year ago. And I think it's mostly for the field people that drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff. But they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time. At least that's. <SEP> They do with alcohol. They do it with alcohol? They'll check for alcohol. <SEP> I thought it was just marijuana or cocaine. Once you start doing that stuff you're sort of stuck into checking for the whole thing. That's interesting. It's a. <SEP> What type of field of work are you in? I'm in the oil business. In the oil business. <SEP> And you work in the office around. I work in the office. So it's pretty safe environment. <SEP> I work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars. And we work around a lot of explosives. That sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on. <SEP> So that's. I'm all for it because the type of environment I work in they're working with explosives. And so they could blow up the whole. They have safety features with each of the explosives they use. But still it can be dangerous. I agree. I think that under certain circumstances especially when you're working in high risk industries where you can really hurt other people that you need to have that kind of stuff. If it's. As long as it's not abused random. As long as it's random and the individual's rights are protected I don't have that big a problem with it. <SEP> Do they fire them or do they? This is it. This is where I start having my problems with my company. I work for a private company. And the policy is something like. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling. <SEP> But if they catch you if you test positive for a controlled substance then you get fired. So it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos. <SEP> That's. I think our policy is that. It's probably the same thing. I'm not really sure what the. It's one of those things that you read once. And then if you're not worried about it you just forget about it. That's right. But I know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance. But I'm not sure if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in. <SEP> Our company's a little tougher on the second chance. If they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to go out of the way a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated to get back at your job. But when you're a private company the rules don't always apply. <SEP> Do you think it limits. It's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment. And it's not. I guess I haven't run into anybody that's been a problem. So I guess it works much like any lottery. Everybody's got an equal chance to get picked. <SEP> I'd rather have that than say this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in. And next week C -s and D -s are going to come in. <SEP> You could time it just right. I know one employee. I know when I was working with he had alcohol on his breath. And I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not. That'd be just as dangerous. Especially around equipment machinery and stuff. <SEP> That's true. I've gone out and had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case. Do they give any limits on alcohol. Or is it? I don't remember to tell you the truth. I don't think they do. They must. That just shows you how much I've been paying attention. Because I really don't know. <SEP> I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask. You can take some of that testing a little bit too far. There was a company in Houston. They did an unannounced drug sweep of their company. <SEP> It was an unannounced sweep of. It was not only drugs.
sw4113.txt:So do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time? Generally I don't think they are. My personal opinion is that the politicians are out for their own good because they're entrenched. <SEP> They don't ever have to go out and get a real job. They just stay in their current job. You know what I mean? I agree with both of those things. But do you see any way of altering it so that they would become more honest? <SEP> I think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems. But it has to be not just at the national level but at the state and the local level too. I know some senators. And I don't know which ones. But they've been in office since the nineteen forties. <SEP> And I. They've never had a job. They've never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes. I know they pay taxes. But they don't. <SEP> They get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year. Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit. And I'm going I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am. <SEP> And they work less than I do. The only problem I see with term limitations is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is with most governments is just so complex that there is a learning curve and that you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect his first day to be an effective Congress person. I think there's a lot they need to learn when you get there. <SEP> I think that's true. However I think that's always been true. That's true of the Presidency too. And we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years. And. But. <SEP> They. There is a lot to learn. But maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up. I think two years is too short. I think it would have to be extended. A term limitation for Congress would be three terms or even four terms. Or you would increase the length of each term of a Congressman. But maybe standardizing on a four year term for Congress Senate and the Presidency and then staggering them so that. <SEP> We aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years. The other thing that bothers me about our system is just that in Congress the amount of power any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there. So it's for. So unless you have actual across the board limitations the idea of. We're. I'm just going to vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work. It's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time. I think that that's true. But then you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin. <SEP> The C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency. The action isn't in West Virginia. I hate to tell the senator from West Virginia this information. But it really doesn't. The world does not revolve around West Virginia as far as this country is concerned. <SEP> The world does revolve around D C as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics. And the C I A is a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia. It might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive. <SEP> And I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that. Or is it the F B I. I don't remember. But I think there's. L-. T-. I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because officially they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative. <SEP> That's officially. We all know that that's not necessarily true. But I think that there are advantages to having seniority or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years. I think there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain. <SEP> But I think that with all the perks that we've given them. I heard on the radio back a few weeks ago during the incidents where they aren't paying their restaurant bills. And they're bouncing checks all over the place. <SEP> One of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks.
sw4071.txt:Jackie on taxes I guess I would have to say that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes. What's your feeling about that? I agree. I think taxes are high. Where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both? <SEP>. In New Hampshire we have no what we call broad base taxes. No income tax and no sales tax. We tax business eight percent. Businesses are taxed eight percent. And we have what we call the five B s. For our taxes. Booze butts cigarettes beds hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling. <SEP>. So we do have a very low tax rate. But combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes. And. <SEP> I agree. And I think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting. If you do get money back from jobs. I'm still a student so I only work part time. So I get a check back. So. That's nice. <SEP> From taxes. But. Nice to get a refund. It is. But it's not much. So. Do you think that for whatever taxes we do pay that we are getting value for it? <SEP>. My opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state. And they say they are going to send some back. It's like one arm giving the other a transfusion. You know what I mean? <SEP> It really. I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect. There you go. And that is that money tends to stick where it lands first. And when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you. <SEP> I don't know. I. Don't seem like they are doing much with it. There's plans there. And now that they are voting and people getting into drug and that stuff. <SEP> They have nice plans. But they don't always work. And then they try to raise taxes more. And I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work. But taxes get raise. So. I don't know. I'm not really into politics. That it. I don't really understand it. <SEP> But it's just. It does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend. It's almost like they will spend as much as they're allowed to collect. There is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Ten percent or thirteen percent. There would be no figuring. You would take your income tax. You would have a certain amount. You would take you total salary. <SEP> Those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes. And then there would be a set amount for however many dependent you have. And you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions no deductions or anything else after you figure up who's in your family. And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S. And it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with. <SEP> The could be nice. I'd like to see something like that. I think it would be fairer. And it would put a lot of the tax attorneys our of business. And I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail. But I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans. <SEP> It doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes. It doesn't seem fair to me. <SEP> It isn't. There is not much out there that is fair. That's for sure. I will agree to that. I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. If I am not mistaken aren't they? I mean for your state. <SEP> Do you know what your state income tax rate is? Twenty percent? <SEP> I have no idea. I just. My dad does it all for me. You just pay it. I use. You're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts. And she works as a waitress. And she is attending college full time also. <SEP> And she sends her taxes to me. And I figure them up. She really has no idea. She gets a refund check. And.
sw4096.txt:. The other day I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling. <SEP> And I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places. And they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste. <SEP> I didn't think that was a new revelation. It's not too new. What is the E P A recommending now? They really didn't propose any solutions. Actually the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A. <SEP> But he had a lot of facts to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down. And one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of news print. He was talking about the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print. And they could sell it for a while. They were able to sell it for some amount per ton. And now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away. <SEP> That's a common problem though. It seems that has happened in Dallas as well as New York. And I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house. And after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either I suppose. We're doing some here in Cash Valley the community here. We've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation. <SEP> And they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside. That's good. So one of the real keys to getting recycling for paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it. <SEP> There has to be a reuse for it. That's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Everything from waste baskets to carpet to the sticky slide rugs under the carpet. And I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days. And they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and milk cartons and things like that. And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama. And he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was environmental protection. And the other one was I can't remember what. But the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill. <SEP> And the solution that he came up with for plastics it was really quite amazing. He says the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them. He came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space. <SEP> And there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling. But there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity. So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it. <SEP> It's carbon. So that makes sense. A carbon fuel of some sort. But what about emissions? And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. <SEP> He didn't deal with that. He just said burn it. <SEP> He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical. It's interesting. I bet that was a good day at the conference then. Real interesting. <SEP> Did it change anything for you? Not too much. I got a bit. Actually.
sw4077.txt:How do you feel about gun control? I don't think that guns should be outlawed. <SEP> But it's going to. A lot of the stuff that. All you do is to get guns and then with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago But I don't really know unless they do just outlaw them how you can prevent that. <SEP> Don't you think that just having some almost a driver's license be required with stiff penalties if you are found with a gun that is not registered or that you are not licensed to carry. It varies from State to State. That. Do you even know what the procedures are now? <SEP> There is no national. But it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it. In most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. Or on probation or other obvious things like that. <SEP> And I know that in a lot of states you could be just released from a mental hospital the day before. Be obviously insane. But have your legal right to get a gun. I didn't know that. That's pretty scary. So do they want us to say where we feel about it in rating it one to ten. I'd probably say about a five. <SEP> That's where I would probably be. Seems like it's a good safe number to pick. I don't really know how they can really enforce the laws any better. <SEP> Because I do think that some people need them for protection and stuff. And I can understand them wanting to have them. But then again it's just all those nuts out there. No-. If you are looking at country where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that. The amount of violent crime has decreased by so much. <SEP> It has? Because then. The. In comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States. The problem though since the United States had this pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think if you were introduced any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already. <SEP> So it's really kind of a complex problem. Is the crime that bad there in Atlanta? I'm not really sure how bad it is. I've not really had that many problems with it. But apparently we were ranked pretty high up. <SEP> I know Dallas is. I think in the te-. I think we have been ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years. I don't know if Dallas is in the top three. <SEP> But. Do you own a gun? I've thought about getting one. If I get one I think I will probably get something. I probably wouldn't get a hand gun. I would probably get a shotgun. Just for protecting myself. From burglar type thing. I do kind of live in the downtown area. <SEP> And shotguns are really good because they're. Somebody is not going to break in steal it and use it to mug someone. That's true. And you. I just don't understand these people when they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves. They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through. They are probably going to miss the person. And they're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone. <SEP> A shotgun just really struck me as being a real good defensive weapon. You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of whoever. <SEP> When I first moved to Dallas I moved up here by myself. You pretty much stop them. And you don't. Then the actual shot doesn't go that far a wall will stop it pretty much. And my Dad gave me a gun. <SEP> But I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it. So I finally ended up giving it back to him. I said I don't want it. I don't want to be responsible for it because if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to be responsible enough to go out and learn I don't need it. <SEP> <SEP> That really does scare me. People that have guns. Because if you ever get in the situation where you are not prepared to shoot. But you pick up the gun and point it at the person that person rushes you. <SEP> And they get it from you. And you're pretty much dead. Because you've just told the person that you're about to kill them then. <SEP> Set them off. And you basically made it clear to the person that you are a real danger to them. And then if they manage to get the gun from you their first reaction is going to be stop you. That's why I ended up giving it back to him. I thought. I don't want it if I don't really know how to use it. <SEP> And I just didn't want the responsibility. <SEP> So. Did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever? Did it happen at a cafeteria or something? It just makes you wonder how people get guns. <SEP> I would be scared selling guns to people.
sw4082.txt:I get most of my news from newspapers really. I read the daily newspaper the HOUSTON CHRONICLE. And sometimes I'll read the WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES. I don't subscribe to either. But sometimes I get a hold of copies of it. How about you? Do you mostly get things from T V or. <SEP> I actually get most of my news coverage off computer networks. However I do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day. And I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day. That's interesting. You said computer networks. What sort. I am fairly knowledgeable of. <SEP> DOW JONES for example cause the news wire. That's interesting. And it's picked up and actually available at my office. So it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure. And it's sort of by category. For example so I can read a certain business or topics. I-. <SEP> Is it the A P news wire. Or is it something that is a little bit different from that? <SEP> It's similar to that. But it's DOW JONES which is the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire. So that's interesting. I had access in the past to the A P news wire. And I thought that was a pretty good way to get news. I've never used the DOW JONES news wire. But. It. Do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of a broader more long term analytical sort of approach? Actually not. I do follow. I don't know how to describe it. So I'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense. It's a weekly but not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things. <SEP> I'd like to say however that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires. In what way? In sort of quality or sort of an orientation in terms of view point or the way the news is presented or whatever? I think that it has to do with. I personally think. I have a problem with their viewpoint. And I personally think there's a strong bias in the media. You won't offend me. So go ahead and say. <SEP> Like a liberal type of bias. Absolutely. After all who writes. People who are journalist who are trained to write. And that's a liberal field at least from academia. <SEP> And the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong. And it. They generally make mistake on anything technical at least. <SEP> That's right. Even if it's not technical. If it's some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me think I'm not expert in it. They're telling me lies. By mistakes do you mean just honest mistakes. Or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things? I think both. By deliberate I mean mistakes of omission or biased toward a particular liberal view point that they have. <SEP>. <SEP> To give you an example we will go out of the printing media. I know of cases where we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. Which is rather disturbing. That's disturbing. <SEP> He does that. I haven't really noticed them doing that. But whatever. Again I don't watch T V news that much now. If I had access to C N N I would watch T V news more. But I don't usually. I don't have access either. Although I did at one time. And it was. I did during the Gulf War. And it was addictive. Did you think that the Gulf War coverage would be kind of an abnormality? I just wonde- I guess. I would be curious to know what you thought as to how C N N T V news compared to the three networks. Whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever. But I guess you wouldn't. You probably. If you just watched it during the Gulf War that probably wouldn't tell you much. <SEP> During that small sample I would think that everyone was just about the same except the three networks radio television programming. So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on C N N. <SEP> And you.
sw4127.txt:. I thought it was supposed to give a recording. But I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for my wife and for me. And I embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial. <SEP> All I do is keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month. But I doubt I do it more than three times a year. Do you use a computer? And. <SEP> I work with them all day. I'm in computer science. Yet I do everything on paper. <SEP> I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers. Mine is really simple because I got all our bills paid off when he was a Marine. He went to Saudi Arabia. And while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off. So really the only bills I have is rent utilities insurance. <SEP> So they come in. I pay them. And that's it. That's about the extent of it. That. I don't really have this major budget or anything. I'm real thrifty. I take care of two children and me and just real careful with the money. What little we have. <SEP> That's what I do. It's pretty straightforward. It's almo-. I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making fancy budgets. It seems like if you're getting to that level you're not in real good control. <SEP> I've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt. You buy something on credit. <SEP> And you pay twice as much for it when you get done. Actually I like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything. <SEP> And I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month. I don't have too many weaknesses. <SEP> But I found out a credit card was one of them. <SEP> It's so much easier if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person. It's it's on sale. Let's go grab it. And if you don't have the money then use a credit card. So I got rid of them credit cards. I guess if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do. <SEP> That was my weakness. It wasn't bad. I didn't have thousands of dollars and like that. I just learned that that wasn't for me. <SEP> But I self-employed. I have my own little cleaning business type thing. So I keep. Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that. Or. <SEP> It's not hard. I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and what it's going to have to go for that month. And it's not that hard. Not at all. That's good to know. <SEP> I always do my own income tax. Do you? I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to do it. <SEP> It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it. R-. All you got to do is read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go. I. <SEP> Just the form. <SEP> It seems absurd that people will pay some bucks just to get someone to. And a lot of them. It's dumb. I guess if you had some really complicated stuff. But I don't. So I don't mess with it. <SEP> But I don't use a calculator either. I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on. I don't have that many things to add up. So. I know too many people who use a calculator. If they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention. <SEP> And it seem. And we have a. <SEP> I bank at N C N B here. And they have a number that you can call in. And I always call in once every other week or so. And I will check off what checks have cleared. And. Do you do that? We have the same thing. <SEP> You do too? And I always check them off and check my balance and my book because I always want to know exactly what I have. <SEP> I do that real often. I do that.
sw4028.txt:I guess we're going to describe job benefits. And so what next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits? I would say the medical group insurance area as far as covering medical costs for yourself or family members. <SEP> Does your company have good benefits in that regard? I think. I work for a public school district. <SEP> So it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing. Where the school district does the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of costs. But overall I've been pleased with it over the years. <SEP> I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to change companies. Or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any. I see. <SEP> How about yourself? I'm. My medical coverage is with an H M O. So in my opinion that's bordering on a health clinic. But it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage. <SEP>. Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety calendar years. And I was in the H M O. And I was because my same doctor agreed to be in it for. They usually sign a contract or something. <SEP> And I did have surgery last summer. And I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day. And I've never seen another bill. So I have to say it really works. But again I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it. If you've been going to a doctor for ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for those people. <SEP> That's right. I'm fairly young myself. I've only been. When I first started working which. Three years ago is when I first got into full time employment. And at that time I immediately joined the H M O. And I never really. So the only doctor I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O. And for me it's worked out real good. <SEP> But if you have a family and everybody's gone to different doctors it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and just has all the medical history. And you feel comfortable with it. <SEP> I'm sure it would be very stressful. And my husband and I have just elected that if that happens I will go and just pay. You can continue to go to your own doctor. But your benefits are not as good. You mentioned you work for a school system. I work for Georgia Tech in the research branch. <SEP> And I guess another one that I rank up there high is the kind of job flexibility and time off I enjoy as a benefit. I do too. Are you talking about Spring Break. And. <SEP> Getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation. <SEP> It really. I don't think most of our teachers. I'm not a teacher. I am a secretarial executive assistant. But I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all year long frankly. It is just Texas has really. They want everybody educated no matter what it costs. And it would be just. We all look forward to. In two weeks we have Spring Break. And I don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff. <SEP> What do you do there? I'm not actually on the teaching faculty. But we have a large research organization associated with the university. And that's who I work with. <SEP> And we're given a good bit of flexibility in what we do. We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study. That's good. I would think that that type of employment one day you might be really tuned in and the next day a little luke warm or something. <SEP> And it's good that they allow you that. It. As I say the schools. We do have to work the day. But we do get many days off. And we all look forward to it. <SEP> That's the only reason I work there is that my children now have graduated from college. But at the time I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs. <SEP> And I've just continued to stay there. Are there any things that you'd like to see changed in terms of the benefits?
sw4114.txt:How you like New Jersey? It's pretty good. You get closer to the coast here. And you do get a good bit of smog and stuff especially from all the fuel cracking towers and chemical plants. I guess it's fairly industrial? <SEP> It's. When you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial. But I'm about thirty miles west of there. So you have actually green trees such that you don't notice that that other part of New Jersey exists. <SEP>. <SEP> Actually very. You go even a few miles out and you got farms and everything. So you relatively clear air. <SEP> But. I don't know about you. But I've always considered automobiles to be probably the prime contributor. There's a lot of contributors. But it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that. Definitely. It's. <SEP> There are a large number of them on the road. They're all going. And a lot of them are in relatively poor repair. That's a big issue is. A lot of states don't have a inspection law. So you get a lot of people out there without E T R emission control systems on their cars and things like that. Even where you do have the inspections the inspection is once a year. And it's like. <SEP> You get the car that's in the accident. And muffler falls off or something. And guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that. I guess from what I hear though next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars. They're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California. <SEP> That. And I think also some of the car companies are coming out with gas powered fleets so you. Natural gas powered rather than gasoline. I'm hoping that comes along quick. I was reading an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going. And I guess it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize. And I know it's not due to gasoline or to carbon monoxide so much as the C F C -s. But. <SEP> It is coming from cars though. I think that's a contributor definitely. The car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of the freon. Which is one of the major fluorocarbons. <SEP> I guess right now what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because I guess United States and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production. But it. <SEP> It. Go ahead. It's the type of thing there that. The Third World countries are less industrial. And they want to become industrial. <SEP> So they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S. The U S used all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today. And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if that makes any sense. In terms of. Or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to where we got to. <SEP> Those are joining arguments. But I don't know. That's kind of an interesting situation there. Those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting. I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles. And it's increasing even as near the Equator as Florida and Cuba and those places. So it's kind of an interesting situation. It's not a real good one actually. <SEP> But. You also have the very close related thing of the rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants. <SEP> You don't get that source of cleansing anymore. Have you been in big cities a long time? <SEP> I've mostly been in the east coast. So that's going between Atlanta D C area. So you've got. A-. Those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard I would think. <SEP> Not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the inversion and Los Angeles and rest of California which is just terrible. Denver's definitely. That's one of the worst. <SEP> Denver's that real good example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does I guess. Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the world for that. <SEP> But I've been pretty lucky. I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although I'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida. And there you can tell that it's getting worse. Definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver. But you can. There it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry that would be causing it. <SEP> And there's not that much in terms of public transportation down there. There is. But it's.
sw4151.txt:Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore? That's a good question. There was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed. But since I've become a parent and since I've seen things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that. I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people. <SEP> And try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment. Of the statements made by people against the death penalty I like the statement made by Cuomo. Cuomo is. He's governor of New York. But he's against the death penalty. But he said that he would want to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if they did something to his wife. And that's. But even in that situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the things. It's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response. <SEP> And that was the thing that killed Dukakis back four years ago when someone asked him a similar question. And he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for a gut level reaction. And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. Whether it be a biblical force the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life type logic or just some sort of anger at putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill. <SEP> I think people are working at that from more of a gut reaction than a a reason humane one. I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do. Are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or that aren't conforming enough to society so that we work well together. Or are they. Is it a penal institution? Is it designed for punishment? The death penalty surely fits in well in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment. Perhaps not in the manner that we do it. But in theory it fits in. In a reformatory. If you put someone to death you obviously can't reform them. <SEP> That's true. The other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent. And I really don't agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say I was about to kill and dismember this person. But if they catch me they're going to kill me. So I better not do it. I just don't think that it works that way. <SEP> I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. People say that. But if it was really a deterrent I think horse thieves in the old west. They saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. And if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent I would think that it would be public. I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it. If someone ever. If. Say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and see a guy burn or something or shot by a firing squad or something like that. I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than telling them that there's protestors out here at the. <SEP> I don't know if that would really work that way or not. There's a lot of violence.
sw4022.txt:I don't know. I think the budget is really out of hand right now. And especially in this election year I think that there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this. <SEP> It kind of seems to me that everyone's offering their token little tax cut program when it's just such a bad time for it. And as you said mostly they are token cuts. Especially what for instance George Bush is offering. <SEP> The ninety-seven cents a week. Ninety-seven cents a week. What. That's really not going to do a lot of good to your average middle income person. <SEP> Another ninety-seven cents. You can buy a coke or something for that. Mostly it's not actually a cut. It's just a cut in the amount withheld. <SEP> I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot. That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either. I haven't really heard much of what the other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either. Especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point. <SEP> In retrospect was it Mondale or Dukakis that said I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes? I believe it was Dukakis. <SEP> It was Dukakis. But I can't. I have a lot of respect for him. That's better than George Bush who came out and said No. I will not. <SEP> Read my lips or whatever and then ten months later he said I can't follow through on this. <SEP> But it seems to me that the budget is so out of hand. And especially now that they say the cold war is over. And we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of X number of billion trillion dollars a year. I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go. Because in my opinion I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this so-called peace dividend. <SEP> It's. If they could actually put something together and make. I'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because I feel that they waste money also. But with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever. <SEP> I think that would be a great idea. <SEP> It would help unemployment greatly. And it. And in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country. <SEP> Infra structure is in. We have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the cold war. And there's no way that we can ever really recover from the state that we're in right now unless we focus on the infra structure. And I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now. <SEP> I agree totally. It just seems so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen. I'm in college right now. And. So am I. <SEP> Where do you go? I U. I go to Georgia Tech. <SEP> And in. What. I had the required political science class a couple of years ago. And one of the things we discussed was how the budget situation just got so out of hand. <SEP> And essentially what happened was. I think it was in the tax year of eighty-one. Ronald Reagan basically said I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and created this ludicrous budget that he knew that the Congress would not in their right mind pass. And the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit. <SEP> And you just. You just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington. <SEP> It's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun. It's more than a loaded. It's a loaded cannon. They've got trillions of dollars to spend every year. And they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money. <SEP> What really bothers me is it just seems like if anyone were to say I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're going to have to do some unpopular things he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected. <SEP> It's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing where people just want to have whatever will make them feel good right now. For the moment. And that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again. <SEP>. And then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said. <SEP> Or it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference. It. I don't know. I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. Not at all. <SEP> I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive.
sw4177.txt:. Do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have? Actually. Because I'm in school. I kind of miss out on most of the current events. I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it. Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then? <SEP> I don't watch a lot of it. But that's the on-. Basically that's my only major source of information. What about you? I read. I get a bunch of different things. I get a newspaper every day. And I try to at least have a few minutes to look through that. And I look through. I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I pretty much read that cover to cover. And I as far as. That satisfies most of the short term news I get. Don't watch much T V. Don't have enough time. And don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that. They might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened. <SEP> And that's about all I ever hear of it. But most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK. And for the longer term I read SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they. The news isn't immediate what you'd generally think of as news. But it's recent material. And it's more in depth. It is more in depth less broad. Actually it's probably isn't less broad. But it's just more in depth. And it is more just significant information. It is the big events not the little events. <SEP> Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main. I know. Where they're just trying to fill in. Or they're making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news. <SEP> I get kind of bored watching T V actually when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow. I know. I do too. And then there's nothing that really is so exciting. <SEP> You may find one little news item interesting. So you have to wait twenty minutes to hear about it. That's about what it ends up being. Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something. Actually you mention NEWSWEEK. I do like U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. I don't get to read it as much as I like. But I think that's a good magazine. I think they're about the same. They certainly have a very similar charter at least in my mind. And what kind of news normally interests you. What do you find interesting versus what do you find boring? <SEP> Right now trying to keep abreast of what's going on in Europe with all the U S S R's satellites breaking off trying to become independent and European community coming together. <SEP> That's going to affect our economy quite a bit. I think it will. They keep claiming it's going to have a big influence. But we've yet to see it. And th-. It's real short term yet though. It's only been three months or something like that since that happened. <SEP> But they like to tell us that it's going to be important. I'm pretty sure it is because once Europe becomes unified and their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be kind of hurting. I think it is too. <SEP> I think that's a possibility. We might also be helped though because it will be easier to do business over there too. Definitely. For the companies that already have a presence over there. And I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time. <SEP> So they have a toe hold. I good toe hold. Because once you're in there then you can easily expand. But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult. <SEP> Because when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist. And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist. Even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist. <SEP> England doesn't want to do one thing. And Sweden doesn't want to do other thing. And they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet. And some of it is. I'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified. <SEP> I can understand their viewpoint. They're starting off. Their economy's a little bit weak. So you want to get established before they com-. Before they open up their borders to everyone. <SEP> What is the. Do you watch anything with sports or anything like that? <SEP> Actually I'm not really into sports. My roommates are. So unfortunately I forced to watch quite a bit of sports. Against your will. <SEP> We have to fight over the remote control. At least you guys have a remote control. It's sometimes better to not have one of those. Course you can always. Misplace it not mislocate it but misplace it. <SEP> And.
sw4129.txt:What are your views on capital punishment? I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is. But on the other hand it is very expensive to maintain. Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country. <SEP> And it's eating us alive budget wise. And. Are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state? We do practice capital punishment. <SEP> But the nature of the courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed. That's similar to Georgia. And then I was reading in the paper just this morning that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that. That's probably true considering. <SEP> I guess in a way that it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if. <SEP> I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. Who would see it. That would be the intent of it. <SEP> But I'm not sure how successful that is. I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals. Quicker maybe. <SEP> If the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment. <SEP> What kind of work do you do? I'm a research engineer. I work with Georgia Tech. I'm a school principal. <SEP> Elementary school. And in a very poor section of town with predominantly Anglo kids. And I see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do. <SEP> And I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that. Course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there. But I think we would make a bigger investment in kids. We'd have fewer decisions to make. Down the road. That's probably true. But I guess there's other factors that. <SEP> But pumping more money into the school system is a good thing. <SEP> I'm not talking about just in the school system. But it's not going to. I see. <SEP> I'm talking about. In. I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared. I know the institutions don't work that well. But it's a bad day because I get all these kids through my office. I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids. Five hundred of them are good solid kids. And I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day. <SEP> And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible. Some of them in the penal system. So that's a difficult situation. And you just see those kids going down the road. Not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment. But some of them have already been in youth centers. And that kind of thing. <SEP> And if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals. And I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system. I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action. I think that's one reason we have problems in schools. And some of them are our problems. But a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do. <SEP> But that's another subject. But. That's probably true. W-. I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them. I guess that's not an easy solution. There's no easy solution for that. <SEP> I don't know that there is an easy solution. But if you could find a way to prevent some of it. It would be money better spent than. <SEP> Do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard? That's true. I'm sure it is. <SEP> Statistically that's true. I don't. Certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems. But. <SEP> Are you for it? I'm for it in some cases. I guess I am for certain cri-. <SEP> In certain crimes. <SEP> What kind of crimes would you use it for? Premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature should definitely. Any mass murderer type individual. <SEP> I would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going. Not one instance but perpetual abusers of children. You always have castration. <SEP> Somebody elected that recently. I read about that. And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it. <SEP> But.
sw4103.txt:The question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a long term financial plan and monthly budget. The only thing I do now is put the data into Quicken. I don't know if you are familiar with that. I have some friends of mine who use Quicken. And I've considered using it once myself. But I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date. <SEP> So I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now. I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then not bother to total it. And then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic. So it really helps with that. <SEP> It's similar problems. But we just have the one check book. And we try to keep it up to date as much as possible. And occasionally we will get behind like you say. But it doesn't really seem to be too tight if we just remember to keep everything up to date and balanced. How to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances? Actually we haven't had to. Until just recently. I guess we've got a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way. So we needed to start doing more of that just for saving for college and things like that. <SEP> We try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that. That's pretty good if you can do that. I know. I have a daughter who's ten. And we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point. But we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college. <SEP> So we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall. And then the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund. Sounds good. I guess we're just at the point. My wife worked until we had a family. And then now we're just going on the one income. So it's a lot more interesting trying to. <SEP> Find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to do it. Kind of enforce the savings. But it will be interesting to see. <SEP> Our situation is just kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently took on a full time job almost full time. So it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing. <SEP> That sounds good. But I was just curious what part of the country. Stockton. <SEP> How about you? Cincinnati actually. I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with the western accents or something like that. I don't know how many people are getting involved in this. But that's interesting. I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by reading TELECOM DIGEST. Or was there another? <SEP> A colleague of mine at work got some information over the computer network called INTERNET. That is how I got it as well. But. And he just forwarded that on to me. And it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in. <SEP> So I sent back mail. It would be interesting to see how the data base. I guess we're talking about the experiment. <SEP> Probably need to try to get back on the topic. But it's hard to talk about finances without getting to dollar figures I guess. We could talk about some of the long range goals. And. <SEP> What other long range goals do you have besides college? I think either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point. I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that. It seems like every year my employer just gives back a little bit your tuition reimbursement. <SEP> They use to reimburse one hundred percent. And now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class. And it's a real shame from what we had before because we're.
sw4130.txt:So Julie how do you feel about AIDS research? I think we definitely need more of it definitely. I'd agree too. But it seems like it just makes economic sense in that. It would have made even better economic sense to have had a lot more research than a longer ago. <SEP> For certain. Because the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients. <SEP> Do health insurance policies for companies and things do they cover diseases like that? I think they cover AIDS. But what they do is if you apply to get a insurance policy they'll check to see if you're H I V positive. And if you are not only will they not give you a policy. But they have. There's a database of people that have tested positive. So you'll never be able to get insurance ever again. <SEP> But that's why they should have started doing stuff before. Still since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people who are draining a lot of money right now. I think a lot of it was just that because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about. <SEP>. That. <SEP> And all these God-fearing people were God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera. One humorous retort I heard was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people. <SEP>. But. <SEP> That's a good one. <SEP> Do you actually think we're doing enough right now to. I really don't. I did a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff. And really we're not doing much at all. Most of what gets raised it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by conscious communities and things like that. Private organizations. <SEP> San Francisco has a real strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff. And they get donations from the community And from corporations around the city for AIDS research and that kind of thing. <SEP> And I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level rather than just in the places where it's predominated so far because it's bound to spread. <SEP> It seems that it's just going to reach a steady state a lot lot higher point than it will if we'd nip it in the bud to quote Barney Fife. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the likelihood of that is. But people really waking up. <SEP> Especially with the ultra conservatives move our political system sort of seems to be taking. I would probably agree with that. <SEP> So. So do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of people? That's a good question Fish. I don't know. I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or research per se but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society kind of like lepers would. <SEP> And it's really not necessary until the disease reaches its final stage becomes really infectious. <SEP> And I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they don't have to be just completely cut off from the community. <SEP> And I don't know. I guess I think that research is the most important just because it really needs to come to an end. I don't know. I don't know Fish. What do you think about that subject? I think it stands a really interesting question of.
sw4175.txt:I don't believe that we're. What do you think about recycling programs in Atlanta Julie? The recycling program here is just terrible. It's hard to find places to go. Kroger does a couple things. Do they do newspapers? <SEP> I don't know. There's big bins out there. I don't know if they ever get. I really don't know what the details are. There should be someplace where you could call and find out. As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest thing to you. But I think there should be some kind of curbside service. That's the only way I could really. The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans like soup comes in and stuff. <SEP> They pick up everything. During the summers around where I live the homeless people see-. They all have shopping carts and stuff. <SEP> And they go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff. And so we used to just save them up. And then they'd come around. And we'd give them to them. <SEP> But when. During the winter time they move south or something. So I don't do that anymore. And the recycling at Georgia Tech like that outside the student center they never empty those things. <SEP> I know it. I know it. They just overflow. It piles up. <SEP> What's a guy to do. I asked myself. <SEP> I just don't know. I just don't know. And now they have bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center. You can't really unload all your stuff. <SEP> That's true. Hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient. Inconvenient even. I know it. I know it. <SEP> But. You do recycle don't you? I'm kind of bad about it. The. <SEP> If I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there. But I don't ever take anything. It's real. You ought to because the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything. <SEP> And since we go there all the time. But wait. Probably at all. <SEP> I've never seen you before. Who are you? By the way may name's Julie. <SEP> My name's Bill. I'm from Atlanta. <SEP> Me too. <SEP> Is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie? I just think that everybody ought to do it. Do they do. What about. What kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know? The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs. <SEP>. What about those grocery bags? They have. What I used to. Now that I don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot. But I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over. <SEP>. But also most places Big Star does. And I'm not sure if Kroger does or not. But. <SEP> They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic. And they have little boxes that you can put your old bags in. Can bring them in. <SEP> Those petroleum products are going to kill us. I know it. I know it. The hostile planet Julie. <SEP> It really is a small hostile planet. <SEP> Those petroleum products are the great Satan of the recycling. Did you know that. Really not. Did you know that something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is. Filled with paper. <SEP> Paper just seems so innocuous. <SEP> Paper doesn't seem threatening at all. It is though. It comes from trees. How can it be bad? It is because they. <SEP> They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it. They do treat paper with chemicals. Yellow paper takes something like twenty times as long to decompose. <SEP> You can bury a piece of yellow paper. It will still be there in a couple of weeks. <SEP> It will be whole. You'll be able to read off of it. I'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads then. <SEP> I'm glad you told me that because I use those at work where I work. But I can just forget that from now on. <SEP> W-. I'm going to switch to the white ones. White paper's bad too. They treat it too. <SEP> What about papyrus made out of bamboo stuff from the banks of the Nile. I'm sure that's fine. I'm sure. <SEP> Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again. You think so? Maybe. <SEP> Tablets? I think we should just abandon the written word altogether. You think? <SEP> I don't know. I think we've kind of. What do you think? Everybody has a computer. <SEP> Kind of radical I know. But. We would no longer need paper at all. <SEP> That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist like Dick Tracy. <SEP> I would love that.
sw4074.txt:. What kind of pets do you have? We have one rotten cat. One rotten cat. <SEP> It's my son's cat. I heard a laugh in the background. That's the boys. They know I don't like it. Don't you like cats? <SEP> I like cats. This cat is more like a dog. He's a one owner. He likes one boy in the family and that's about it. That's odd. How does he treat the other people? <SEP> Just stays away or runs usually. But he'll follow my oldest son around. When he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap. But if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing. Did he raise him or something? <SEP> We bought the cat for him. And so he's been the one that spent the most time with him. But I've never owned a cat like that. I've had cats growing up all the time. And they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody. <SEP> That's interesting. So it's a weird cat. We have a mutt. <SEP> A mutt. We named it Hooper because that's where we got it from. Some lady she. A lot of people drop off abandoned pets at her house. <SEP> And she use to work for a veterinarian. So she would neuter them give them all their shots. And we saw an ad saying it was free. So we went down there and picked it up. And it's been an excellent dog. But it's my first dog I've had. And we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work. <SEP> So that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work. Is that kind of your child right now? Right now it is. <SEP> You feel like. It's kind of good training. We have been trying for kids. But right now we haven't had any. But it's pretty good training really keeps her on her toes. <SEP> Have you had dogs before? My brother has. We didn't do a lot with them. I never felt like it was mine or anything. You couldn't do anything. But that did more responsibility. When it's yours and not your brother's. <SEP> But. We've. When I was growing up we always had a dog. And we had mostly mutts. Not mutts but mixes like one or two mix. <SEP> And those dogs always seem to be the best dogs. That's what we found. Ours is like a cockapoo. I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle. <SEP> But it's a really good dog. I don't know. They seem to listen better or something. <SEP> Is your cat a purebred? It's just an accident. <SEP> From my son's friend down the street. Their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens. So. Would you ever want a dog in the family? <SEP> I would. We had a dog that was a mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador. And I should say a pup. And he was just too big for our kids when we got him. <SEP> And when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was a pet. And it was a dog that we gotten. And he was just too big. The kids couldn't handle him. And I was still going to school. And my wife was working. And I was working. And so we just didn't have time to really train him. So he was too big for the kids to handle. So he was just tied up to a post. <SEP> So we gave him to. I don't know if you've. There is a place out here called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville. And they have. I guess it's kind of an animal shelter. But he just takes a few the animals in. And some he destroys. And some he keeps. <SEP> So we took him up there. And he ended up keeping him. Cause he has had him for six or seven years. We saw him just about a year ago. And I thought that sure looks like that pup we gave away. And so we asked him about it one day. And he said yeah. He's been the best dog I've ever had in my life. <SEP> Just goes everywhere with him. He would have been a great great dog. He just needed a lot of time.
sw4033.txt:How do you get most of your current event information? I'm going to school right now. And while I'm working I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot. <SEP> And I don't watch T V as much really either because my free time is kind of. And I do like to do other stuff with it. While I'm at work sometimes on the computer network I read the news sometimes. <SEP> And that's kind of helpful. I would imagine going to college though your professors and different things. You keep up on what's going on. That's true. My roommates and stuff people around me talk about it. <SEP> And the people I work with are pretty up-to-date on that kind of stuff. So. I'm a housewife. I have three kids. And so I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then talking with people and just hearing what's going on. <SEP> Do you watch major network news. Or do you watch the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR? Just the regular channel just channel eight. <SEP> That's our channel here. That's the eyewitness news. <SEP>. Where I am channel eight's public T V. So it's kind of different. <SEP> I think a lot of the commentators on the major networks it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on. But it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they report on the news. And I think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not. And basically if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will kind of publicize his name. <SEP> I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on. Because they can only report on. They give each candidate perhaps ten second blurbs in which to say you just can't get a full picture of their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it. <SEP> And the news too it just doesn't cover that many stories. It just covers your basic violent crimes and your catastrophes with weather and stuff. But other than that you really don't know what's going on. <SEP> I will read our current letters that come out on elections. And I guess I do read that. And I do study who's running in our area. And I do study what's going on in the economy. It. And I guess I do read other magazines too to get my information. What kind of. I subscribe to SCIENCE NEWS. And that's real good because it gives a brief summary of or the updates of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would bog me down that I wouldn't know about. <SEP> But other than that I don't really read. I don't really subscribe to anything else. I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST. But now I guess I just have friends that clip articles. Or if I am interested in something of course when we were in war I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on. <SEP> But a lot of the times I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper. But I just can't seem to find the time. If they put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things. <SEP> But. <SEP> I remember back during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on because they were going constantly with that stuff. But. They even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of. And people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news. We just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas. <SEP> That we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's just more information. If they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would probably take the whole news hour. <SEP> But. I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the summer olympics. That's. Already they're having. In the newspaper they have a section every now and then on the Olympics. And they've got a countdown. It's sixteen hundred days or something. I know we're trying to get tickets to it right now. <SEP>. That's going to be crazy that time of year here. <SEP> But. I can't believe. They're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over. I guess people want to hear about it. Also big in the news right now is the Braves because they're in spring training or whatever. <SEP> And they did so well last year. They spend a long time on sports. And I think that that's fine I would like to see more time spent on other things. But. <SEP> It seems like. I don't know. They way they do the newscasts I wish they kind of separated it. If you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it. But I don't have cable.
sw4158.txt:Are you working right now? I am. I'm working in the computer science department here at C M U. <SEP> What kind of work do you do? I'm doing basically system design work and implementation work for the speech group here. <SEP> Wh-. Is that how you heard about this thing? <SEP> Actually through electronic mail. Me too. I work at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. <SEP> I'm a co-op student. So I work and go to school about halftime. And I really don't have any job benefits to speak of. We're kind of. I don't know. They just kind of forget us on that end. We don't really have any vacation or sick days or health care or anything really. So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away at this point. <SEP>. What about you? <SEP> I'm research stuff here now. So they have okay benefits package. It's not quite as good as industry. But one of the significant benefits here is that you can take up to two courses a semester. And they pay for the classes. So Carnegie Mellon that works out to be a reasonable benefit. <SEP> They do that if you're research here. Then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters. And I think that they might pay for that. Pay for the classes and stuff. But I know they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage. They'll let you work halftime if you want to finish. <SEP> If you want to do it quickly. You want to. They'll let you decrease your number of hours by any percentage just about so if you want to get your masters. And then I think of course with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due. So that will probably help out. <SEP> But Do you get any kind of health care type stuff? So I don't know in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary. I. <SEP> We do. We have to contribute a certain amount to it. And it's kind of split between C M U and the employee. <SEP> I think that's a pretty important part of it there because that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems. I think my. I'm still covered with my dad's health plan where he works. But it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own. <SEP> And right now it's the. Like everywhere else. Here in Pittsburgh the health care rates are going up pretty quickly. <SEP> That's a whole other topic to begin with too. They have. But. But you are right. I really agree that that's pretty important. I guess the only real benefit for me working here besides. I'm learning and stuff because I'm in school. <SEP> But there's some weird law where student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. <SEP>. Though that's about five percent right there. <SEP> That's a big win. So. <SEP> That's. That's about the only real bonus. So I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate how much I get paid real because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to pay an extra five percent or so. <SEP> I figured for. And they've just raised the income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying that as well. <SEP> If you could call it a benefit that C M U i-. The other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is consult for other companies. <SEP> So that kind of helps out in terms of keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry. <SEP> In case you ever need to bail out. Help a lot. Around here it's like. We pretty much work from project to project with different sponsors. <SEP> There is not a whole lot of funded research from.
sw4155.txt:What's our topic? Taxes. Taxes. <SEP> Do we pay too much? Do we? What do you do? <SEP> I guess that. It all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in. My tax bracket is pretty high up there. I generally pay the maximum tax bracket. <SEP> And I think that we're paying too much. Because I don't have any children. And I pay a lot of property taxes. <SEP> I don't use an awful lot of city services. It's like I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes. <SEP> And there's so many people who want a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is. <SEP> And I just. Many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes. How about you? Do you pay too much? I can't really complain. I'm a student. And I work as a co-op at Georgia Tech Research Institute. And I'm going to get back most of what I pay in taxes. And one of my parents is still claiming me. <SEP> When you go out into the working world it changes quickly. <SEP> I'm sure. You look at your paycheck. And you go where did it all go. <SEP> What kind of. Have you pay a lot of in ta-. Have you been out working and then gone back to school. Or did you go directly from high school into college? I went. I did work for some time. But I didn't make enough money to really make too much of a difference. To worry about it. <SEP> Have you been active in politics concerning this? Have you worked on political action committees or something like that? I haven't. I haven't done any of that type of work myself. <SEP> But every once in a while when I hear up here in D C area one of the radio stations has been talking about the Congress. Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there. There's a bank that they all bank with. And I guess it went defunct recently. And one of the Congressmen has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks. <SEP> And we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule. <SEP> And it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to D C anyway. <SEP> It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur. I think we pay too much. And I look at my paycheck. And I make. Let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes. <SEP> I think I pay forty-two percent. Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government. <SEP> And then they charge me sales tax. And they charge me gasoline taxes. Taxes. And they charge me all these others. And it's just too expensive. <SEP> I can't believe that. I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for. You know what I mean? <SEP> Have you used student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government? I haven't. My father pays for my tuition. So I haven't made use of that. What are you studying down there? Physics. <SEP> Physics. That sounds like a fun field. Everybody says that. <SEP> Scientific. Heavy science. <SEP> Are you in the particle research or anything like that. Or is it more applied physics? I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet. Actually the degree I'm getting is physics. There's a different one for applied physics. So I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied. <SEP> Maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's come rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward. I doubt about that. Are we pretty steep compared to most countries? <SEP> Actually I don't think we are. I don't think so either. Europe England. I know the taxes are a lot higher. <SEP>. <SEP> But they do have socialized medicine and things like that. And I know I was reading in the paper that they're talking. Or maybe it was on the radi-.
sw4023.txt:How do you feel about crime in the city? You say you're from Atlanta. Actually I live in the city. <SEP> And I guess it is a concern of mine for my own safety. Do you find crime in Atlanta really. I live in Atlanta also. That's right. I think it is bad in certain areas. <SEP> However I think the area that I live in the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the city. I think it seems that there's certain areas where the crime is focused. <SEP> What do you think can be done about the crime in the city? I think what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put more guys more cops higher visibility. And they've had some impact but not a tremendous amount. <SEP> And probably they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing I think. I probably agree with that. <SEP> Particularly in some of the housing projects that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused. And they've got to do more than just having cops there. They've got to kind of change the way people think about it. That's probably true. So do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities? <SEP> I've been to. I'd say it's probably in the top ten in terms of crime. It's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example. Probably not as bad as Detroit. I don't think it's as bad as L A either. <SEP> I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have. That seems to be true. If you've ever been to New York City. And as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed. <SEP> It's that obvious. I don't know. I came to the conclusion also that if you are walking in a downtown area where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's going to just keeping your senses about you and trying not to look like a victim. <SEP> That's true. Just walk in a confidently. With a big stick. Or. And don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are. <SEP>. <SEP> Don't walk down an alley. Or don't get. Just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation. <SEP> But. There are times when you can't avoid all that. And then you're kind of on your own. Have you ever been mugged in Atlanta? <SEP> The only thing I've ever had was I've had my wallet lifted. But that was in a more of a setting where there was a number of people around. And I kind of got. I was much younger at the time. <SEP> And kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so I didn't know who had it. <SEP> I've had that happen. But that's about it. I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged. I think I've only actually seen one actual robbery with a gun. <SEP> And that's been about the only potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta. I've had my. And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed. <SEP> I've had my car stolen. So maybe that counts. Where was that? Was that downtown. Or. <SEP> That was up near Cumberland Mall area. It's actually Cobb County. But it is Atlanta. Metropolitan. <SEP> And there's a lot of car thefts in that area. I've known some people that have had their cars stolen. And about half the time the A P D seems to recover them in various states of disrepair. Up on blocks. <SEP> My friend had a V W Rabbit. And when he got it back his dashboard was sitting in the front seat. It had been wrecked and some superficial type damage. But they didn't strip it. <SEP> So I got it back. You're probably luckier than. Than most. So does insurance pay for the body damage. Or was that all there was body. <SEP> It was about three grand to put everything together. They cracked the steering column of course to steal the car. <SEP> You crack the steering column. And you pull the. There's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars. And you can start it up basically pretty easily. So how do you know this much about stealing cars? <SEP> After I found mine I had this.
sw4079.txt:. Frank what type of budget do you or your family have? I don't know that we really have a budget. I have a set amount that I save. Actually there is a way. Budget our money apparently. The. My wife gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks. And we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that. And besides that I have a set amount that I save every month. That's sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have. <SEP> I am single. So. I guess I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget. But I basically. <SEP> Really don't need to. I don't need to. I am the only that I have to keep track of. So it makes it a little bit easier. That's right. And also I try to save a certain amount each month as well. <SEP> And I try to have an idea of what my expenses are. And I am pretty consistent from month to month. And whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it. <SEP> I found that things as I have gotten older. I am in my fifties now. But before we use to have a very strict budget. I had four kids. And we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for this and for that. Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be. I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I kind of fence off areas of my check book. For instance there are certain things that I know come up every so often. Every six months I have to pay car insurance. Every six months I have to pay my taxes. So I take a set amount. I've got a money market account that I do a lot of saving in. And I also have got a checking account besides that. But what I do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out. And I put it in parenthesis. I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up. <SEP> Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it. Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside. And I guess that's a way of budgeting. That's. I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More medium or longer range. I just have maybe a targeted amount that I will save for. I am. Probably within a year I would like to buy a new car. <SEP> So I kind of have an amount in my mind. And I am making every effort to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever. Cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too. <SEP> We've got two cars. My wife has a car. And I like to drive pick up truck. So we are on a schedule where I try every three or four years to buy a new one. And I am constantly making car payments. But I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments. So I get one paid for. And actually I am saving up for another one besides. So it's kind of a never ending thing. <SEP> But you try to schedule those things so that you're not paying for two at the same time is what I am saying. <SEP> Have you thought about leasing? I have thought about it. But leasing wouldn't. I don't use it for my business. I see. <SEP> My wife uses hers just for pleasure. And I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away. So. But if you are rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that. <SEP> I guess. Typically if you purchase your own car you tend to make the best returns after you pay it off. <SEP> Of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself. You're right. I have been know to keep trucks or cars for ten or twelve years. But I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill. And you got to put stuff in them. That's right. Mine's seven years old. And I think last year that was a rough year for it. I had a number of expenses. <SEP> But I am hoping that most of them were just kind of. The. As you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that. So I just went through that whole set last year. I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again. <SEP> Those things can really upset your budget when they come in. It's nice to have a little bit set aside for the unexpected. So that it doesn't kill you all in one month. What line of work are you in?
sw4152.txt:I. I did forget to ask you. What is your name by the way? I'm Ann. You're Ann. But I. Lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject tonight which in some criminal courts the. <SEP> Criminal courts? The one of which was something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town. And that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race. The people that. The jury that's trying the officers in that case is an all white panel. <SEP> And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact. I see. <SEP> I can't. I'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one. They have. They have. They moved it up to the county north of here. It's in Ventura. And there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously. And it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that. <SEP> That videotape was just horrible. It was everywhere. And I think it would be very difficult to find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on. <SEP> I agree with you. But I can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff. The. I'm kind of torn on this issue. It's like they're saying on the one hand he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways true. But on the other hand it's also saying that white jurors are not going to convict. They're not going to do their job. Which is. The whole point of being on a jury is to convict or let go based on whether or not the evidence says that there's enough. <SEP> Based on fact. <SEP> How interesting. What's the prevailing thought within the community? What the news media is going to make of it. But what about the community? They. I guess it depends on who you talk to. I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it. But I rather imagine there's some snickering about it. And a lot of the usually fatalistic here we go again folks kind of stuff. <SEP>. That can't be good for Los Angeles either. I. On the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy. <SEP> Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles. You're going to have it just about anywhere. <SEP> There. But that's interesting. <SEP> What about the judge who's hearing the case? Is he going to be impartial? Is he going to be a good adjudicator? I don't know. And again there's something else along those lines. There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins. I don't know if it's got as much notoriety. But it's rather almost as infamous here as it was with the Rodney King problem. A girl walked into a Korean owned store. And she had a dispute black girl. <SEP> She had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the owner of the store. The owner of the store popped her. And of course they. The criminal case went up. And the judge gave the woman who shot the girl practically a suspended sentence. It was just. <SEP> She gave her no time in jail all of these things. And then we have people wondering around with petitions trying to get the judge. To get that judge recalled I would think. <SEP> That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences. It would make life easier. It would. <SEP> But. The whole world would know what you were facing. And then it's a matter of deciding.
sw4056.txt:Should begin. I can begin this. Basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis. <SEP> And the benefit program we have here is really quite good. I'm pretty pleased with it. They cover just about everything vision dental medical. You name it. And for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much. So I'm pretty satisfied myself. <SEP> What's your situation? I work for the University of New Hampshire. And our benefits package isn't quite as good in some ways. <SEP> Overall I'm satisfied with it. We don't have the vision care. We do have the health care and the dental. Are you a professor there? <SEP> I'm on the professional administrative and technical staff. And effectively I run the telephone switch at the University of New Hampshire. I see. So probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the very generous vacation time and sick time. No doubt. <SEP> We get fifteen days a year sick time. And right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year time off. That's good. That's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell is. I used to work with the Army Research Institute. And being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off. <SEP> But here you don't get that. You maybe get two or three a year. So it's really. Unless you have some vacation time or some sick leave or whatever you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time. <SEP> So that's kind of a drawback I think. But. I don't know. What do you consider most important in terms of the different benefits? I think the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit. <SEP> And the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing. I'm a little disturbed about that. But I think that's a national trend. And I don't know what the solution is to it. It's bigger than just the benefits part. I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night. They basically reviewed The Oregon Plan toward nationalizing health care and that kind of thing. <SEP>. It's kind of an interesting plan. It's kind of cold though. They've essentially made up a list of all the different medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff. <SEP> About six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by subsidized health care. And the ones above would. So it's kind of like drawing this line. And if you have it. If you don't you're kind of out of luck. <SEP> But it was kind of an interesting show. I think you're right. I think health care is probably the pressing one. <SEP> But I'll tell you I don't mind having dental. Sometimes dental costs can be just about as expensive if not more. And I know historically a lot of companies carried dental as a rider along with the medical. But I'm not sure that's widely followed any more. I'm not sure. How does University of New Hampshire handle it? <SEP> We have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental depending. And the cost between them is very little. I think it costs me something like five dollars a month for the dental plan. But it pays a substantial amount. The examinations and checkups every year or every six months are free. <SEP> And it covers the bulk of the dental expenses. Is that the same for both professors and also staff and administration. Is that generally across the board do you think. Or. It is. The benefits plan is different for what we call operating staff which are considered to be clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to. <SEP> But the main. I think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan. But the main difference is in the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued. <SEP> For the operating staff it's based on how long they've worked there. <SEP> That determines how much vacation time they get. I'm kind of interested because actually that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to teach in a university. <SEP> I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now. But. That's interesting. That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would cover and things like that. <SEP> College programs belong to this T I A A C R E F retirement fund. Is that right? And in the case of the University of New Hampshire.
sw4181.txt:I don't think anybody pays too little. I would tend to agree very highly. I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it. Do you get hit up for local taxes there? <SEP> We sure do. Here in Indiana we pay county income tax state income tax. We pay five percent sales tax. You name it they tax it. So you get the whole smorgasbord. That's right. We. I actually live in New Hampshire tax free or die. <SEP>. <SEP> Which is probably pretty nice. But I'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high. Actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either. There's no sales tax either? What there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything. <SEP> The only problem is I work in Massachusetts. So they hit me up for the five percent there. <SEP> Taxachusetts. But it. We. It's only a state tax here no local. We've got a five percent sales tax. <SEP> But the problem is that I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here. But at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me. <SEP> So that's not too bad. I really think that here in Indiana at least we pay just too much tax. I worked in a factory last summer. And on the average I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes. And I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that. I don't utilize any government welfare services. Of course I drive on the roads. And I went to the schools and stuff. But I really feel that I'm just getting overtaxed. I'd consider twenty percent lucky because when you figure out just on feds I actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year which was no fun. <SEP> That's not any fun. <SEP> And also then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A which is taxes where you. <SEP> Most people forget about them because you can't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year. And then a five percent surtax I'm paying forty percent tax. <SEP> Which is just outrageous. And a lot of it. And if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste. I think there certainly are some things where you need infrastructure. And you n-. There are things government does better. I think government does a better space program than you're going to get out of private individuals. <SEP> But I think you look at things like tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way. And just tremendous amounts of. <SEP> That's right. Got to keep those farmers happy. So much of it is now just going to service debt or is going into programs that. They are a fat. I think the military is really fat. I think that a lot of the H E W services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them. <SEP> There is just way too much bureaucracy. And so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real good programs. We. We spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals. And then you look at how well they're managed. I don't think we're getting our money's worth out of there. I think it's all going into bureaucrats. <SEP> And a lot of it's feeding that. Especially in the election year I'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and just the whole. It seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the government goes and our whole economy in general. And our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens. And especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures beyond what any other President since World War Two has done. And yet he supposedly. Between him and Reagan. <SEP> The great communicator. I just read something that two thirds or three quarters of our national debt was created during the Reagan Bush era who are supposedly fiscally conservative. They think. <SEP> And then they go and say I'm not c-. Congress they're the fault for it. But the other thing is it's tricky though. Because like in New Hampshire they say let's cut the military budget. <SEP> Then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire. You lose. Grotten Connecticut goes. So it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt. If people lose their jobs then they become a load. And they're not contributing taxes. <SEP> That's right. So it's very hard to say this is what we should cut. It's really. That is the. Especially cuts in the defense is really a Catch twenty-two double whammy because like you say if you cut defense that's great. <SEP> That's going to lower our national expenditures. But then you're going to have people on welfare. And they're not putting taxes in. Who aren't contributing. <SEP> So that's really. It's. And in our. I'm glad I'm not the one who has to come up with these policies. <SEP> But what's very funny is in our town meeting they were v-. This guy both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution for our local town to have people line item their taxes. <SEP> They say I want to pay for this and this and this and this and this. Course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use. That's right.
sw4004.txt:How do you feel about the Viet Nam war? I guess it's pretty deep feelings. I just went back and rented the movie VIET NAM. <SEP> And. I saw that as well. Got some insight there to kind of help me put together the feelings. I really appreciated the whole English class where the fellow just wouldn't do it. The guy's gouging your eyes out. What are you going to do? <SEP> What for him to finish me off. And it was good to remember that kind of Asian philosophy that. Were you ever in Viet Nam. <SEP> Or. I was kind of an in-between finally drew a high draft number. And you? I was much too young. I was born in sixty-seven. So. <SEP> Both my brothers were draft age. But neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for. Personally I just went in limbo. I had a passport and was ready to go out of the country or join special forces either one. <SEP>. <SEP> I just didn't know. So. So do you feel that it was worth what we did over there? Just a second. <SEP>. Mark what was that again? Do you think the investment in lives and money was worth it? I totally agree with that. <SEP> What effects do you think it's had on our country? Downside. The says we should go into the grief that's there. And presidents have always avoided that as a country. <SEP> So it's pretty serious really. Lot of things that aren't being addressed. I think that's pretty typical of the entire involvement over that nothing was really addressed. It was never. We announced that we were going to war. It was such a gradual and subtle increasement of force that. <SEP> Gulf of Tonkin resolution. And was it a dolphin or a torpedo. You remember that? I vaguely remember we had a spy ship torpedoed or something. Only it was foggy. And finally President Johnson said they weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo. <SEP> Isn't that something? So do you think for example in the Persian Gulf war that it seemed to me that Bush was going to extraordinary lengths to prepare the country for war. <SEP> Mark I've got to go. <SEP> We'll see you. I guess our five minutes are up according to me. Are they to you? I wasn't really keeping count. But I guess.
sw4092.txt:Music do you like? Lots of different kinds I guess. I like country music of course. <SEP> Texas. And I listen to Christian music a lot because there's a Christian music station here in our city. So I listen to it quite a bit. I am more into rock and roll myself. <SEP> And I listen cause on Friday nights they have what they call Saturday Night Alive. Or on Friday night and Saturday night and they have Christian rock and roll. So. <SEP> They have that type of music. But they just have different words. So I listen to that too. Do you like any bluegrass? <SEP> Not really. And I like rap music. At least your. <SEP> Do you like rap music? Not really. Not really. <SEP> I can tell we're together here. <SEP> We'll have to. What kind of. I have a lot of friends that like country music. <SEP> What kind of rock music do you listen to? Do you listen to that really heavy metal stuff. Or. I'm more into older rock like the psychedelic era like. Seventies and that stuff. Late sixties seventies <SEP> Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash. I have friends that like that. What? <SEP> You have never heard of the Christian music that I listen to probably. I've heard a little bit of it. I've just. <SEP> Have you heard of Carmen? Have you ever heard of Kim? I've heard of Striper. So the only one I can. Striper. They're the heavy metal stuff I guess. <SEP> The first of Amy Grant before. <SEP> Became more mainstream top forty. Cause she plays both secular and Christian. So. <SEP> I like her too. I have been to a concert a couple of times of hers. I've never actually seen her in concert. I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show. <SEP> She does. She's real good. So I like her. <SEP> I like some country music. It's just that I finding a lot of it's. I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog left me everybody's left me. <SEP> Mama got run over by the train. I don't like that. <SEP> I like Randy Travis. I like more of the real new ones. Like Garth Brooks. <SEP> Garth Brooks he's fine. Reba MacIntyre. I like them. I don't care for the older the dog left me stuff. You don't like Patsy Cline? <SEP> You don't like Patsy Cline. I don't even really know who she is. <SEP> But have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like? That music that you like to. Actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead about a week ago. But aren't they done with? I thought that they. They are still on tour. They have been touring since the late sixties. <SEP> And I just thought that they done broke up and left. <SEP> They're still together. They're still making albums. <SEP> I didn't know that. <SEP> That's interesting. In fact there are people that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that. <SEP> Cause they are on up there in age aren't they? They're late forties early fifties. But whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement. <SEP>. They seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players. They keep on dying. And they keep on replacing them. And the new one's in this thirties. <SEP> But. Cause they look pretty rough. I've seen picture of them. And they just. They don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones. They just. I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured. But it looked like leather day at the geriatric. <SEP> Cause they just. All their faces were just all shriveled. <SEP> Yuck looking. It just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans. <SEP> Are you into that rock music all that druggy stuff and all that? <SEP> You know what I am saying. They come on the stage. And you. They don't even know they are there. They are just so out of it. Actually I prefer my performers to be pretty sober just so if they're jamming that they don't just lose themselves and go into lala land. <SEP>. So I just don't like. <SEP> That. So I don't know. Have you seen any concerts lately?
sw4055.txt:Bill. Bill. Have you done much camping? <SEP> I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts. And I every month camp at least one weekend. And during the summer we camp two or three weeks a year. That sounds good. <SEP> I'd say I camp quite a bit. You do. Do you have a lot mountains. You don't have mountains in Texas do you. Where do you find places to camp? We do a lot of canoeing when we go camping. <SEP> And we also carry all our equipment with us. And so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again. <SEP>. That sounds adventuresome. <SEP> How about yourself? I've done quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and I. We have five children. And so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves. So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out. And we have gone up into the mountains and not necessarily roughed it. But we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains. That's good. And then our boys are old enough now. They're twelve and eleven. And so they're involved in the scouting. And they do a lot of camping with the scouts. <SEP> And last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week. And so this year they'll both be going. And so that's been real enjoyable for them. <SEP> What kind of camping do they like best? Do they like it where they have tents. And do they cook on stoves? They've. Actually I remember they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire. And I don't think they've taken the stoves. Last year they camped in tents. And this year I believe they will be in tents also. Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah. <SEP> It doesn't get very cold in Texas. So lots of times we don't even take tents. Is that right? <SEP> We just use trail tarps. And what does that consist of? It's just a piece of material that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent like a. <SEP> They're very light weight. And we use them when we go backpacking. So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then. They're not very heavy. <SEP> So you carry them with you. And they'll keep you dry or whatever. When we go camping here. We have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents. And I like to sleep on the air matresses. I'm not. My bones are getting so old. So I like to sleep on the matresses. <SEP> So have you had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that? In fact last month we went camping. We saw a lot of deer in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere. <SEP>. <SEP> But even though it wasn't hunting season. And we were with Boy Scouts. So of course we don't want to go hunting. <SEP> But we got to see a lot of deer out and about. And there's. Of course we see smaller animals all the time. And one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night is make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because we have armadillos. <SEP> Do you know what armadillo is? They're covered with a heavy armor type stuff. <SEP>. And possums and raccoons. <SEP> And we have those creatures down here that they like to go hunting for a midnight snack. And so that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away. But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything. <SEP> They will if you attack them. But most time they run away from you if they see you're up. <SEP> But they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep. <SEP> That sounds a little less fierce than bears. We want to.
sw4149.txt:Wendy I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that. Let me ask you the question. Do you have a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to? <SEP> Right now I'm in college. And I'm on work study. And so my budget comes from my dad's help. <SEP> He helps me out a lot. And I get paid monthly. So that's kind of hard to have a budget. My mother doesn't get paid much money. So her budget is just planning for I R A's. I see. I see. I'm kind of in a different situation. But I went through that too when I was in school. But I was working to get through college and trying to make it through that. But I'm married and have a couple of children. And we have to pretty much stick to a budget. <SEP> I'm on a salary. So I don't get any overtime or anything like that. But We have a fixed income. And we have to make sure that every dollar we have is spent accordingly. And what we try and do to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have the house payment. <SEP> We have the insurance premiums utilities and so forth. And we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside. And we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the kids' college education the future and set aside money for bonds. And we also set aside an emergency fund. Because we've been married for about ten years. <SEP> That sounds good. And we find out that no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and not enough to go and to take a loan out but you have to have money for. <SEP> And then we have. Whatever's left over is discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month. And it's worked out very well. It's helped us so that we haven't been too long on the month and too short on the money and try and stick with that. <SEP> That's good. And nice thing about it my wife is excellent in that we both work together. We both have a budget. And we stick to it. And there's no surprises in that. <SEP> With two kids that could be hard. Actually I have four kids. Four !. I said a couple of kids. I guess I should have specified. I have four little boys. <SEP>. Four boys. You bet. <SEP> You bet. It's just me and my sister. <SEP> And my parents divorced three years ago. And my sister had gotten through college. But I was still in high school. And my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together. <SEP> And then before the divorce she had saved for my college. But when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house. <SEP> So now my dad's paying for all of my college of. And financial aid and scholarships. <SEP> I'm a music major. So I have auditions coming up. What year are you in in college? I'm a sophomore. You're a sophomore. You have a few more years. <SEP> I'll probably have about two and a half years left. Good for you. Good for you. I imagine it is a little difficult to stick with a budget during school and so it forth. It sure is. I know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks. <SEP> And I don't spend over that. And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too. There's always music books to buy. Lab fees and all. <SEP> You're not a starving artist yet are you? <SEP> I don't plan on being a starving artist. That's why I'm in college. There's enough of those in the world? <SEP> I'm glad to hear that Wendy. W-. That's usually because they're not real educated. They can't afford to have a really good job. Who's not very well educated? <SEP> The starving ones. There's enough out there that if you're educated enough then you can make money. That's true. That's true. I found that out. <SEP> So that's why I'm planning and preparing for the education of my children also try and set that money aside. <SEP> What did you major in? I majored in business administration. You know plenty about planning a budget. But once again.
sw4080.txt:. What's your view. <SEP> What's your view? I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally. <SEP> That's true. Even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place. <SEP> That's right. That's right. I don't know. Coming from Texas you're probably. I don't know. I shouldn't make stereo types. But gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think. It is. But I'm not really from Texas. I just live down here now. I've lived down here a couple years. You're just live down there? <SEP> I'm originally from Colorado. But. <SEP> There's a lot of hunters here. I know how you feel. I grew up in Nebraska. And we always use to go out and hunt all the time. And. There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons. That's just. I don't know. <SEP> I think it's ridiculous. It doesn't sit with me very well. I don't know anymore. I keep a thirty-eight in my truck. <SEP> I just about all. I live in Minneapolis. And I. Actually I live in Florida. But I am staying in Minneapolis for a year. And both areas are pretty crime ridden right now. <SEP> And it's just you never know who is out there. It's just for self protection purposes. And then of course there's the hunting issue. So. <SEP> That's good. What do you do Jeff? I'm in program control for a company up here. <SEP>. We do schedules for programs schedule programs. <SEP> What do you do? I'm researcher of Honeywell up here. You guys do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything. Or. <SEP> I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here. I don't own a shotgun. But I'd like to go bird hunting. That's something I miss quite a bit. <SEP> When I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting quite a bit. But. My brother was a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and really enjoyed it quite a bit. But I don't know. I guess that what the scale now is it's zero for a complete. <SEP> One for a total ban and. That's right. I guess I am about eight or nine. <SEP> I agree with you there. No doubt about it. But. If they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't. <SEP> I'm not for it. If there's a way to limited it to people that. I guess they passed a couple of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you go to buy a hand gun. <SEP> And then they actually. I know it's this way in Florida. They have a waiting period where you buy one. And that's a week. And then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record and things like that. I think that's a pretty good idea. And that's. I don't know. That's not a bad idea. But then again you can always get around that. You could go through the black market like you say. You always be able to get around. But. <SEP> It's one of things. But I don't know. I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon. I don't either. I'm just not. I think those have been pretty much banned altogether anyway. <SEP> I. There. Fully auto. But even a semiautomatic I guess that's. It kind of takes the sport out of hunting. <SEP>. It's what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with a seven or a twenty shot twelve. You might do the same thing. <SEP> And so it's like. It does. It takes the sport out of it. For me I would much rather have a bow anytime. I like bows. I have done some bow hunting. And I get into it. And I think it's more of a challenge. <SEP> But I don't know. I guess it keeps the shell makers in business. But I don't know. Anyway that's about where I stand. <SEP> Me too. You. I am about the same way. And have you eaten yet or whatever. <SEP> Is it seven o'clock there? It's about seven fifteen. You guys central? <SEP> How is the weather up there? It's not too good. It's kind of rainy actually. Is it? Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about ten or twenty degrees. <SEP> And it's been up around forty. So people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature. Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that. So. I am just up here for the year. And it's kind of shocking.
sw4159.txt:. Mike what are your opinions on trial by jury? I work for an insurance company. So I see a lot of verdicts that are pretty crazily decided. By juries particularly. And I know in England the judges set all of the awards. Juries will decide the guilt or innocence. But then they leave the awards up to more learned people. And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous like millions and millions of dollars. That seems to make sense. But leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into kind of the rate for different. <SEP> Each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what if you will the going award should be for a certain type of case within some kind of range. When you get one way out like that. But then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after. Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. If they get some of those mega awards against them. <SEP> They're not going to sit there and lose money. If they are losing money then they're going to raise rates. They ha-. So it all comes filtering down to us all individually. <SEP> And granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged. How do you feel about setting for example some incident where someone loses a limb. Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm a dollar figure for losing different body parts? <SEP> I don't know. Some of the health insurance is written that way. That if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy it pre specified in the policy so much. But I don't know that you can necessarily put a value on somebody's limb arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases. I think maybe you look at the age of the person and their station in life and how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up with that. Maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old. <SEP> I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing. And that can be part of continuing education maybe for judges. <SEP> I don't know. To get into the economics of things. Because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away. <SEP> That's true. If it's a company you know that they're insured. Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages. <SEP> I think those should be uninsurable. I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that did the damage. Out of thei- r-. As opposed to the insurance paying the bills. <SEP>. We're. <SEP> For honest mistakes where they've done something and something happens. One of their employees causes damage or something. Who. That's what they buy insurance for. Do they get insured from other insurance companies. Or how does that work? <SEP> I was just talking about any company. Let's just say a lumber manufacturing company. You're talking about corpor-. And somebody is on the premises. <SEP> And one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift. And he pushes the wrong button. And he drops a load of lumber on somebody. And it injures them. <SEP> Insurance should pay for that. But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings. I'm not talking about any loss. I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is usually a lot less. But it's an amount designed to sting them a little. For gross wanton negligence in a claim. That. <SEP> For th-. <SEP> And unfortunately the. Lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too. So again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong. That will. <SEP> They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to. And if they know some practice is wrong. I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences. I'm talking more about the thing that they know. Maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there. And they continue to do it even after they become aware of that. <SEP> Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket.
sw4108.txt:. What do you think about putting the elderly in a nursing home? I think that it varies on the individual basis. <SEP> Sometimes there is no alternative. You do not have family available or family that's. You may not even have family who are around. <SEP> That's true. So sometimes it's not an alternative. But I think also sometimes it can be a benefit if it's for a short time. Sometimes in a nursing home. <SEP> Especially if it's after an acute illness. To get over a. Or to rehab after an illness. That's true. I never thought of that. Sometimes the nursing homes are good for just short periods of time. <SEP> That's true. Until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with. Because too often the acute hospitals are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to. <SEP> They really are. They don't like to keep them longer than a week. So there is some good to it. <SEP> Sometimes too it's used as a dumb job. The families do not necessarily know what to do with them. <SEP> What do you mean? And they don't want to take the responsibility. So they will put them in a nursing home. That's true. So. There's both sides to it too. What do you think? <SEP> And it depends on how sick the person is too. What you're capable of if you have a family to take care of of your own. I would personally like it. If my parents were to get ill I would like to take care of them at home and with some help. That's not always possible. That's true. <SEP> But to the best of my ability I'd like to do it until it gets impossible. I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to. There's not a choice because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home. <SEP>. So that option sometimes is not available if they do not have either Medicare or insurance to cover it. <SEP> That's true. But I think nursing homes can be good. It just depends on what kind they are. You need to check them out ahead of time. And then there's also some that are set up for specialties. <SEP> I know some. Unfortunately some elderly have Alzheimer's or where they wonder or confused or have some mental problem. <SEP> That they're. And you need a special nursing home for that. You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around. And you need people who are trained for that type of problem. <SEP> Who know what they're doing with that. So there's different types of nursing homes I think. <SEP> My grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it. And she really liked the idea of moving there. She's not ill yet. But she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years. And then she decided that eventually she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden. She's very independent. So she's in this nursing home. It's out in the country. And she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook. Gives her a little bit of her own independence. <SEP> But she still has a security there. Some support. And then there's also sort of a wing for those people that do get sick. And what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now. So if she ever does become ill it will be like family around her. That's right. And I've seen some of them like that too. <SEP> And also they have a lot of activities going on for the ones who are more active. <SEP> Sh-. So it's not sort of like a sick place. <SEP> She loves it. She has a great social life. And she travels. And it's in the mountains. And it's beautiful. And I hope that I have something like that when I get older. I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the elderly person who's going in and the family that's going to be effected by it. <SEP> Definitely it's. And sometimes those choices can be made in advance. And sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're. <SEP>
sw4090.txt:. Are you married. And do you have a family? I am to both questions. And do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances. <SEP> We do. We. Basically there's the expenses that are fixed during the month the ones that come every month. And we enter those into a spread sheet. And whatever is left after that we sit down and agree on kind of what sort of range we are generally going to shoot for. <SEP> I see. <SEP> What do you do? That's basically what we do. About every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget. And we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest. And then we divvy them up between our four pay checks. I work part time at night. <SEP> And my husband works full times days. And so we have four checks. But that works out nice because we get paid every week. And so that does help. <SEP> That helps a lot. And then we don't have a lot extra for extra spending. So it's pretty well ear marked. <SEP> All allocated out. Every penny is ear marked. But we have found that works the best. And so if we can just divide all the major bills up. In fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half. And divide those up between all. <SEP> All the checks. And so we are not taking a huge sum out of one. And then the next pay check we're real short. Or. We found that it's definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses. <SEP> That's true. Before we started doing that kind of a thing we were spending money for things that. We kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have. <SEP> And it was easy to let things get out of hand. We thought it to be really helpful. We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that. <SEP> So. It helps you to focus where your money goes. And I am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget. But you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in. And then you're saying where did all that money go. <SEP> That's a lot of money. But. Where does it go? <SEP> But. And also we have found that if we write down. And we did this. We are not real consistent with this. But we did it for about a month. And we wrote down everything that we bought every pay check. And so we could see where every penny went. And it was really interesting to see just what you do spend. And like I say we haven't been real consistent with it. It's. We should cause it does help. <SEP> The other thing that we've found that helps is we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit. It's just to get up the money in advance and put it in so long as it wasn't unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in an envelope or whatever. <SEP> And that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount. And then if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say it's gone. Wel- just stick to that. That is. <SEP> That sounds like a really good idea. <SEP> And it really helpful. Have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet? <SEP> We haven't. Our initial goal was just to completely retire debt for car payments and credit card debt and all of that. <SEP> We are just at a point where we could start thinking about it. So. That's good. That's a good feeling. I. My husband just graduated from the university a year ago. <SEP> So finally we are getting to that point too. A student. Are you still going to school. Or. <SEP> I am actually in the mas-.
sw4099.txt:. I guess we're talking about exercise? <SEP> First of all I have to ask you how old you are? I am twenty-seven. Twenty-seven. I am quite a bit older than you are. <SEP> But. I think exercise is extremely important. And I do exercise on a regular basis. You do? What type of exercise do you do? I do jazzercise which is an aerobic program that. You do. <SEP> Are you familiar with it? It's a national company. And we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes all day long. So you can. Are they different from aerobics. Or is it the same thing? <SEP> It's an aerobic routine. You warm up. And then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting slowly and then working up to a high heart rate. And then you gradually go down again. And you do that every day. Or. I only do it probably two or three times a week. <SEP> The minimum they want you to do is three times a week. And this is a club. Or do you belong to a group? It's really a. It's called a center. And you buy as many classes as you want to at a time. And then you just go in whenever you can. So I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings. Do you go with friends. Or do you go alone? <SEP> I go by myself. And that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me. And most of my friends that are my age don't exercise. Or they might play tennis. <SEP> And since I am not a tennis player I don't get that. But I am in my late forties. So there aren't many people that want to do that. <SEP> Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. With children between the ages. Young mothers or. Young mothers. Young women with small children are the ones that I find. <SEP> What do you do? I really don't have a routine. I like playing basketball. We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop. And that's what I do every day. <SEP>. Do you play every day? Pretty much. When my wife lets me. <SEP> Who do you play with? Do you have friends that play with you. Or just. I just shoot around by myself. And that's about it. I use to play soccer a lot in high school. But when I graduated I haven't done much. I don't have a problem. I know I have to do more aerobics. But I don't have a problem with weight. I could eat all day and not gain an ounce. <SEP> That's really good. And I think that keeps some people from exercising. I don't have a problem with weight either. But I think I don't have a problem because I exercise. You do exercise. <SEP> People are always saying to me how do you stay thin. And it's because I exercise. You do it. But I also watch what I eat. <SEP> But you'll come. Being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet. And I. But as you get older you will. Everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days. But I don't know. <SEP> It might not. Mine. Because everybody's been telling me that too. And so far it hasn't happened. And I just feel like you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get too high. <SEP> I guess I enjoy sports a lot. So that's why I've kept active in that way. But you don't play any other sports but basketball? Basketball. Volleyball. Too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby. I do that. <SEP> But do you ski? Being in Utah I was wondering if you ski. I use to. But it got too expensive. So. Did it really? <SEP> Cause I know that skiing in Utah is suppose to be great. A lot of people do that. But I never find the time. I had rather do other things. <SEP> I have never skied before. But I have friends that go to Utah all the time. And they think it's really. They come up here. And they ski. I guess there's a place where you can ski. Is it Tahoe? Where you ski from. That's Nevada to California I guess. That's in Nevada. <SEP> I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line. But. <SEP> But there is a place in Utah called a funny name. There's Snow Bird or Alta. But it's like Heavenly. Is that it? Heavenly? <SEP> I think it's called Heavenly. I've never heard of that one. You've never heard of that? <SEP> Maybe it isn't in Utah. But they said they've skied Heavenly. And it sounded like that they skied really well when they are actually talking about a place. It's kind of funny. Do they exercise much for skiing? I know when I went you can get sore easily. But. <SEP> You can get really sore. I know you. I've talked to people. But most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore. Is one or two timer a year if I do go on them. And I am really sore after. And then is it your quadriceps that are the worst? <SEP> In your legs and. My legs really really ache. But that's. I am using muscles that I have never used before. <SEP> And it's strange that you can do I did aerobics all the time. And then I went horseback riding. And still I was so sore. And I couldn't get over.
sw4154.txt:What do you feel about the present situation in the Mideast? It looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is. <SEP> What do you think Mark? I agree. I think there's definitely been some changes. And I think the end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on the situation. In that. Basically since the end of World War two there was always that little proxy war going on. With the U S funding Israel and the Soviet Union funding the Arab countries. <SEP> And then we'll see what happens when they're not funded quite as much. Or supplied with arms the same way. <SEP> But on the same token Israel has lost a lot of their value to the U S in being the foothold of capitalism. In the Mideast. <SEP> We tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves. We kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them. <SEP> But I think one of the most interesting things to me recently during the war in Kuwait was the fact that they did not retaliate for the scud missiles that were launched there. <SEP> That just seemed to me to be a phenomenal demonstration of restraint. And it must have reflected some awful good diplomacy on the part of the U S. But on the other hand if they would have had a hard time retaliating because they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes. I see. They would have had to fly through two enemies. <SEP> You don't think they got the codes from the U S already? The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them. I see. Of course public statements can be taken for. <SEP> That's true. They can yet they. D-. <SEP> What do y-. What about this situation with the continual harassment by Iraq right now and apparently failing to let the arms inspectors have free access. To begin with. I pretty much question what the U S -s motives were in actually the original involvement. I. The cynical side of me says that it was more for the domestic political situation than for anything else. And for portraying Bush is a strong President. <SEP>. My gut feeling is that he pretty much picked the fight with Hussein. <SEP> I'm not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to enter that fight. But I think that we chose to have our official feelings hurt. <SEP> Where a lot w-. Do you think that we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and move on into Kuwait and see what happens? <SEP> I think that in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen. And I really don't think that. I think there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests. <SEP> May have been. I'm not saying that that's not the case. And along this line since it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait. <SEP> I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and in fighting a second battle. Over what probably won't accomplish much for him politically. <SEP> It doesn't look like we're getting ready to do much more in there. Even at this point. <SEP> What about. Do you have any views on Israel's relation to the U S? Do you think we ought to back off on our support of the country. <SEP> Or what do yo-. I have very fixed feelings about Israel. I think that for a long while we've had almost a ha- t-.
sw4123.txt:Jimmy how do you get most of your news? I watch the national news every day for one. I also read one or two papers a day. And I'm pretty much a news junkie. And I tune in to C N N a lot. When you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when? <SEP> Every evening at six thirty. I watch the national news. I would probably be a junkie or watch C N N a lot. But I don't subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also because. I give to the United Way. And so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that. <SEP> As opposed to paying for cable. I take away a addiction. Something. <SEP> I. Overall I. The quality of the news you get off of most sources is pretty low. It's. Usually you get pretty incomplete coverage. And that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible. Because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on. You would hope. But still hard to say that what you've heard is what really is. <SEP> What newspapers do you read? I read the local newspaper. And I also try and read one of the major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that. For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES actually a couple of newspapers because my fiance. She was unemployed for a while. So she really needed to look at the help wanted ads. <SEP> And so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news. And I don't know. NEW YORK TIMES is okay. And when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so. But they say it's like the sixth grade reading level. <SEP> But I swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes. <SEP> Pretty low. But I don't know. I think if you listen to N P R or something like. <SEP> I really like N P R a lot. That's pretty good. And I like listening to that on. When I get a chance when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it because I. I miss N P R a lot also. I really like them because they give. Instead of being as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which I think is good. <SEP> And they also. Their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than your major network news and that kind of thing. McNeil and Lehrer. I guess he's leaving. One of them is leaving. They're pretty good too. I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot. <SEP> Had that invasion or whatever it is. Sure was. But I don't know. I guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype. Look at the Smith trial. <SEP> That was a joke. That was. But then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good. The N P R doing that. I know. I had some visitor. And he was just fixated on that just listened to it constantly. <SEP> And I guess that's good when it's live if you'll really want that. But that's not really providing you news. It's more like a media event rather than reporting. <SEP> But the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while. That's kind of boring to me I think. <SEP> It is really kind of boring. But that's. If you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report somebody else's view about it. And that's what you're supposed to. If you watch the news your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion which I would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's. I guess that's true. But one of the ways that I get information is every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing. It's free inside the company. It's called INTELLECT. And they basically type out abstracts which are really literally. I've actually read the actual articles. They're pretty g-.
sw4153.txt:. I used to work in a day care center. I worked in all the different areas of the day care center. And they can be deceiving to people. I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the treatment that the children got. And this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three centers all over the city. <SEP> And they would be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left. I think if you do day care centers you should make frequent checks to check in on them when they're not expecting it. <SEP> Because they do do things differently when you're not around. So. That. I know wh-. The things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have. And how many kids they have and how they break it up. <SEP> Because we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in. <SEP> It was a really good one. And in fact it worked out for us because we kind of bartered. My wife did artwork for them. So we got our day care free. But they didn't have enough teachers. And. This one was set up good. They had two teachers to every room. Sometimes three. <SEP> And they had a good system so when you walked in everything looks cool. The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough. They did not show them care to these small children who are being left. <SEP> They. One time I picked up this little boy who was crying. And the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. He said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up. <SEP> And I said no. This child was crying and needed some comfort. What is your problem. <SEP> Did did they separate them by age group? Because I think that's one thing that was important. They did they had the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room. <SEP> Then they had the three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives. Just like that. They really did separate them well. <SEP> It sound. It was just the teachers themselves. It sounds like to me your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people. Affectionate people that they're may be parents themselves or something. <SEP> But. That they're not. Their system. <SEP> But their system was great. But the caring just wasn't there. The one woman that did the babies. I worked with her. And she was fabulous. <SEP> She loved them babies. And she loved them and cared for them. But every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and would make me a nervous wreck. I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and know all the technical stuff. But if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good. These kids are just in a day care center all day and with no any type of emotional getting love getting care. <SEP> They're just there. Going through this routine which is lousy. <SEP> An-. The other group that we had was kind of interesting. The other one we went to it was a husband and wife team. <SEP> And we knew them from other associations. But it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one. And I think she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff. But he was actually the more demonstrative type. The more loving. He would laugh with the kids and play with the kids. And it was kind of interesting to see that it was actually the man in the group that did that side of it. <SEP> An-. You don't see that much. So they had a really nice balance. We liked that one. In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something. That's cute. <SEP> But they also did some of the teaching things. And then they had. Obedience was important. That has to be with a day care center. So I think they used the. You probably heard where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself. I've never heard of that. That's a new one on me. <SEP> And it's one. I can't remember what they call it actually. But you just stand them in front of a clock. And it has a second-hand that goes around. <SEP> And they have to stand there.
sw4104.txt:. How about you. What do you do with your budget? What do I do. At the moment it's under chaos. Right now I'm just. I don't really have a budget per se. It's called living within your means. Which means at the moment paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse. <SEP>. That's true. But. I don't really have a budget at the moment. But I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month. And then I usually don't exceed that unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if I have car expenses. And then it goes through the moon. So. <SEP> That's sort of a problem. What do yo-. We're trying to. So far we are in the clear credit wise. But the other side of it is. So not much on that side of it to add to it. We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that. But. So you can afford to get a house? <SEP> We'd like to do that some day. We have this dream. <SEP> But we don't know how long it will be a dream. We're real happy that we don't have any debt. But at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this economy right now. So we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save the little bit that we do get on top of expenses every month. <SEP> What do you and your husband do? We're missionaries actually. Are you really? <SEP> And it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have support quota. And it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here. <SEP> And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home. I see. Overseas where would you be going? <SEP> Africa. Nigeria. How long would you be there? <SEP> About four years. We're career. So we go over seas for four years. And then we come back for a year. We go over four. We come back for a year. With what Church? We're with Wycliff Bible Translators. <SEP> I know who they are. They have an office in Costa Mesa as I recall. They could very well. And. There was a fairly large building that belongs to them. Are you active in translation? <SEP> We will be. I was over four years doing language surveying which is the first step. You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need. And came home and got married. And we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family. And it is easier to raise a family as translators. I always wanted to do translation. But as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier. They really need surveyors cause you're free to travel anywhere. You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff. True. True enough. What languages do you speak besides English of course? <SEP> I have a smattering of about ten different ones. But there's. I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other. Since I did complete a survey in one area I'd switch to the other. So I know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff. <SEP> But in about five I can do better in it. And my French is pretty good. But it's French. So I'm terrified to speak in France. In France. Because they're real snobby about their language. And French is street French. And I just picked it up off the street. And I knew what I was communicating. But I didn't know what I was saying. I never sat there and got a direct translation. And said something here when I came home and French to somebody. And he paled and said I'm not going to tell you what you said. So since then I have refrained from speaking any French. <SEP> In. I don't know what I said to him. But I didn't ask him either. Must have been terrible. The. Was it Henry Macon said that the language was like a man slowly bleeding to death. So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die. And it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that. Free style English is just. Takes on.
sw4019.txt:Chuck do you have any pets there at your home? I do. And what kind do you have? <SEP> I've got a male Siamese about a year old here. I live alone in an apartment except for the cat. <SEP> How about you? We have a cat. He's probably a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby. How's the disposition of your Siamese cat? <SEP> It's they're just aggressive by nature. And he's been neutered and declawed. So he's an indoor cat. <SEP> So that kind of calms him down for the most part. How about yours? He has been really aggressive especially towards my little girl for some reason. <SEP> He's been so mean to her. And you say you've had him how long? We've had him for about two years. <SEP> Two years. And he was so mean to her right after we first got him. We had him neutered and declawed. And now he bites her. He can't scratch her any more. He bites her. <SEP> Does he bite her enough to draw blood? He has a couple of times. So. But he's a very possessive cat. He loves my son. It's his cat. And he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him. <SEP> And he's so funny. He just follows my son around just like a dog. He won't even let my son shower. <SEP> He meows and wants to get in the bathroom. And while he showers it's so hilarious. So he's quite a animal. I guess. As long as he doesn't get too aggressive. With the daughter he's all right. <SEP> You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something. We did actually take him to the pound a couple of times because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl. <SEP> But he seems to have mellowed out a little bit. And we do keep our daughter away from him. So. Were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house. <SEP> Is that the only pet that you have? It is. We tried a dog about four years ago and we ended up with malamute and some other kind of mix. Anyway it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home. So we gave him up and tried. Do you live in a house or a place where you. We're in a house. But we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog. <SEP> I see. We couldn't allow him to run free. So he was just chained up all the time. And it was unfortunate. Have you tried any other pets? <SEP> I live alone in an apartment. And it's not that big that. Although I've heard rabbits are pretty good. <SEP> I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses. <SEP> And they apparently. Especially when they're young when they bring them in. And do they just paper train it or something? <SEP> I guess. I guess. And I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either. Rabbits are darling. That would be fun if you could get them trained. Otherwise they're pretty smelly. <SEP> That's right. Did you see the dog show. We don't have cable. <SEP> I see. They have the Westminster Dog Show. I think it's in New York City at the Gardens. There once a year live. And they had that on last week. And that's really kind of something to watch. <SEP> It's on two or three nights for maybe an hour or two. Is that right? And some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there. <SEP> Some of them are really beautiful too. I'd be interesting to watch. <SEP> You live in Utah do you? Elton. We live out here it's by Ogden. It's north of Salt Lake City Utah. <SEP> And we really love it out here. It's kind of country. We're only about ten minutes from Ogden. So we're kind of country but not too. <SEP> Do you all work for T I or for. Do you? I'm getting so many calls to Texas. <SEP> This is the very first one I've talked to. I've been doing it for about two weeks. And No my.
sw4060.txt:Karen. You're first. I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. Not to get in a dead end job. <SEP> And plus for me it's medical and benefits and dental. They're also important. I guess one of the differences I see is working for a university there is room for advancement but not so much so in quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association. <SEP> So there is a progressive path. But not being in the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people really. <SEP> Are they pretty much train for a specific job. And that what I hired for and then just very little variation from that. Somewhat that. But then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances. So that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution. It's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance. <SEP> And I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business. But I agree the medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the security aspect for long term employment. That's interesting though. Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore. I use to think that after you work. You mean job security? Job security. <SEP> That use to be a couple of years ago. But I don't know if it is so much anymore. In fact we just had a lay off in November. But it wasn't necessarily. Some people had been there a long time. We are seeing that here as well. In some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs. <SEP> I think it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do. <SEP> No doubt. But. And institutionally like here at the university if there is a cut back it's not where it's needed. It's where it's most expedient which in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles. <SEP> Expedient. That's exactly it. Where it cuts back the most. <SEP>. We. I think that's one of the things too. You get too many management people. It's very easy. <SEP> And it's very easy for them to say this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done. And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time. Those people aren't there anymore. Because it's support people that are providing the speed for it. <SEP>. <SEP> But. What else do you think is important? The. That's maybe the majority of the importance I guess. Because my perspective is from an institution. There is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe. <SEP> But if you're in the corporate world there is considerable motivation for innovation. Although the more complex your structure the less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through. But I think it's a long term type of process where in a small organization things can happen much more quickly. And so you can see the reward of the efforts. <SEP> I think probably in a small. I was going to say it's more personal for one thing. You probably have a better team cooperation or team playing atmosphere. Probably where as in a bigger corporation I think you're just a number. You end up being your own person. <SEP> And if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up then that's their problem. And you really. <SEP> Whereas in a smaller. I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished. It becomes the organization instead of person being a part of the individual themselves.
sw4032.txt:Martin do you do any exercise? I do. I like to play basketball and weight lifting. Those are probably the two main things I like to do. So those are more or less indoor sports. How's the weather out there in Georgia? <SEP> In the winter typically it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis. I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall. <SEP> But in the winter it gets pretty cold. So it's mostly indoor sports in the winter. <SEP> How about yourself? I'm on a exercise program. I'm riding my Aerodyne bike half an hour every morning. And I'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning. And I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time. It's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise. <SEP>. Do you do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise? First of all I'd like to get my weight off. I'm about fifty pounds overweight. And so I'd like to get the weight off. And then I'd really like to get into that. <SEP> And my husband and I have a aerobic video that's called The Firm. I don't know if you've heard of it. But it's an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down. But you're using weights. And that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done. It's really fun. <SEP> It's similar to aerobics with weights. But it's like low impact aerobics just with weights. <SEP> Are you familiar with step or bench aerobics? I am. But I have never done it myself. Have you done that? <SEP> I have. In Atlanta that's. Most of the health clubs are all. That's the in thing. That's the big thing? <SEP> At first it was just regular aerobics. But now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over. So how is that? <SEP> They call it a low impact aerobics. And it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time. And from when I've done it it does give you a real good workout. <SEP> But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees that and movement of going up on the step that could create a problem. <SEP> They seem to think that it won't. But you never know. If playing basketball are you knees. Do you have healthy knees? <SEP> I think my ankles probably are my main weak point. But I've kind of taken care of that. I wear high tops and then also a support ankle brace which is very stiff. <SEP> And wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so. That's good. You sound just like my husband. He injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball. And he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy. <SEP> I. So that's what he does. He wears his brace and his high tops. And. I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy. <SEP> It would only take three or four days. And I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way. <SEP>. <SEP> So how successful is your exercise video? It is amazing how fast you take off the inches. And I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week. And then every other day I'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day. <SEP> But it is really amazing how fast the inches come off. And the muscle builds real fast. You can start. They recommend doing the video without weights for the first month. And then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your twenty-five pound dumbbells. <SEP> And then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video. And it's a hour long video. So. So it's a good workout. It is. I really enjoy that. So I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy. <SEP> So in the winter there's a lot of. It's quite cold and snow. <SEP> This one has been quite mild. We could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground. It was quite chilly. But not.
sw4174.txt:. Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is in the situation of choosing college. <SEP> She's actually at Bible College for this current year. And I guess first and foremost really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then which colleges or universities can best offer that program. And then it comes down to the dollar. You have to. It's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction. Or it does. <SEP> It comes down to trying to come with a trade off of the costs. <SEP> What do you feel about come of the things that need to. I agree pretty much with everything you've said. The one thing that I'd advise any parent or any person looking for a college is that I think it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the actual students there. Because they're just in my experience. I've talked to people at other colleges that. The lifestyle pictured in the catalogs isn't always the whole story. Y-. The college. The catalogs are sales material. <SEP> It doesn't matter whether they're selling school. <SEP> And. It really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school. I guess there's a difference in. Here the. At least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily off campus resident students. <SEP> They just live in the community. I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is right on campus as well. <SEP> And that changes the character of it quite a bit. I go to Georgia Tech which is primarily an engineering school. <SEP> And I think I really do miss the fact that it's not a university that there's not the. It tends to be a very conservative school. And there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of universities will have. I guess we're here. This is the university that has for years had the car that will travel the farthest on a small quantity of gas. Our engineering students. <SEP> In competitions. And that's the kind of thing that also if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school. In one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a spirit of producing graduates. <SEP> As sort of some development and some training. It's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them. <SEP> And that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to what the attitude towards achievement is. Do you have anyone that you're seriously needing to feed information to? I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that. I don't really know of anyone that's looking for colleges now with the exception of people's younger brothers and sisters. Then the only advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech. <SEP> But. Actually I'm more interested in choosing the right job when you graduate type information. <SEP> That's really a valid point that people need to consider as well. <SEP> To. Going to university is going to take four to eight years depending on the programs person's involved in. Program. And after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself. <SEP> And if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market. If that's. Like a fine arts education. I. <SEP> Best training in the world is not going to put food on your table. But.
sw4051.txt:You want to start? I might as well. One of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution is the ozone layer issue. I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons. And that rather bothers me that I was in effect contributing to the delinquency of the environment so to speak. That's stuff we never even thought about three years ago. <SEP> And one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen was because they were inexpensive. They could be made inexpensive and lots of it. And in that and its properties were great with the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to get your heating and cooling cycles to work. So. Have they stopped that practice now? <SEP> Course there's a tremendous number of refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential utilizing freon twelve. And of course the new cars starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems. But there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera. And that's got me very highly concerned that that's going to be quite a while before we can undo this. <SEP> That could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession. But you got to have people that can earn a salary to pay for this conversion. So I see us in somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless the banks or industry or the government go together and come up with a way to have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting compound. <SEP> Because as I say there's a tremen-. How many families own a refrigerator. And then do that number and then how many a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning. <SEP> There are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks. And the only reason I didn't get into that more when I had my little business was because most of your air conditioning on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree. And. <SEP> So that's why I stayed more towards. And that's a polluting type deal too is the excessive petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with water really make a mess. I hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that's putting out a lot of dark smoke. And I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars. <SEP> But that particular bothers me. Most of the time when you see the busses with the diesel those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor. <SEP> Because when diesel is burned it's it. Diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine. It's burned so completely that you don't have any nitrous oxides or oxides of nitrogen to form by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is not very volatile. Where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone. <SEP> Diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily. And it's got. Its latent heat is high. But it's slow burning at normal pressures. That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the air is heated by virtue of the compression process to one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio. I see. <SEP>. <SEP> And so if the car sucks in fifty degrees.
sw4049.txt:I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in very specific examples such as transportation workers as in air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing. I don't really think that it's too many. I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're worthy of working for us. I really don't see that that's a very valid thing for a company to say. And personally I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body. <SEP> I guess I basically agree that. Do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs? Suppose they found out some other way? I think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs. There's too many cases where it can. There can be false positive results and that sort of thing. I don't think there's any definitive. This person is taking drugs. So we don't want him here. <SEP> Like I said some industries though I think it'd be very necessary. I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane. But I find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal. If your employer's not going to trust you. Or it. I think it's a whole trust issue. I just can't see it. <SEP> But have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested. Or. I have been. I was very offended by the whole process. <SEP> I once too. It's very humiliating. And I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs. But I am totally against that sort of a. It's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you. <SEP> I had it during a job interview. And I just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them to do this. And I'm just I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me. <SEP>. That's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just. I was in the same sort of situation as. It was a job interview. And then you had a physical where you were drug tested. And it's. I just. And I know people who have been drug tested and who have not been hired by a corporation which. I really. The other side of it is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy it's my bodily fluid. And I don't really want you to look at it or something pretty basic like that. <SEP> Just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work. During the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there I think they have every right to say these behaviors are acceptable and these are not. But when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work I find that to be fairly offensive also. Like you say if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors. <SEP> And if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons. That's exactly right. <SEP> And also I just think it gets a lot. I'm a big supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies. And I think that it just moves down along a line that I really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work. There's already talk of people. We're not going to hire you if you smoke. I can see how they can say in the work place you don't want them to smoke. But when somebody leaves work I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all. <SEP> Do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this. Or. I really think it should be except in the specified industries or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times. And other than that I do not think it should be allowable. I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that. It's kind of the big brother syndrome. I just. Anything like that just kind of scares me. <SEP> I tend to view it. Even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that I sort of want to defend an employer's rights in addition to an individual's rights. But an employer really has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to. And if they say they don't want smokers I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that. <SEP> And I don't really.
sw4184.txt:You have any pets? Do I have pets? <SEP> I have a cat. And I have two dogs. Two dogs. What kind? I have a Schnauzer. And I have a Sheltie. Schnauzers. Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer? <SEP> It's a miniature. I'm going into all this because I just got done working at a pet shop. <SEP>. The Schnauzer I'm watching for one of the managers where I work. And he's been transferred to Germany for a while. <SEP> And I'm taking care of his dog. And I had just got the kitten when he asked me that. And he says my dog doesn't like cats. And I said we won't tell her it's a cat because it was a kitten. <SEP> And they just love kittens. They just are fascinated. <SEP> So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet. That's good. They say. <SEP> And they get along real good. I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip. So that was interesting. Didn't expect that would happen. That's cool. That's nice. Let's see. What was the other dog you had? <SEP> It's a sheltie. A sheltie. She's real sweet little dog. She's got a very nice temperament. They're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer. <SEP> The Schnauzers are a little aggressive. They can be nippy. Shelties are nice. Everybody seems to be really happy with them. They're good temperament. <SEP> They're a good temperament. They put up with a lot. And they just. I think they have a good head on their shoulders. I think they have a higher level of intelligence than other dogs that I have encountered. Schnauzers in particular probably. <SEP> But also some poodles. <SEP> They're kind of. There are some smart ones out there. But there's also some not so smart ones. I g-. It seems the smaller the are the worse off they are. Maybe there's some credence in that statement. They're bred down so much. It's. <SEP> They aren't the best pets. I really don't know what the best pet is. <SEP> I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal. Some people seem fairly well suited for miniature poodles and such. And bull dogs. <SEP> But I don't know about these. Pit bulls that are so vicious. Pit bull. <SEP> They might. They're actually very friendly dogs. Are they really? I don't think I've ever seen one. They're really nice. <SEP> I've dealt with quite a few of them. Customers that bring them into the shop and ask me they fit collars and stuff on them. And they are just really nice really friendly kind of medium intelligence. How do they become s-. W-. How did they get their reputation then? Because some people want to train them as. <SEP> They train them to be that way then. You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way. <SEP> It takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond. So the poor animal is doing it in self protection. <SEP>. They aren't by nature really nasty critters. They are very determined critters. <SEP> And so once you get them going it's not good to deal with but I really like them. I was impressed by them. They're real sturdy little critters. And they aren't that big. And just really friendly. <SEP> That's unusual. I was overwhelmed. I. <SEP> I suppose you were surprised. <SEP> After the reputation that. Right now. They have quite an notable reputation as far as. They picked up a lot of bad press lately. <SEP> They're banned in some areas I understand. But any pet can be bad if you train it to be that way. <SEP> That. They must have just targeted that breed and said we're going. It's when. In my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret attacking a child in a house. <SEP>. These people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret. The ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild. <SEP> And they should expect something like that to happen. And so bas-. Now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town. Did it attack the child then? It bit him. <SEP> And that was not a good thing. But I think it was probably an individual ferret thing because it was a fairly wild ferret. The people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that. They hadn't. <SEP> They really should have expected it. And taken the precautions. <SEP> They didn't. It's too bad it happened though. <SEP> Because then the animal's in trouble and not the person.
sw4013.txt:So you have eight children. What type of things do you do as a family to spend time together. We spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling going to the park some time watching V C R movies generally cheap things. <SEP>. We know how that goes. With lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation. <SEP> That's right. That's fun. So let's see. Some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot. And you may think this is funny. But one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek. And we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark in our house. And that is so fun. The kids just get a crack out of that. We do like to go to the park too like your family. We don't do a lot of vacationing. Have you taken a lot of vacations together. Or. <SEP> Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa. And whe-. We get an occasional one or two day thing. <SEP> But most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa. Where do they live? In Arizona. So that's a bit of a drive for you there. <SEP> So you like to go there for the holidays. And. We don't go very often for holidays. Generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us. <SEP> What are the ages of your kids then? They range from twenty-four to five. So you have some in the nest and some out. <SEP> That's right. How old are your children? We have. Ours start at twelve. And then they go down to four. <SEP> I think the hardest thing for us is to find leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have. I bet. The older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing. <SEP> But the young kids don't understand it. And so they get real frustrated when we try to do that. And. And then if you want to play something on the little kids' level then the older kids get real bored. And they want to do something else. So. <SEP> I can relate to that. Do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one? I think it's improving actually. <SEP> We had an interesting experience the other day. We have pretty much a routine that we spend. We don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday. And we just kind of keep them at home. <SEP> And our next door neighbor. We were at a soccer game Saturday. And our next door neighbor was there. And somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house. And she said Sunday's our family day. <SEP> And we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them. That's good. And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now. <SEP> I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction. And I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now. I think so. And I feel like President Bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation. And it does begin with the families at home. <SEP> And so I'm a firm believer in that too. I think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something. So. That's true. We see that a lot out here in Utah. And hopefully it's going to spread. <SEP> Utah's a lot better than Texas. Do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas. Or. Very few. Very few. You feel like you're in the minority? <SEP> When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense. <SEP> But. Out here in Utah five is about the average. Average. <SEP> My wife and I were in Utah until we were about twenty-four. <SEP> Never been back since then. But We have kids up there now. So we get up occasionally. I have some relatives out there in Texas. In fact my mom's out there in Texas right now in Dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch. And. <SEP> Where in Dallas? I'm trying Aberdeen? Is that close to Dallas? <SEP> I don't have any idea. I've never heard of it. Must be a little town. Don't you. <SEP> I guess it's out there clear out. They have a ranch that has five hundred acres. And.
sw4133.txt:My feeling is that it's really being used today. It really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal. I think I've seen some statistics that say that it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. Because you've got all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses. <SEP> And it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. For one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible really care. That's. Committing them mostly is either crimes of passion or at the moment. Or they think they're not going to get caught. Or. It's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon. I'm invulnerable. I don't need to care about this. I'm never going to get caught. <SEP> B-. But you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like Jeffrey Dahlmer. Do you want. By putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again. One way or another. <SEP> Whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility. But the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison and somehow redeem himself. <SEP> I don't think he could ever redeem himself. But in some cases. So that. The other problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent? There are cases where twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then. I'm sorry. Guess we killed the wrong guy. <SEP> It's. Once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it. You can apologize nicely. But I think the price. It's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned. Is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works. It's a-. The benefit of the doubt to the last iota is based on the person who is accused. And I think that. And the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush. Where are we going to impose d-. It's like for drug dealers is the new big thing in. Tsongas is also saying make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer. <SEP> And again I don't thing these people care. They risk their lives every day. And they seem that the profit margin's so high that the risk is almost not there. <SEP> And especially now I live in Massachusetts. We're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something. But you look at our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to Texas or someplace that does it's impossible to make a case that it's affecting it in any way. <SEP> I think it's mainly people they get the vengeance of it. It's also. Because. <SEP> I used to live in Georgia. And the big thing down there was we have capital punishment. But if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related. It's lot of blacks. Also a lot of young people. A sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen. <SEP> And I think when you listen to the victims' families and things they're always talking about feeling justified or feeling like they've gotten something out of it. My thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the victim's family. The only thing that should really. Obviously if someone of mine who has close died I'd probably feel differently. But the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society. <SEP> And that. And also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility of making restitution. The. You will work your prison job. And any money you earn will go to the victim's family. And the other thing is that I was reading through a book on human geneo research. <SEP> And there more and more things like schizophrenia. And why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin. So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say the problem is you've got an endorphin imbalance. And if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society. <SEP> You really get back to the question of is someone responsible for their actions. I think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions. I never liked the insanity defense. Society made me do it. <SEP>
sw4171.txt:Do you happen to be working for a large firm? It's about three hundred and fifty people. I guess that's not large compared to some. But it's big enough. <SEP> And they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything. And I wish they did. They have a four O one K. But I put all the money into it. <SEP> They don't add anything. What about you? I work for a fairly large company. It's got eight thousand people. And we do have health insurance. We don't have four O one K plan stuff like that. But we do have retirement. They kind of match up to you. If you put six percent they match up to six percent. And then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that. <SEP> That's a pretty good deal. It's not bad. Now how long does it take for your contribution to vest? I don't know. It's probably a long time. I'm sure it's not till twenty-five years thirty years. <SEP> The place I work at's health insurance is kind of expensive. It's hundred bucks a month or something for a family. I guess what we have is what they call a flex benefits plan where you get a certain amount of dollars. And then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need. Otherwise guess you can hold money back and then either use or lose it or can just have that money put in your paycheck. <SEP> We have one of those use it or lose it plans too where they'll basically pay for child care type expenses. I can send in a request for payment. And they'll send me a check for the amount they withheld. That's pretty good. It saves a third off on taxes or something. It depends on which company you work for. I know that the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is plan D. Deductibles are really high. It's fifteen hundred dollars. But if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because if you're relatively healthy then it's really unlikely that you'd use that amount of money. So someone did start a cost benefit analysis. And ends up the best is to take a high deductible and take a loss whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual. I guess. On the other hand I had a similar health plan. And one of my kids was in a car accident. And I wound up having to pay for a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because no insurance policy happened to cover it which is. <SEP> You mean not even your car insurance? It got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here. And I had a high deductible on the car insurance. And then we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it. That's too bad. <SEP> I don't know. I think other than health insurance an extra week of time off would be nice. I only get two weeks. My place you get two weeks when you start. And then every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks. That's nice. We don't get them till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week. <SEP> That's a long time. It's. <SEP> Especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in companies don't stay afloat that long. And they. With the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used to be much more stable. It's a lot less stable than it used to be. They used to have job security crap. But now they don't. You work for Bell or something like that? It's the Bell Corps which is. <SEP>. I don't know. It's no longer. That's what. I think it's still based on the old model of. And now they don't. <SEP> A lifelong job security. Telephone pioneers of America. All that stuff. But they no longer. <SEP> I don't think so. Hearing a lo-. They're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security. <SEP> Does it. They must have pretty good severance though? I don't know. We haven't been doing layoffs. We've been doing down sizing with getting rid of extra layers of management. And I don't know what they do for those people. Mean the management they get rid of? Some of it. <SEP> There's too many chiefs and not enough Indians. But. They put.
sw4050.txt:. I pressed the button one. So we're recording right now. I'm sorry. That's okay. I'm Bill from Raleigh. <SEP> And I'm Melanie from Harrisville Utah. Another one from a different state besides Texas. Bill we're talking about family reunions. <SEP> Have you ever had to plan a family reunion? It wasn't really a planning one. But it was a birthday. And I brought a lot of family together then. <SEP> And how did you feel it went? It went pretty good. I've worked in hotels. So I kind of know how to do these things. I used to. <SEP> All this planning and getting together and such. Let's see what else. Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday. And it's all of she comes from a big family. She has seven sisters I think. <SEP> They show up and all their kids. And then all she has. I have. Let's see. She has four sons and two daughters. And they show up and all their kids. So it's a pretty big reunion. It's about two hundred people maybe. <SEP> What did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together? Probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone could eat comfortably and everything. I guess probably the most helpful thing was that for the rent we rented a rescue squad building or something like that. <SEP>. And everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for soft drinks. And so nobody really got stuck with the bill. <SEP> That's good. And each person in the family brought a dish or something. <SEP> And then did you have a main meal. Or did everyone just bring. It was just pot luck. It was kind of pot luck. Everybody brought their specialties I guess you would say. <SEP> Show off a little bit. And of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook. <SEP> How old is she? She's eighty-six. Is she pretty spry is she pretty. She does. She looks probably like she's in her early sixties. <SEP> And if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact. <SEP> That's neat that she's in good health at that age. My nickname for her is Honey Woman. That's what I call her. That sounds fun. I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago. And there were. We sent out five hundred announcements because our family is quite large like your family there. And so that was a real challenge. And I was president of our family reunion for two years. And I wasn't very at that duty for two years in a row. But I found that advance planning was the key to success. Also one thing that's helpful. And I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever. <SEP> But all my family lives in the same county. So. That's wonderful though. But it's just kind of like get on the telephone. And it's so and such days from such and such date. <SEP> And everybody just shows up. <SEP> That is helpful. Our family ranges from Australia to Boise Idaho and all kinds of places. I would say you're spread out then. We are. My immediate family my parents and my brothers and sisters I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever. Because my dad was in the Army. And we're pretty strung out all over. <SEP> But since they've moved back to Carolinas we still are the only ones do not live in Yantsen County. In. <SEP> I live in Raleigh. And then my parents live in Greenville. And I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and another brother that lives outside of Fayetteville. So we're spread out. But everybody else is centralized in my home town Waynesboro. <SEP> So. Nobody moves away except us. <SEP> They must really like it there. I got out as soon as I graduated. Just this town is too small for me. <SEP> You're ready to move on to bi-.
sw4138.txt:Think about taxes. I think they're a necessary evil. I wish the government would operate on the same premise that businesses operate on. And that is you don't spend more than you bring in. You spend what you have. And. <SEP> I think that the general idea is to spend during a time of recession for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy. But they're running under the assump-. The way they're running it now they're running it under a deficit spending while we're not under a recession. So there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running. So that's kind of a basic thing of economics keep spending keep going into debt. You're not going to payoff what you owe. So I guess the question was more like do you get what you pay for. I. It just depends. Roads are very expensive commodity and so is utilities they supply and police and fire department. They need to make a living. There's. <SEP> So I think for many years we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are to a great extent public servants we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society. I agree with that. <SEP> But then again it's hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments. I guess. I'm a student right now. And I don't make a whole lot of money. And so I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes compared to what I get because all my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school. And my education all up through high school and stuff. So I guess I'm kind of in debt because I don't been paying taxes all that long. My parents however have contributed to that for the education side of it and everything. But I usually end up getting money back. I will this year anyway from a. You're very fortunate. I am. <SEP> I need it too. Otherwise. We just try not to pay any more in than we have to. We pay in a substantial amount. <SEP> We don't regret paying taxes. We do think that sometimes we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax. And progressive tax does not give people incentive to make more money. And what I mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay. More taxes you pay. <SEP> It should be a flat percentage. And that percentage ought to be an equitable amount. Isn't. Last year when they passed the tax laws for the nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else. <SEP> And I totaled them all up. And basically we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax. <SEP> That was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there even though there's taxes on different things. Isn't. <SEP> But there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying. Like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax. There's a lot of hidden taxes. You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your tank. <SEP> The taxes that people don't think about that. The income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay I guess. But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes. There was that. <SEP> Which can-. Was it Jerry Brown. One of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the tax codes they have now and implementing a flat percentage something like that. If you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people to make more money. And what people need to understand in my opinion is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes. <SEP> And so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs. That's because until eight. <SEP> And so. Based on that who do you think you're talking to. You're talking to an employer. <SEP> Up until eighty-five or something was the.
sw4038.txt:I guess it took. I guess the recording has started now. <SEP> Have you ever served on a jury? I served. I was in the Air Force and served on a court martial board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury. A lot of the same rules apply. Have you ever served on one? I finally served on one last year. I've been voting for years. And I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet. <SEP> And I finally was. So it was an interesting experience. I was kind of boring. Was it civil or criminal? It was municipal court. A grand jury or. <SEP> So it was a combination of. And I was in the pool for a couple of weeks. I see. <SEP> So it was a combination of criminal and civil. And they had. Most of the time we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors. And then it was always exciting when we got called to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides just sit in the jury room. Did the judge hand down sentences. Or did you folks do that? <SEP> The judge did. I had a hard time getting seated on a jury. I kept getting. I'd be questioned for empaneling the jury. And they kept dismissing me. <SEP> Course they don't have to give a reason. But it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like. They want to get the best mix for their case. So they ask all kinds of wild questions. That's a science in itself. <SEP> I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions. And I think part of it was they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more. I see. <SEP> Because you'd probably be too puritanical. And. That was probably it. <SEP> Although in my case I might have been more sympathetic with the person who got caught. I don't know. Were the sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair. Or would. If you were deciding do you think that they would have been different. <SEP> I was never there for any sentencing. I finally got empaneled on one case on my next to the last day. And we got into the jury room to decide the case. And there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was not guilty. And he would never vote for guilty. So they appointed me jury foreman. And I didn't think that going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict. So I told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate. <SEP> So the whole thing had to be tried over again. I bet that made him happy. It was funny. The. I don't know. I didn't like not being able to deliberate. <SEP> I wanted to vote guilty for the guy. And the other people were kind of mixed. So the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again. Cost him a lot of money. I'm sure. How many members were on the jury? Was it a six or twelve member jury? <SEP> It must have been six. That's kind of curious to me. I didn't realize until the Wayne Kennedy Smith trial a few months ago that they had six member juries. I thought that it was always twelve men tried and true so to speak. <SEP> But apparently for some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment. I know on a. Getting to this unanimous thing whether a jury should be unanimous or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous. It's a simple majority rules. <SEP> Let's see. Is it on capital crimes that they have to be unanimous. And. Probably on capital. I don't know. We. The two that I were on had to do with drugs. <SEP> And we were unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of various things. The government really failed to prove its case. And being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof. And we had to acquit him in both cases. It was too circumstantial? It was in some of the critical things like special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person. But something happened to the camera and the tape and. <SEP> All they could do was testify.
sw4072.txt:. How do you keep up with current events? Actually usually in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work. Usually catch the news in the morning. What channel do you watch or what station? <SEP> N B C. That's the one I watch. I usually keep up with T V. I don't. I am a student. So I really don't have much time to read the newspapers and stuff. So I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really isn't too great sometimes. <SEP> I usually tend to just rely on T V again just through the grapevine just to know what today's stories are. And I usually go out an buy a newspaper if I'm interested in any particular one. The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes. The stations I listen to are just mainly music. <SEP> I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all. Do you think that T V is pretty accurate. Sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized. Or. What I really don't like about T V especially local news as compared to national news is just it seems like everything is very spoon feed. And it's more like the news shows is now an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have the wonderful investigative reports is your kid's bus driver smoking crack on the way to school? <SEP> It's. They mainly go with popular topics just not basic news. <SEP>. Also I have the observation with the press that any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press which only happened ten times in my life first thing or anything that actually had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story. <SEP> It's something wrong. Going. Looks like they're going more for ratings than for actual news. <SEP> I think probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers. They typically have a better. I am from a small town too here in Texas and so local news is really who grew the biggest tomato. <SEP> And. The farm report. Farm report and oil reports. <SEP> That's pretty sad. Or who killed who. Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television. Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down. And. In Dallas I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's. And the story was. <SEP> Was that like he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something? And the news covered it hours after it happened. And they were taping people who were crying who had everything. <SEP> And then three days later this local news station was using as their promo to promote themselves. I just thought that's kind of cold. <SEP> I have seen that happen lots of times. Channel X gives you the best coverage. We were on the scene with our team players. And. And it was just. They were showing these dead people. And they were showing people crying. <SEP> Just taking advantage of. <SEP> They are trying to get the most emotional response for. It didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story. But just the play on people's emotions. It's just gotten so. Somewhere it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if. And everything. <SEP> I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally. Even the national news I just find it to be very watered down. <SEP> Very. What did you think of the coverage of the war? I found it very one sided. Did you? <SEP> It just seemed to lack any sort of debate. Not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there. But it just seemed like. They kept just showing how great we were doing. And it never really showed the damage that really happened that's. <SEP>. A lot of times the news coverage showed all the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties. <SEP> And they kind of. If they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who got really hurt and everything. <SEP> And I really think that in the involvement that the press states that the military basically sets the press.
sw4036.txt:I think that one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't convict someone who really shouldn't be convicted. Definitely. And I think that a unanimous verdict helps to ensure that. I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that you would have a problem that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. <SEP> Have you ever served on a jury before? I have twice. <SEP> It was a pretty wild experience. What sorts of cases were they? They were just small time cases where trailers and banks were involved. So were they criminal or civil? <SEP> They were civil. They weren't any criminal. What was the verdict? Did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? <SEP> The jury I think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people. So it was. They. And the one changed his vote at the end. So did it become? <SEP> So it became unanimous after they turned it in. And then he changed his mind after they turned it in. <SEP> But it then became unanimous. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter? You just needed a majority? What was the other case? That was also civil? <SEP> The other case was just traffic. The. And it was seat belt law. And it didn't even hardly go through. Didn't really even count. <SEP> So. I'm a college student. So I haven't been a jury eligible age for very long. And I did get one summons actually at one point. But I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student because it was a very bad time. <SEP> You learn a lot going to the juries like that though. I would like to do at some point. But I haven't. One thing that I think maybe is a problem is I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now. But I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well. Especially sort of. I wouldn't think that it does from what I experienced in them. Wha-. <SEP> It didn't turn out the way I planned it the way that I would think that it would go. You thought it turned out pretty well? But it was. Jury was unorganized. And it just wasn't organized enough for me. <SEP> I'm not used to it not being organized. And I just assumed that it would have been. So it was just kind of a zoo. And the jurors just sort of. Someone had to figure out what was going on? That's about what it was. That's interesting. Did it work out pretty well in the end? Did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume sort of a moderator role in the trial. Or. <SEP> They picked one person. And then he finally moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. So it did end up working out pretty well? It ended up working all right. The one thing I sometimes wonder about in civil cases is whether especially sort of in maybe product liability or medical malpractice where there's sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes. <SEP> It's not just a matter of did this guy rip off this guy. And it's just a matter of interpreting a contract. It's sort of a matter of sometimes getting into very technical issues. And I wonder if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about whatever issue is under discussion. I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on. In the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. So. <SEP> The bank was suing them because they went to get the trailer which was seemingly their property. <SEP> It was on his property. So the deal was that he had borrowed money from the bank to buy it. And he hadn't made the payments. <SEP> So they came to get it. And then when they came to get it it was on the landlord's property. And he wouldn't let them take it off. So they were suing to get it back. <SEP> And it was a double wide. So they'd already taken it apart. So they left it there. <SEP> And then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it. So they were suing him for the money. And there's no way they could because it was the moving company.
sw4150.txt:. How many kids do you have? <SEP> I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children. We have three children who are eleven nine and eight. So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about. But perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time. <SEP> And. Anyway. You don't have children? <SEP> But you're married? We've been married for two and a half years. We've been trying for about two years but no luck yet. Hopefully. <SEP> I know we're not supposed to do this long distance. But actually I'm getting a call. I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting. Could I ask you to hold one minute? I'll be right back. Excuse me just a moment. Had-. <SEP> They're going to get mad. She had another call. She has just three kids eleven nine and eight. <SEP> I'm so sorry. That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting. <SEP> That keeps you bu-. Do you have a lot of activities with your kids? <SEP> I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation. But. We do. Both my husband and I work. And our children are sixth fourth and third grade. And the school years are wonderful. They're just wonderful. <SEP> The kids they are real people. And they are interesting. And they have all their own activities. And I think as parents we really enjoy them in our personal situation. Our children have not yet decided to rebel. So they're pretty good kids? <SEP> I'm sure that's coming though. But they are wonderful kids. We had ni- wh- growing up. I guess I can talk about us. We had nine kids in our family. We had eight boys and one girl. But my Dad. <SEP> You had eight boys and one girl? And the time that we spent with our Dad was he owned his own business. So we worked with him most of the time. So that's how we spent most of the time with him. Are you Mormons? <SEP> That's the Utah and the large family. That was a dead giveaway? We're Catholics. I came from a family of five. I had four brothers. <SEP> The only girl. And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled. That. <SEP> I never felt spoiled. In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed. I was going to say my sister wasn't spoiled very much. <SEP> Usually busy fighting for survival. That's. But. I do think with working parents there are some real issues here. That I think. <SEP> I don't know. It's an interesting problem. I happen to. I'm a pediatrician. My husband is a physician. So I talk to parents about this a lot. But children. I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family. <SEP> And I feel when my children were very young I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing. And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home. <SEP> I really believe that. And it has helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age. And I think our kids are real secure. And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot. So I know it sounds like a rationalization. But I really think it's true for our family. Wel-. <SEP> And I think it has worked very well. It's like you said to each his own. And we're planning on having my wife stay home. But. There's no question. I think that's really the best. If a woman is happy doing that. <SEP> I hate to put it quite that way. I was twenty-nine when I had my first child. And I would not have been real fulfilled. I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child. <SEP> It's wonderful to be a mother. But I like the way I did it. I sort of worked half time. I had very flexible hours. I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year. And you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to mothers. <SEP> And I think we choose very very carefully the alternative situations that we had them in. <SEP> Some baby-sitting groups. Again I know it sounds like a rationalization. But I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children. And they learn to share. They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure. I think that helps. That's good. Sounds like you have a handle on it. <SEP> Your wife does she work right now? Not right now. <SEP> She's out. We just moved down here. We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years. You're still trying to dry out? That's no problem here. We really liked it up there. But then wh-.
sw4168.txt:What were you saying? I think we're started now. <SEP> Do you want to go ahead and start? I haven't really been up to date on a lot of music. I've been in school. And I haven't really gone out and bought any or listened to much on the radio except for classical. And. <SEP> You like classical music? I like classical music. I like rock and roll. <SEP> I like country and western. I like all kinds. I like different things about each one of them. I like most of them except for country music. <SEP> You don't like country? I think I might like dancing to it. But I don't like listening to it. The kind of country I like is kind of the older country music. Not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that. Whi-. <SEP> That's a little bit to. It's such. They're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing. You know what I mean? What's the old country music like? <SEP> Like Hank Williams. Like the old Hank Williams. Even Hank Williams Junior is real good stuff. The kind that. <SEP> This stuff makes you cry it sounds so sad. You d-. That's the kind you like you mean? <SEP> Sometimes I do. Not all the time. I guess I like the blues a lot. And I guess you could say it's similar as far as the way they do it. <SEP> And I do too. I also like jazz. Me too. I guess I like. Except heavy metal. And most rap I don't like. <SEP> You're about like I am then. I can't watch M T V anymore. I used to love M T V. <SEP> And I can barely watch anymore because they have this heavy metal stuff on there. And I can't like that. And I liked Aerosmith and Led Zepplin and. Van Halen. <SEP>. <SEP> I like groups like that. But when you get. I even like Guns and Roses some of their stuff. But some of these groups now like Slaughter. I really haven't listened to that. <SEP> Some of them are just really rough. You went to school then in. I'm surprised you didn't go to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff. Or. I used to a long time ago. But since I've started back into school now I haven't really done that much. I've been pretty busy. But. So. I haven't. I used to go out and dance a lot. But I don't do that anymore either. <SEP> I see. Are you married at all? I've just been real busy with lots of other things. <SEP> How old are you? Twenty-eight. You went to school for awhile and quit. Then went back. I went to school and got a degree. And then I worked for awhile. And then I started back a year and a half ago. Changed directions. <SEP>. How old are you? I'm twenty-eight. I was born in sixty-three. I guess we're the same age then. <SEP> And I didn't really start getting into music until I went to college because my parents didn't really have music in the house. Put it that way. Were they religious? <SEP> I see. I. I'm always behind. I'm never really up to date on all that stuff. But I know what I like when I like a sound. A certain kind of sound. My parents were very musical. My mother had a piano in the house. <SEP> My father likes country western music. <SEP> He's from West Virginia. So that's what he grew up listening to. And he's always liked it. And he's probably about fifty-three years old now. So he grew up in the late fifties. When they had the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that. And that kind of rock and roll. <SEP> So he likes that. And my mom always liked that kind of stuff. My mom likes Doris Day. <SEP> She always had these old Doris Day records and stuff like that though. I grew up listening to that stuff. <SEP> But I could see why you were kind of sheltered from music. I do play the piano. <SEP> But I like the early seventies late sixties rock. Kind of stuff the old stuff. And. <SEP> So do I. Do you like Van Halen or anything like that? Or how about Brian Adams? Bri-. What songs does he play? <SEP> It. THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. <SEP> I think I've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. He sings that. <SEP> He's from Canada. I'm not very good at remembering the titles. The titles and artists. But I can remember the song. <SEP> Do you watch music television M T V at all? Or V H One? I don't watch T V much at all. <SEP>. Do you get cable? <SEP> That's. You have to get cable to get those stations anyhow. <SEP> But. I like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos. I like watching that kind of thing. It's. Do you like someone recent? Like Enya? Have you ever head of her. She's not rock. But she's from Ireland. <SEP> I haven't heard her. And she's been on the top ten or whatever. <SEP> She did.
sw4137.txt:Let's see. Mine's pretty easy actually. I just got done reading a couple magazine articles about the new Saturns. And although I can't afford it right now I would just love to have one. <SEP> You like. So you're an American. You want to buy American. Regardless of that fact. It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. I'm interested in having it for doing a little autocross racing closed circuit racing. <SEP> And it seems to just blow the competition away. It terms of handling acceleration. Handling power everything. It just got the top rating. It was compared up against. Let's see. There was the Mazda M X three Nissan's whatever their N X two thousand the Civic S I. And it dominated over all of them. Everybody all the raters loved it. I like the styling. And I seen a few of them actually race. And they seem to be really good cars for it. <SEP> What about Mustang G T -s? Mustang G T -s? Can't afford it. Those. So you're talking about ones in a lower end price range. I'm a graduate student. And let's face it. I don't make any money. So. <SEP> You can wait till you graduate. And you'll have plenty of money. You can buy whatever you want. <SEP> We'll see then. Right now I'm stuck. I've got a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that. It's fast but unreliable. And trying to get it prepared for racing. But it would be nice just scrap it and go for the Saturn. Would you use that for city driving and racing? I'd use it for both. The nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both. <SEP> Autocrossing is. What kind of track is that? Just a set up a lot of times. And it's really large parking lots. And pylons and things. And you set up the track pylons. <SEP> Tight turns hard acceleration. I've seen a lot of Mustangs compete. And it's interesting. They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class. <SEP>. I would guess so. What are you thinking about buying? <SEP> I think I'd like to get B M W or maybe a Acura Legend. The Legend. <SEP> A Lexus S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order. I haven't really determined if I like the Japanese or if I like them enough to purchase one. Because your B M W -s your German cars have good reputations I think. <SEP> I was actually in. A lot of the B M W -s are produced in Stutgardt and Munich. <SEP> And I was there this summer. And I was really impressed by the factory tours and such for B M W. The. <SEP> They have the whole philosophy. They kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better which is kind of hard to take. <SEP> As you're walking through that little tour in Munich it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you too. Of course. Of course they are. They want you to buy their car. There. It was interesting. I also went to the Porsche. And it was amazing how they were completely opposed. <SEP> The B M W is really we have all these high tech things. And everything is put together with exacting tolerances. And then you go to Porsche. And it's these cars are completely handmade. And no two of them are alike. <SEP> And. That's. So it's completely opposed. I don't know. Which do I like better. I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical. <SEP> It's not realistic. Unless it's a toy. If you can afford that kind of a toy then I guess. Let's face it. <SEP> But B M W -s good for that. What kind of driving you'd want to use it for? Just work. Short trips. No heavy mileage. I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year. <SEP> So it's pretty minimal. That's cool. Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for. That's good. I was impressed by the Mercedes too. <SEP> I really like the Mercedes. But if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things. The factory was nice. And. <SEP> And is it different for the B M W? I think something on the order of a three series it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly. Probably. <SEP> I can imagine that. So I'm kind. <SEP> I'm not sure if I really want.
sw4026.txt:. How's your products been? I really haven't had too many problems. Seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out. I hear that one. Have you had any lately go out? <SEP> I've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three. And they. Unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time when I bought my new house. And I really don't have any recourse. So I had to call and have them all repaired and that. It was a hassle. So you didn't get anything. Even all the warranties were out? <SEP> The warranty on the refrigerator. The i-. The refrigerator warranty's still good. But the ice maker itself passed its three years. And it was three years and two months. You're kidding. We just moved into a new house too. So we had to buy all those too. <SEP> Watch out. The only thing I've had problems with is. I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail. And I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such. And when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings. So. <SEP> I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than. I just ended up using it. But that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong. But. I usually have pretty good luck with appliances. But I just. It was within two days that all three of these stopped working. And the ice maker had to have a new pump. That's incredible. <SEP> And the microwave had to have some kind of something I can't even pronounce. And they. The dryer had to have a new heating element. So it was almost three hundred dollars for all three of them. And they all went out at the same time? <SEP> Within two days of each other. Or two days. I was. It wasn't a good week. I was pretty mad. <SEP> And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business. So I think even if I had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that manufactured. But still they were through that retailer. So I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not. It's frustrating. But I didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty. <SEP> So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all. But I. The only other things that I've ever had trouble with. I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers. They go out a lot? <SEP> I've had two or three of those go out. One was under warranty. And the other two weren't. But I just. Other than that T V -s and things like that I haven't ever had any trouble with. I don't think products are getting much better though. I'm in the manufacturing. Home from work. And make automotive air bags the safety air bags. <SEP> That's interesting. At Morton International. And I thin-. It's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment. We test everything after each assembly process. And so our testing is pretty thorough. But. Do you test each individual one. <SEP> Or do you just test. If you've got ten you test one. And by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay? The tests that. We test every one electrically. We don't. I think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags. But we do test during the assembly product after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it. So each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done. And then we do electrical tests on them during the process. So. <SEP> That's something I've never had to use. I've never been involved in an automobile accident. So luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test. But I think it's a great idea. I'm. Seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about. But that. They do all the testing that we have to do through the government. It's incredible how much testing they have to do. <SEP> I'm sure they want to be thorough before they. But even. I don't mind spending the extra money on the car even if they pass the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing. I'm not a real big seat belt. My.
sw4008.txt:Do you have a P C? I have a Macintosh S E thirty. A lot of my friends are into Macintoshes. I have a I B M P C myself. <SEP> A two eighty-six. I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six. What do you use yours for mostly? Mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal. <SEP> But I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that. What do you find that you use yours mostly for? I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base. And about the only thing. I'm just starting to get into a little bit more communications now. I've just today ordered a fax modem. So I'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using. <SEP> You don't have to make a hard copy that way. Are you using windows? I think I'm planning on moving up getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although I do like the graphical user environment. <SEP>. It's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh. It's. I just want it more for multi tasking which I suppose is also like a Macintosh. <SEP>. The one thing I used to use a. I've never used an I B M actually. I used to use just an Apple two E which of course looks pretty primitive now. <SEP> That's what I learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school. But I don't have any real programming capabilities on my Mac right now. <SEP> I don't have any compilers. So I'm. Do you use your computer for just things around the house or in the. <SEP> I use it in my business. What do you do? I do consultation and testing of various kinds for English as a second language programs. And do these programs. Are they based on a other language. Or are they based. A lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of parts of the world. And the teacher just tries to teach English through natural understanding. <SEP> That's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly. You seem to be better informed than the average person on that. It was just when I was high school I worked for the community school. And they had a English second language class. And it always seemed strange to me that all these people that spoke English not too well and spoke a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time. <SEP> I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you don't have as many cues. You don't have hand gestures and things like that. We. What I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though. <SEP> Most of the stuff that I do is not interactive. And I use it for data analysis on testing. So. To see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that. <SEP> Actually just item analysis statistical analysis of the tests. When you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is. <SEP> You try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort. So it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use. I would imagine so. So what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E? <SEP> I was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files. I can't believe I've got five megabytes on this one now. It's. <SEP> And on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K. It's amazing how in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much. I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it. And then I started playing with Apples. And those had forty-eight. Or if they were really great they had sixty-four K. <SEP> The original Apple had forty-eight I guess didn't it. I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them is all. <SEP> And. I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K. And there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time. <SEP> And it's just so amazing that generally if you. I'm not sure about Macintoshes. But I know I B M -s you buy a megabyte at a time. That's the low end. <SEP> The S P thirty goes up to eight. But I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet. I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and get possibly another hard disk. I don't know. They say that system seven uses a lot of memory. I imagine.
sw4148.txt:. With the issue of trial by jury I actually found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting. Actually I agree that that's an interesting thing. I believe for civil suits it's not unanimous. But for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law? <SEP> I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where it was okay for a state to have it eleven out of twelve. I actually thought I'd read that too. And that's why I phrased it that way. I wonder. The difference could be that for state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote. And things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require. But I don't know what the laws. Do you think that that's an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous? <SEP> I'd be curious as to what the requirement for an acquittal is. And I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal. But I don't know whether you need a unanimous vote of not guilty to acquit. That would be an interesting change. It was also allow the idea that if you had one person who was very disagreeable that it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt criterion that it increases the likelihood of getting the proper judgment. So I think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision. I'd agree with that. But I've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury although I've been out here and registered for about five years. Actually I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do. <SEP> But. I would like to do that. I've been out here twenty some years. And I've been called three different times. But I've never actually even made it into the jury box. Because there have always been a number of people. And I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions. I. I also think that would be really good. I. <SEP> The people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is something like a nine three or more severe and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right. And in fact I'm not sure that that's any more liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else. The one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on. <SEP> And that peer pressure. And in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons. I'd read one book that went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors based on the deliberations. <SEP> Some of them did say that when they were the only one left opposing the verdict everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict. I understand. You would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response. I think of the movie TWELVE ANGRY MEN. <SEP> You ever seen that movie? Once. It's exactly that situation where. It's Henry Fonda. And it's eleven to one. And he's the one. I believe he was opposed to the conviction. And he held on. And.
sw4101.txt:. They just started a recycling program here I think. Actually this is my first experience with recycling program. But instead of just tossing everything away which I always felt bad about I am starting to split stuff up. The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb. They make me drive it a mile down the road and spit it out down there. What are they doing up there? Here in Saskatoon much the same thing. There is no curb pick up of any of the recycled products. We're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people. There are areas where we could. Actually we have a couple of the handicapped societies types of places where the one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers. So we are able to have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing. And then there's a deposit program on plastic and glass containers. Primarily soft drink bottles. And so we are able to take it to one of the rehabilitation centers. And then they recycle the containers. They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container. And then. <SEP> The deposit's only on drink stuff. Primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing. <SEP> So they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers. We do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well. And so the recycler with the handicapped group will also accept those. So it's fairly extensive. But then again it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city. <SEP> Did they. Are you giving these products to the handicapped group. And the handicapped group is getting the money. Or are they some home distributing the funds back to you. Actually there's the opportunity for both. Generally the handicapped group takes care of the things that. Actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back. And then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit. And then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as well. <SEP> That's very cool. I heard about a similar program in New York City where a thing called Homeless Incorporated or something like that. But what they do is employ homeless people to go out and collect all the recyclable cans. And I think it's mostly cans. There may be bottles as well but beer cans soda cans and what not. And they bring them up to one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people that desperately need it. I guess partly because of our climate. Here in Saskatoon at least the majority of central. I want to say Central Canada. But Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec. But we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people. We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing. There's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes. <SEP> Do they do it with news papers as well? They have done it some. But we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers. They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers. The shopping malls. There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects. Or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins. And then the bins are collected. Some of the.
sw4166.txt:. Before a couple of years ago I had a very narrow view of nursing homes. And it was more like a funeral home. I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home. And then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas. And I went to one. And it just had a very good activities director. Everyone was cheerful. And now I don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore. But I certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort. I have a sister that is in nursing school. And she's real interested in geriatrics. That sounds good. <SEP> She's real interested in what Ann Richards has been doing. Ann Richards is really cracking down on the nursing homes. And you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor. I've heard the name. And that's about all it goes. Ann Richards is our governor in Texas. And she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes. And my sister's real interested in that and getting into that side of nursing. That's one problem with the nursing home environment. The elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse. <SEP> They don't always have their full wits about them. They're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on. <SEP> And it can be pretty sad. I've had a grandmother who had a stroke. And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died. And it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida. My families was up in Maryland. <SEP> And the other part of her family was up in New York state. And it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she could not do very much for herself after the stroke. <SEP> And the nursing home was the best facility to put her in. Besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work. And both my aunts and uncle work. Which means it's very difficult for some-. <SEP> You essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time. And there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home. Which makes it. <SEP> It's a necessary evil I think. It sure is. And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive. Cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older. <SEP> And even there you have to watch out for. You get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there. And the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes. <SEP> My grandfather passed away several years ago. I was much younger. But he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life. And someone visited him every day. My grandmother did. But if she couldn't someone visited him every day. It was in a very small town nursing home. And people didn't get paid much there at all. They didn't care about what went on. <SEP> They would let a patient get a lot of bed sores. And the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people. And then the nurses and doctors really didn't put forth any loving care for them. Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the care that they need. Cause it's. <SEP>. An elderly person can. It's like a newborn baby. You need to have twenty-four hour care answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points. <SEP>. <SEP> And nurses get so worn down. And there's a number of. The elderly are very complaining because they remember the way that things used to be. And remember being able to do things for themselves which they no longer can. <SEP> And they feel pretty helpless. And it very very hard for them to accept that. We just moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but a transitional type facility. <SEP> Is it like a retirement center? More of a retirement home. He's got his own efficiency apartment. And they provide one meal a day. <SEP> And the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him. But they do have group activities going on. <SEP> How's he handling that? He'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida. To move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland. And it's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else. <SEP>. There wasn't anything like that that you could do in Florida? There was stuff like that in Florida. But.
sw4109.txt:Guy. Some of my things. I'd like to have a short work week. And we need better health insurance and cau-. <SEP> We can start off there. Let's just get started. If you don't want to talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it. <SEP> I just press one then? <SEP>. I think that a short work week is real nice. I have a thirty-seven hour work week. How about you? Right now I'm just a student. I only work part time. But I've work in the job force before. <SEP> And forty hours is just too long. You just don't have any time to do anything. It seems like Saturday you get off. But Sunday you're getting ready for Monday. And if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job. <SEP> And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday. And that would make a bigger market. We'd have more recreation. People would have time to do it. There would be less of a stress level. We'd have less crime. We'd have to build less prisons less police force. It all makes sense to me. Although there may be more crime. If people have more leisure time. It's not clear. And that. That's a possibility. <SEP> One of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the small business can't offer health insurance. And it's too costly. And what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it. So they get a specific rate. What happens is that if people start having chronic illness and things like that. What happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular. <SEP> It's called a group. What happens then is that they cancel because they just can't cancel an individual. So they have to cancel just life insurance. They have to cancel everything. What they do is that they cancel the insurance. And then all the people don't have any insurance coverage. <SEP> But I'm satisfied with my job. I'm an engineering student. And I work for my instructor. And I'm not a typical student. I'm older. I'm in my thirties. <SEP> And so I have a lot of job experience. And my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants. And he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose. But in the same token it's really enjoyable for me because I don't have to have nobody breathing down my back. And one of the things that I really hate about jobs. I don't like bosses that want to yell at you and are down on your back and all this and that. <SEP> I just really can't deal with that. What kind of jobs have you done? <SEP> I do research in computer science. And I've just been doing that for a few years now. My job has most of the benefits I want. What I really like is I like being. They send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as I'd like. But that's just nice a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of. They also. A really important thing to me is when they pay for continuing education. I get night courses that they'll cover right now. And that's really good. That's just great. You have what you might call knowledge power. <SEP> When you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized. Some people can be let go and replaced like a typist somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist. But if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the knowledge you've revised and revamped the system then you're vital to the company. And you get more benefits. That's where I'm. I'm into computers too. And that's one of the things that I've found in any one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge. When you have the knowledge you're not going to be let go. Be one of the last ones to let go anyway. <SEP> What I.
sw4064.txt:How do you feel about trial by jury? I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently. In what way? <SEP> In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence that's presented. I have very little regard for the law presently practiced. Do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits? <SEP> I was thinking primarily criminal cases. Do you think that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry. <SEP> That's a concern of mine. I would feel more comfortable in many cases with judges. Doing the sentencing. The only thing that really bothers me about that is I think that a judge can be. I like the idea of juries of your peers in that you get personally more than one person making a decision. And second of all you get a wide variety of background. So that. <SEP> My question are they really your peers? I'd agree with that. Too often I think they are not. That's definitely a problem. <SEP> And when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have that is a matter of concern to me too. <SEP> I think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased. Now I happen to know several judges. And there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury. I would feel a little bit uneasy about. <SEP> But the other two would give either the plaintiff or for the defendant the full benefit of the law. <SEP> And I guess that's what I am concerned with. I guess I definitely agree with you. But the. What I don't like about the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less. The same crime gets unequal sentences. <SEP> This is very true. I think there is more of an ability for selecting two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea versus whether he is guilty or innocent. <SEP> But I think there would be a large variation in trying to gage the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that measure stick across the board. And you do see such uneven sentencing evidence of it in the newspapers and such where it would appear the crimes were very similar. <SEP> But one individual got twenty-five years. And the other one was sentenced to life. So. <SEP> Of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to get a good lawyer. Isn't that the truth? <SEP> There are times when is it. My mind has gone blank it's Othello. You know where he says kill all the lawyers. Every now and then one is tempted to see what. I agree. <SEP> But it's taken me a long time to understand that lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as novices tend to think that attorneys care about justice. <SEP> I agree with it. They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty. It's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument. <SEP> And they are very effective too. That the. <SEP> Even. I have been involved just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty. But his attorneys gotten him off. <SEP> The city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge. So I don't know. This is a little bit of the subject. But one thing that I really dislike also that's new is that I have heard that there are federal sentences.
