sw4682.txt:Have you had that experience recently? Recently I can't really say recently. But I think about a year ago I bought a product from some company down in Atlanta Georgia. I believe it was one of these mixers. These juice machines. And the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked perfectly okay. <SEP> But I found that it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting after. Even despite diligent washing it got rusty after about three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because I had made a point of drying it off and cleaning it. But it was. I had to send it back after the third week because I realized it was not. Something was very very wrong with the blade. What about you? I don't have so much trouble with products as service. <SEP> I don't feel like that's as big a problem. I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly. And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent. <SEP> The one I have now is okay most of the time. But that's it. But that's probably the worst. My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. James Avery. I don't know if you have that up there. But it's a very good company. That sells sterling silver things. <SEP> And she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now. <SEP> And the catch broke. And she was sitting in school on a carpet. And when she stood up it caught and broke. And we took it back. And they said this was just obviously yanked. This was yanked. They were so rude about it. <SEP> And so we wanted a different kind of catch. And she said it's not guaranteed. And I said put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed. So do it anyway. So we got the kind we wanted. And I was really disappointed with that. I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable. <SEP> And I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends. And I called there to see if they had it. And the lady was very nice. And I said my goodness. I said you've been very nice what's your name. And she told me. And I said I really appreciate it. I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store. And it turned out she was the assistant manager. So. <SEP> At least you're talking to somebody who counts. So I felt kind of good about that. I didn't even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything. <SEP> But I just felt like at least I did something. Maybe they'll fix it. They might work on that. But I find attitudes are more of a problem. Service is more of a problem. <SEP> I find. Up here in the northeast we have these mail order companies like L L Bean. And they are famous for having really top-notch service. They've got. I have friends and family who order from them because you can literally I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half. And even after eighteen months of reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition. And they will gladly take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore. They'll actually do things like this. They bend over backwards service wise for you. I've found also a lot of companies nowadays they have eight hundred numbers you can call. That's really great. <SEP> I guess you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies. And actually I've tried that with a few companies lately. And most of them have been pretty good. But I was. One reason why I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that if you buy through Bean or though. I guess one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in Wisconsin somewhere. They're very good about insur-. The customer is always right. And no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding. And they make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise. That's really good. It use to be like that. <SEP> But. I don't think most places are like that anymore. <SEP> Nowadays with the economy the way it is I guess. There was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are. Things are getting rough out there. There's a lot of. The morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn.
sw4611.txt:. I should say something. <SEP> That I'm the least informed. This is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic. But I'm the least informed person in the whole United States. This has not been determined yet. But I've never read a newspaper in my entire life. And I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off. But. <SEP> Any particular reason? I've explored that with lots of people. They've tried to lock me up and things like that. But I'm basically not interested. And I also find everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and off the. What am I trying to say. I do learn about things. Largely from friends. <SEP>. And I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS. Someone will write a book about something. And then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier. But it. And somehow. And anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it. But I don't think it's just that I'm lazy. <SEP> I really don't. I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon. Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest. But assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas. Without thinking that there were people who think each other area of specialty. <SEP> And I guess you could explain it two ways. And the cynical view is these things aren't doing a very good job at all. And the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or particularly interested in buying something as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things. <SEP>. <SEP> And I think the same thing is true with news. If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and especially the better papers the TIMES the WALL STREET JOURNAL the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea. <SEP> If you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much. Doesn't want. Let me ask by the way just for the record. I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them. I'm not being elitist in that sense I hope. <SEP> There's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things. What. And most people think it is. And I can accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it. By the way when you say most people think it is. I think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is percent. <SEP> I don't think it's that high. You don't? I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper. <SEP> And I think they're saying if something's really important I'll at least find out that it happened. And that's is a reasonable start. And for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked. And if something important happened it was covered on T V. And I could then go and pick up newspapers if it were important enough to read about. <SEP> And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels. I did on the Supreme Court hearings for the whole business of. I actually have a. Clarence Thomas or. The Thomas and Anita Hill business. <SEP> That's the closest thing. I deeply cared about that. And I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine. And when I arrived at her house she was engrossed in that. We ended up watching it for a couple of hours. Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more. And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on. But even then I didn't end up doing it on my own. <SEP> I stayed as far away from those as I could. I decided I didn't want to waste the time. I had five years ago now wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings. And afterwards decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in. And that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out. <SEP>. <SEP> Do you ever read.
sw4765.txt:A lot of companies now are using drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users. And I know the government gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government. <SEP> And I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it. I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian. And I feel that if you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background. Of course we're. Being involved in my organization we have deep background checks. But sometimes drug use can escape that. <SEP> And I have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to figure out who has a drug problem and putting that guy into therapy whatever it is to break this activity. <SEP> Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs. And there isn't anything. But getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope. What's your feeling? <SEP> I guess I'm probably a little more toward the other direction. I guess mainly because I. There's two sides to it I guess. One is that if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever even if it's smoking inhibits your ability to function then I think that I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual on the spot. But I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business. And I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go. We had prohibition for awhile. And then we didn't have prohibition. We've had laws against various other forms of drugs for the last sixty or seventy years. <SEP> Maybe a little longer. I think the first morphine laws were nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that. Eighty years or so. <SEP> So I. It's hard for me to justify what seems like basically a breach of the freedom from search and seizure on something that may or may not stand as a law fifty years from now or even twenty or ten. Who knows. The thing of it is that is in many respects just an over simplification. Prohibition certainly didn't last. I think there's so much criminal activity that people go into to support drug habits. <SEP> But you got to look at prohibition though. You had the same problems there? They support drug habits with things like burglary or prostitution or stuff like that. It goes back to that again. If you look at prohibition. Because it's illegal it costs more. If it was legal. Face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for ten or twenty dollars an ounce. I must admit that. <SEP> And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap. And you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it. But. Get. I must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society. <SEP> That's why there's people dealing it because there's money in it. There's ridiculous amounts of money. But I think that being in law enforcement I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it. But I really feel as though the interdiction effort is. As soon as you get rid of one goon that's involved in drugs and tha-. <SEP> Interdiction's hopeless. And then another one will jump up. There's no way you're ever going to win that. But we see. <SEP> The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is. That's a losing fight. As soon as we wind up for. If we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand. But people want to get stoned. And I don't see that. <SEP> It goes back to what can society impose on people. Can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen? I don't think you can. I was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic. So I'm one of these ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people. <SEP> So. I can really relate to. Everybody ought to do their own share. I don't have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff. But.
sw4608.txt:How do you feel about the crime in your city? Is it. Minneapolis isn't too bad. I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders. <SEP> That's kind of gone up in scale and some other things. I personally had a little experience the other day. Somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck. But actually when you look at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it's really quite a bit better. Because I came from Florida. <SEP> And in Orlando crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever. So. What part of California are you from? San Jose California. <SEP> I have a good friend there. Here the real problems are the gangs. A lot of murders just in general the whole. We've only been here a couple of years. Before that we lived in Colorado. But in comparison to Colorado it's real noticeable. <SEP>. I can just sense. I won't go to the grocery store at night. That's. You know. And it's that kind of thing. And. <SEP> That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like. We have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce home theft burglary and things of that sort. Do you have that where you live. Or. <SEP> Interestingly enough right before I moved up here. I'm an intern. And then I go back down in May. But in Orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it. We've been broken into in my apartment about four times in two and a half weeks. <SEP> And one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there. Because they were just. It's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work. <SEP> And then the houses were left unguarded. But. I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it. That's a good way to work it with a neighborhood watch. Also I've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home. Like on the weekends. <SEP> Is that right? A high percentage of free time. I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is spent doing yard work outdoors. So they wait while you're outdoors. They know the house is unlocked. And then they just slip in. Slip in slip out. <SEP> That's amazing. They know exactly what they're going for. So I've heard that's really on the rise as far as a new type of crime. <SEP> It almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter. <SEP> Unfortunately. Unfortunately it's starting to really look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day. <SEP> One of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit. <SEP> And the crime level there of course is quite a bit more pronounced. But. I guess. <SEP> I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis. I'm not real sure. It helps to know your neighbors. They give you. You're supposed to make lists of cars. I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar we have a list. Is that what you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates? Pretty much. <SEP> I was basically involved in that in the organization of it. And then I left right in the middle of it. I'm not sure where we went from there. <SEP> But. That whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious activities like that. <SEP> You hate to be paranoid. But there are really only so many things you can do. You can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program as a woman not go out at night. <SEP> You can do that which is what I choose to do. One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited. <SEP> Even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps. It's against the law to do a lot of things. They could basically. When I was getting robbed down in Florida I was really considering electrifying doors things like that like. That's. <SEP> They did in Miami that time. But it's not. If you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home it's considered self-defense though. <SEP> That's not always true. It isn't? There was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed. <SEP> And essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home. <SEP> The guy came in while he was home. And sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned. He didn't die. But he was severely burned. And he took the guy to court and won a settlement. So that makes you think. <SEP> It's like your hands are very much tied. I think if you had a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's down-.
sw4646.txt:Do you know anyone that is in a nursing home or has ever been in one? But my grandparents were looking into it before. So I know what they've said. <SEP> I'm trying to think. My wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's. And they were going to put her into a nursing home. And when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble. And the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a nuisance. Or worse than a nuisance. She sort of went bananas. They thought it was too much of a bother. And they couldn't deal with her. So I guess you need to know whether it's a no deposit no return kind of thing whether. <SEP> If they're equipped to handle the kind of patients you're going to have put in there too. Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still. <SEP> They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her. But they wanted to be independent as well. Have their own room. My grandmother actually was in a nursing home that. There was a retirement hotel and then a. There was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it. So for the first few years she had her own apartment and made her own meals sometimes. But could also go and eat someplace else. <SEP> And then as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care. And she didn't have to do anything anymore. But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly. And that's som-. I don't know whether that's because they sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is. But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only six months or something. A lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help. <SEP> They need health care. So they're already ill before they go. That's probably a large factor. If you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are. Then you only go there as a last resort. <SEP> Or people send you there as a last resort. That's what my grandparents. It was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them. <SEP> So that was their thinking. Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency. And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make. So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time. <SEP> I guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all. I guess. That. You can't always get in when you want too. And of course you can't just sit around and wait. When you need it you need it I guess. <SEP> And the money is also another issue. How you're going to pay for it. <SEP> At that stage of life you only have so much money left. And I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings. It is kind of fair. But it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise. <SEP> So it's another problem. And if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price. So it's just so complicated anymore I think. People outlive their savings. And with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down. And they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore. Maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing. <SEP> It's just a shame that's the way it has to be. I think the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay. And cause if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. To have friends. <SEP> I've known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities. I don't know if they have them back there. But here in California and in Ari-.
sw4356.txt:. Have you heard about Saturns? I've heard some about Saturns. I don't know a lot about them. I haven't been over to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their reliability is rated to be equal to that of the Japanese cars. That's great. Actually that's kind of the type of car that I'm thinking about we might get. Saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a Saturn dealer. This offshoot of G M. <SEP>. And supposedly they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard. <SEP> I've heard a lot of people like them. Yet I don't know whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point. I'm kind of. My card and desires tend to be pretty picky. And so. Like what? Let's see. I like cars that are designed with human beings in mind. <SEP> And that's not just the driver and the passenger. But that's the person who's working on it. Cause I do almost all my own maintenance and those types of things. And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in finding a car anymore that's fairly easy for me to work on it's not very. Almost unlikely at this point. <SEP> And yo-. I've got a sixty-five Mustang. And I do most of the work on that myself. <SEP> And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that I just say I will never do that with the modern cars. It's not worth my time. You can't get in there. You can't do anything. And it's so complicated too. I look at it. And I say boy. I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that. <SEP> I've got an eighty-three Saab. And I find that for everyday things. It's really very easy to work on. And I'm kind of spoiled. I used to have a Chevy. <SEP> With a three fifty in it. And I really liked working on it. Cause it was pretty easy too. It was about a nineteen seventy. So I'm kind of biased in that. And I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore. <SEP> And that's probably one thing I'd look at. I think another thing I'd look at is safety. That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about. Actually one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags. <SEP> That's a real nice car I think. I've driven some Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. As rental cars. <SEP> And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus. It's a really nice car. I think it's a stylish car both inside and out. It's comfortable to drive. Reasonable performance. And this is out in California where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore. I've been real impressed with that. Yo-. And I didn't realize that they were putting dual air bags in that car now. Ninety. Or the ninety-twos. The ninety-twos had dual air bags. <SEP> This newest model. You could get them with duals. I think that That's excellent. <SEP> That's excellent because. But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars. Actually my wife and I are actually contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so. So we're actually been looking around and thinking about things. We'd like to get a. I don't know. What do you call it? A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that. <SEP> Year old ninety-two or something like that. Those are. If we. <SEP> That would be a good deal to go with. And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too. Because they looked really nice. <SEP> What do you looking for in those? What attracts you to the Saturns? Or of course we've already talked. The Taurus is safe. But what kind of things are you looking for? The Saturns you can get air bags in them. I don't think you can get dual side air bags. But one of the two things that I'm really. I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems. <SEP> You set down. You look at consumer reports. We've been pouring over consumer reports. And you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that. Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have. And the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars. <SEP> And the other one are the Saturns. So those two things. And then we kind of want a four door. <SEP>
sw4380.txt:Recently graduated from high school. Meaning three or four years ago. I'm a senior in college now. And I can't really talk too much about the problems with public education in detail because the school system I went to was really superb even though it was a public school system. <SEP>. I feel that my. I'm a junior in college now. And I go to Tech Georgia Tech? <SEP> And I. I got a friend who goes there by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward. <SEP> I've. The high school I went to was a good one also. And I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. Because the one I went to was a lot nicer than a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta. It's more or less a suburban school system? <SEP>. That was true for mine too. Although I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity. But I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. I know that in my town most of the parents they're valued education. <SEP> What d-. And so the students were to some extent motivated to learn. That's true. <SEP> And I'm also. In those places where the economy is really bad they might be more tempted to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would in areas where they. That's true. But I think even more than that even if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read. Which it sounds like. <SEP>. That's true. I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because they have these sort of mandatory tests you have to take before you get a diploma. <SEP> But certainly before that there were people that would graduate from high school and could barely read. And that's just sort of inexcusable. And you can't really. I just can't even picture how that could happen. Except maybe to someone who's really badly learning disabled or something. <SEP> But these people obviously weren't. That's hard for me to say since I didn't really grow. <SEP> When I went to elementary school it wasn't in a great area. But I started learning to read when I was in kindergarten. So I guess I can't say what it would be like to grow up in a really oppressed region. <SEP> I guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people. And I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably. <SEP> I think people just. So I guess the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn. And. And again I don't. They got to know how qualified. I think it'd be interesting to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Sort of maybe from elementary through high school. Just sort of to get a feel for what it's like. <SEP>. <SEP> I think that'd be an interesting experience. But I haven't done that. I can't say that I have either. <SEP> But. But I do think that public education in general can work. And I think it's a good thing. I've heard statistics and things that compare a public education to a private education. Within the same income groups. <SEP> If you compare the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that did send their kids to private schools. I think they compare fairly well. I honestly don't really think I could have done much better than I did in the school system I was in. <SEP> My schools there. I have a lot of. Once I got into high school they had a lot of accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that. <SEP> That makes a big difference. Cause I wondered when they're taking classes with people that are interested in the subject and stuff like that. And in the. Once you start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels. I guess in junior high it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of instruction in the major subjects. Which. <SEP> Actually I think that works pretty well. And that makes.
sw4792.txt:I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale California. This is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota. How you doing? Pretty good. <SEP> I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it. I'm ready whenever you are. <SEP> What are your thoughts on the subject there? I definitely think decisions have to be unanimous. I think that's probably a good thing. It's probably the safest thing. <SEP> It's to easy to get a quorum. And simple majority won't do. And even two-thirds majority it's. <SEP> That's. Quorums are to easy to get. And there's always that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason. <SEP> So it's. Definitely. But I don't know. I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing. Gives them a little too much power. <SEP> Tha-. I know of a couple of people who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently. But. Plus you may be doing a guilty verdict. But it may be for technical reasons. About the only good thing I would say about that is that it would hurry the process up a bit. <SEP> But even now I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that. And that's what the trial by jury. I know. If the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances who's to say. <SEP> It. There would be much more of that. No doubt. Are you involved in the legal system at all? But. I tend to follow it just to know what's going on. <SEP>. I've got some friends that are lawyers. So. I do too. So. <SEP> One of them just got his law degree. But to tell you the truth I'm not real familiar with the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now. I really haven't studied it in depth. I know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases. Which is. <SEP> It's more in how you present it versus who's right. I'm sure of it. Because a lot of those things it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better. <SEP> It's kind of weird. I don't know. I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get. <SEP> I know. It's just. When I was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and. <SEP> You say we can't bring up this point because then they're going to. The opposition will say this this and this and. And it's the stuff that they can twist around is. <SEP> It's pretty amazing. And it's like the truth isn't really important anymore. It's. It's not. And then you get people who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because. <SEP> This friend of mine's pretty obnoxious. And he really gets into suing people. And so he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case. <SEP> It's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. That sounds like a little abuse of our system. But. But. But it's for the more general. People don't want to take responsibility. <SEP> It's. And most of the time they're looking to place blame. And stuff. <SEP> You're from California. Is that right? Originally from Chicago. But. I was just thinking. I wonder how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and where I am in Minneapolis. I really. <SEP> From what I understand it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana. And Louisiana is completely different cause. It's based on common law. And the rest of the country is not or something like that. <SEP> Pretty strange. But fortunately I never have had to go in even for jury duty. I haven't either other than. <SEP> But that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in as a witness. He may subpoena me. So we'll see what happens. But. I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. <SEP> It's. There are too many big problems. There's such a backlog of court cases right now. To try to get them all in in a good time. I know. And we already have too many lawyers as it is. And if it's criminal cases you can't put them in jail because there's no room left. <SEP> That's true. And in fact they're even letting some go. I'm originally from Florida. And it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them. <SEP> That's not a good solution either. Not at all. I'm not real sure what the.
sw4349.txt:The last auto repair I had was. I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck. I had a tune up done. And I had the brakes done on it. And then the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope. And it has eight spark plugs. And it's hard to get at them. And plus the time on them. I just don't have time any more. As far as maintenance tasks that I do myself I usually change the oil and wash the air filter. And I had an occasion to have to change the battery once. But I was really surprised that the brakes. I wanted. I do have the background. I know what needs to be done. And I know that the oil should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings. And the lubrication system needs to be lubricated and. So I stay on top of that. But I wanted my front wheels. I wanted the bearings packed. And they wanted something like fifteen dollars a front or something like that. Or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it. Just to pack the bearings? Just to pack the bearings. But what I found is that they had a brake job. And they. I had them. The other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them do the diagnostics. That's free. And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it. <SEP> And they told me that my brake pads were seventy percent still good. But still it was cheaper in the long run. And. So I just got the brakes done. And I thought that was a good deal. And plus. And they repacked the wheel bearings. And they repacked the wheel bearings. But I've had considerable experience. You might say I'm uh good back yard mechanic. And I took auto shop in high school. It's been a while back. But I still have a pretty good feel for it. But one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars. I had bigger cars. And the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those. And what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand I have almost one hundred and ten. So I drove on those brake pads for forty-five thousand miles. And there was hardly any wear to them. So those small little trucks and cars like that the longevity of the brake pads is really good. <SEP> They've gotten to the point where they don't weigh very much. And the surface materials on the pads is so good. So I just did it anyway. I like to stay up on it. I just kind of stay up on it. And then if you go and just about any point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is a white golden brown. It's not dirty. I keep it that way because that is the key to the longevity. <SEP> It sounds like you've had some good experiences with that. How. <SEP> And my experiences have been kind of contrary to that. I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car. And in fact I have an eighty-seven Mustang with a three O two in it that I've beefed up a little bit. <SEP>. <SEP> And one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels. The only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were not even cast aluminum. They were just pressed aluminum. You're talking about the vibration dampener? <SEP> There's three pulleys that you change. You change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and the water pump pulley. That's the vibration dampener. <SEP> When I changed those over I put on these pressed aluminum things. And probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out. <SEP> So in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way. But not far enough to notice. <SEP> I was on my way to work one day. And the water pump pulley split laterally in half. <SEP> So there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump. And the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank. And I.
sw4928.txt:My exercise program consists of. It's a opportunity to stay alive really. Instead of trying to exist on the good health of my youth. I'm. And what I like to do is I like to stretch out. And I like to run m-. I like to run get my heartbeat up. I like to run about two and a half miles. And then I like to work out on the Bailey Life Cycle machines up here at the Holiday Spa. And I think that. I've had a regiment now for about ten fifteen years of doing that. And I kind of think it's a lot of work. But I think it's a lot of work. But I think it's the amount of effort that's required to stay healthy. I have a sedentary job. And unless you do something like that you're going to get sick. <SEP> I need to get. I'm pretty bad about that. I'm lazy. I should I know. I always say that I need to start running. And I'm going to try and do that this summer. Because I never have time. I always put it off. By the time I get back from classes it's late at night. And I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever. Because I'm getting a gut here. I got to get back into shape. Two years ago I started having trouble with my knee. And I've got. I figured it'll go away. I've had to reduce my program. And I've gained fifteen pounds. And so it's e-. I need to get back into swimming instead of running. If I can't run I should be able to swim. I'm such a terrible swimmer. And I really feel I can dedicate about an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort. But if it gets longer than that I start not doing anything. <SEP> So I got a real problem in that regard. It. Do. You obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it. I do it I guess. I'm going to do it because I want to get in shape. It's not something I really enjoy all that much that I'll probably. Once I get into it and if I get into better shape then it won't be as much of a chore to me. It's always a chore. I started doing this when I was about thirty-five. <SEP>. And now I'm fifty-five. <SEP> And I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense. Some health related thing is going to blow me away. That's the same way. I got too much weight on right now. I need to lose fifty pounds. I need to lose at least twenty. But it's just I'm busy. I'm doing a lot of traveling. And it creates a problem when you're on the road. What other programs other than running? Have you ever done anything at all? <SEP> I have. Sit-ups. Or also last summer I was doing Nautilus. Or last year I belong to a club right here. Got kind of expensive to renew. They wanted another fifty dollars. That was a little bit too much money. But doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that. What club are you with? <SEP> I'm sorry? What club were you with? It's called. City Sports downtown Washington. So you're downtown. <SEP> I go to George Washington University. You're down there on twentieth and eighteenth and F G. <SEP> It's Plaza. I'd. There's a Holiday Spa down there on K street. Something like that. But I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria. And that's pretty good. But evening time it gets pretty busy. But generally I can get in and get a program. But I need to rededicate myself to doing this. And I got a problem ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it. I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years. <SEP> And I know it's going to bite me in the ass. And so I really don't want to back off on it. It's something. I think I'm young. I should get started getting into shape. I don't want to. I want. At one point it's going to be too late to do it. When you're young you can abuse all your systems. <SEP> And you can recover. When you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away. And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye. <SEP> And so the object.
sw4333.txt:Steve with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them. Or what do you think? That's a really hard question. I do know that politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths. I. Let's example. Our friend the President right now says no new taxes. We should be cutting taxes now because of the recession. And at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases. So I know the politicians aren't straightforward. In terms of economics I'm not. It's hard to call. It really is. I never really thought that the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little. I always that the real question is are we getting a reasonable return on investment. For instance like Social Security tax or Soc-. That's tax. We're paying money. And supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us. <SEP> So that's. When I see that money taken out of my paycheck or every other week I really think that money's history. And as far as return investment that's nothing. And we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back. Someone was telling me that there's still an office staffed with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio which. I may be wrong. But I believe that the cure for polio is already founded. But supposedly once you have an office in D C and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down. And they just haven't yet. <SEP> I'm not exactly sure about polio in particular. I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio. I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. That might be the difference. I don't know. The other thing that I remember seeing on T V lately had to do with. It's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically. <SEP> For some reason historical sites with the full federal money and everything seem to appear almost as political favors to very strong politicians. It's funny because it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where Congress is able to attach all kinds of funny amendments for individual congressional districts to the main budget proposals. <SEP> And the poor President has to either accept or reject the whole thing. It sounds like you think that we'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto. <SEP> I think the line item veto is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the President uses it to get rid of this kind of waste. On the other hand it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. And just to get rid of the unimportant things. And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to where the boundary between waste and necessity is. <SEP> So I'm not sure that that will help solve our problems. But there definitely is a problem with. I forgot. There's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something. Pork barrel politics. <SEP> Pork barrel politics. There has to be some way to do it. I know state governors usually have line item vetos. And I lived in Massachusetts for a while. And when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. But Massachusetts when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially. D-. At least at the end. I don't know. I. <SEP> They were very good at first. They were in very good financials at first. And that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well. And then of course the bottom fell out. It's tough. There's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations. I guess you can raise taxes and then create job programs and whatnot. Or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot. And spare the economy. It's a hard balance. It definitely is. Even not for government even just for a small business. I know some.
sw4720.txt:I think actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have working for a large corporation. And for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit. I think it's health care. It's what. I think everybody would say that. <SEP> And if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg. Belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you. The. Sometimes I think it's more important than salary. <SEP> Do you also get dental? And I don't know if I would rank that second. But since I have three boys it can turn out to be important. You know. I know. In a given year dental expenses can really kill you. <SEP> My husband is with Northwest Airlines. And he gets the full health and dental. And we have four children. And what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous. And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it. It's. <SEP> Or maybe they don't. And then if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will. That's right. That's right. I guess that would be up there. I'm not sure how I would rank that compared to retirement. Or pretax savings was another thing that I think is a great benefit. <SEP>. And I think it's really something that the government ought to encourage more because there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in Germany and Japan. <SEP> It's a lot easier to save it when you don't get your hands on it first. When you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can offer some incentive. And if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do. <SEP> And. What about lesser benefits perhaps for you but for the women in the corporation. For example. Leave? <SEP> Do they have father leaves or anything like that? I don't think so yet. They may have just plain parental leave which either one can take. <SEP> I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short. I do too. I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks. <SEP> I think it's just a crying shame for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks. And. <SEP> She isn't recovered. And the infant needs her desperately at that point and time. There. <SEP> There ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time. <SEP> I agree. It's so important to families then. And yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up. <SEP> Especially in this day and age. That. You don't want to start over again anywhere. You're right. I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I would most like to see changed. The parental leave. <SEP> I think they've come a long way. At least some companies. Some of them my girlfriend that works for a rental car agency. And as manager they have a very very poor leave policy. And I just don't know how women do it. Particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end. They do it by shortchanging their kids. There's no other way. Unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely. <SEP> That's right. That's exactly right. People moving as much. And it's just a terrible choice. You shouldn't have to make it. <SEP> You're right. And. <SEP> One of the benefits we get of course is travel. Would I like to have that. It's wonderful. <SEP> The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere. But you can't afford to stay once you get there. Listen I have friends in a lot of different cities. If you just fly me there. I'll take care of that. That's right. You have to have an awful lot of fun. Just getting there has to be half the fun. <SEP> And I guess the.
sw4603.txt:. Go ahead. I think public service is a worthy thing. And as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as Peace Corps that promote that. <SEP> Probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts. I know that because my son is a scout now and is thinking about his Eagle. And in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world. <SEP> And you have to do a public service project. In which leadership is the key element. I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because it's talking about a requirement for public service. <SEP> And of course the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a voluntary activity. I think that might be referring to something kind of alternative to the draft. Either you have military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years. <SEP> Of course military service falls under the category of a public service. And so one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft. <SEP> But I agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended. There are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of. I-. <SEP> But I suspect that was not what they had in mind either. More of a voluntary kind of thing. <SEP> Or. I-. For years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative public service for young people to go into after high school. Kind of in lieu of the draft for people who are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want to be in the military. Say. You can go into the military. Or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things. And it's interesting because I'm not a particular fan of the military. But I have seen a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do. And they come out. And now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline. And in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can see that if I do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time I can accomplish a lot. And it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn. That they don't need to be cowboys. They don't need to be out there constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished. <SEP> And for some young men that's good. For me it would have been lousy idea because I did have the personal discipline. Why? And I went to college for four years and got out. <SEP> Why is that? But for some people that's good. I don't particular like the fact that it's the military. And the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially. As an instrument of U S policy. It's to defend the nation against external evils. That's one view. And that's another debate. But it's. <SEP> It depends on whether we figure that we have a defense oriented military or an aggression oriented military. And it seems pretty aggressive oriented. You look at the last military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States. And it was definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe. So at any rate this is getting off the topic. But i-. My point was that for people who don't want to do the military service it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and sense of community that the Boy Scouts.
sw4619.txt:. Our discussion's about the care of the elderly? That's right. That's right. What do you think is important? If you were. I don't know how old you are. But if you had parents or grandparents whatever it is who were ready who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for? <SEP> My dad's almost ninety. And he lives by himself. And he's in good shape. <SEP> But some friends of mine have gone through this. I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and where they did some things to try to keep them mentally alive. And where there were caring and compassionate people operating it. Do you have any experience with this yourself? <SEP> My wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in Minnesota. <SEP> And we go there once a year. We tend to see her there cause we're in Boston. So we're pretty far away. When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her. And it seems. The environment there I don't know too much about it. But it seems nice enough. It's hard. At least half of the residents are not mentally sound. So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain clarity. From the lack of stimulation you mean. <SEP> I don't know. We also my wife and I volunteer to go to a nursing home that's just a mile from our house. She goes more often than I. We used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there. And we have a two year old son. And so sometimes we'd take him with us. And there I would say it's the same thing. It's a relatively nice environment. But again it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but certainly have retained all of their mental skills and so on. It's must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really don't know where they are. Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern? I think yeah. I think they're relatively respectful. And concerned in as much as they can be. I've noticed some of the patients asking for things just repetitively but things that are not reasonable. <SEP> And so at some level the. I'm sure that the staff learn what's normal for this person. And so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need. It's possible. I was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need. <SEP>. I'll tell you one thing though that I saw that was really nice. We saw a husband and wife. We used to see a husband and wife in there together. And they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were. But these two were. <SEP> And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house. So it gives them a sense of identity. And so. <SEP> You walked in there. And it didn't look like how you walk into some rooms. And it's completely generic. There's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person. And that's it. But this room on the other hand they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that. And they had all their stuff from their house. And it looked like it must have been. It was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them. And it must also give them a sense of security and s-. I think part of what you're saying matches what I have read. I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who were adequately deficient in their abilities physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves. But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because they provide a lot of social activities. <SEP>. One of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities. And she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation. And. Temporary. I. That's new to me. I. I think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there. And I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like put her in there. <SEP> And there's so much.
sw4633.txt:How many children do you have now? I have five. You have five? <SEP> You do have a hard time finding time then don't you? Four of them are grown. They're in college or just out of college. So I really have just a thirteen year old at home. You sound so young. <SEP> I work at it. To have them. I try to fool everybody. I think you're doing a good job. <SEP> I just have one child. And I don't think. There's not much I can do about it. My wife and I are in our forties. So. <SEP> But it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the pivot point of the universe. I think you are right. Because I was an only child too. And that's one reason I have so many because I enjoy the big family. <SEP> And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters. And so she is sort of like an only child. And it's the same type of thing. I have a younger brother like that. I'm in my forties like I say. And I have a brother in his twenties. And I was the youngest. <SEP> So I understand how that worked. And he was treated like he had five fathers or something. That's exactly how it is. She's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her. When things don't go right she just calls one of them. <SEP> But. It's a little bit difficult though. I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more. And. Did you all do a lot of organized things like Little League soccer? We really did not. My next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion. She twirls a baton. And we did a lot of things together. <SEP> She and I did a lot of things together and flew. We have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform. And that was a lot of fun. But I guess you could consider that organized. There is a competition all the time. <SEP> We were very heavy into that. Other than that they were pretty much. And maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that. I think that's probably true. The. If you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities. And if you have a large number of children then you don't. <SEP> You can't afford to. You ca-. And there's not enough time. My son is in Little League this year. He's ten. And they practice three times a week. And they have a game. And it's just if there were more than one child there would be no way to do it. <SEP> That's right. One parent go one direction. And I'd have to go in the other. And we could only cover two at that. <SEP> I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter. And my little one also competed because really she had no choice. She had to go with me. So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing. And of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was. It was making the friends and going all the places. And it was a really neat experience. But it took our total time. I did not work when I did this. Now I do work full-time. <SEP> And it's just my thirteen year old and myself. And so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other. So. I don't think although. I think three children is probably the ideal to me. But I'm not sure I could afford three. I most certainly couldn't educate three. <SEP> I don't know how my parents did it. There were five of us. And I don't recall wanting anything in particular. But I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line. And he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and. But now my wife and I both work. And I don't believe we have as much as my parents did. And we only have one child. <SEP>. Things cost a lot more. I don't know how it is in Georgia. <SEP> And I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some. Atlanta is horrible. Is it? We have a lot of people moving here from Boston and different areas. And from talking to them they're shocked. <SEP> Wha-. And they. The housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it. <SEP> That's what I've heard. They sell their house. They stash away a good bit of money and come down here. And I work with a lot of them. They think they have really done something. Then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to where they came from. <SEP> The housing is cheaper. But that's about it. I'm surprised to hear that. I've heard very positive things about Atlanta.
sw4320.txt:. How serious is the subject of crime in your area? <SEP> Needless to say here in Washington D C this is the war zone. D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital. It's really bad here. For example the local high school they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns. <SEP> And they're starting to get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things. Luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here. <SEP> San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime. But it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the outlying agricultural towns. Because you end up having a lot of gangs forming largely around the Hispanic core. <SEP> It seems to be that gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions. That's how they bind themselves together in groups I guess. And. <SEP> The. Interestingly enough I don't think we have here a lot of gangs not a whole large group of them but just a few. Most of them centered around drug territory. <SEP> And so they're protecting their economic interests I guess. And nowadays the latest thing I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing cars at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up. And then as you get out of the car they just step up and take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house. <SEP> That's efficient. That's the latest thing. That way there's no damage to the car or anything. They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want. They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort. <SEP> Just wait for you to drive to your house. You get out. And they get in. Off they go with your car. <SEP> It's. I think they call it car jacking around here. I'd heard that phrase. That's kind of the latest thing. But every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides. So it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here. I'm from Ohio. And my wife's from Florida. So. <SEP> And we've just come from twenty years in the military which is an entirely different environment. So this is a whole new thing for us to have to put up with. And it's really scary sometimes. There aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays. <SEP> And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school. And of course the mayor of D C is having a real problem trying to. What do you do to reduce crime in a major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody. I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem. I don't know what the solution is. There's no way they can stop the drugs. And that's what's causing all the killing. <SEP> There's a couple of things that I've heard. Most of them are fairly radical in terms of what you'd have to do. <SEP> Course the reason that these kids tend to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just the end results of poverty and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else. <SEP> Because the parents aren't making a living at anything. And they see all their friends and neighbors. <SEP> And they're accidental parents half the time anyway. And their friends are driving Mercedes. And so it's actually. They grow up with that as their way of life. And I think to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised. It's illegal. But it's not wrong because all their friends do it. So maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes. And they say it's the law that's got to be changed instead of their way of life. <SEP> So I don't know. It's. I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy. I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of an actual solution to the problem. <SEP> The other social problems wouldn't go away. <SEP> They've always been with us. There's been a lot of. And I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus. But then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else. <SEP> And prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow. <SEP>
sw4733.txt:Think about this? Do you have children in school? I do. <SEP> I have two that are now just about ready to graduate from college. But I also have two that are just entering school. I think they're just pushing them entirely to fast. So you see a big difference then in before and now do you. <SEP> Or. A lot of testing? <SEP> It seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade. My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock. <SEP> And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner. I do too. I think that's awful. And I have a preschooler. I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten. And I thought how mature do you have to be. I know. What's the new criteria. <SEP> And there is a. Do you have the standardized testing now? We have all kinds of testing. And it's over and over. It's I T B S and just everything. And they test test test. I live in Plano actually. And I don't know if you've heard of Plano. But it's a very transient community. <SEP> A lot of people from everywhere. It's just north of Dallas. And it's grown in leaps and bounds. We must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now. <SEP> And most of them from other places. J C Penney's come down from New York and of course T I and Xerox from Rochester. And we just have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in. <SEP> <SEP> And it's a very wealthy community. Not that I am. But other people seem to be. And I would love to know why. But they do. They have. <SEP> You would like to know what they're doing. I would. I really would. They just have beautiful beautiful homes. And they have everything. The kids only wear name brand things to school. And it's one of these things. That makes it hard for you doesn't it. It does. It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now. And it does. <SEP> We do it to a point. But not to where she feels different. <SEP> But some of them are very rich. It's hard to explain to them why you can't. And so we just kind of have everything here. <SEP> And we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are. And so I don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas. <SEP> But the kids are expected to excel in everything. <SEP> And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first. And they're expected to be. Their parents expect it. The teachers expect it. Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system. <SEP> And if you read national surveys they're far from it. And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests. How about the kids. How are they coping with it? Not very well. They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests. <SEP> They make a big deal. To me the paper should just be put on the desk that day. And say just do this. <SEP> I just feel they do better that way. Rather than anticipating. And. <SEP> And I have older children too that now are out of high school. And they've always done this here. It's always been the same. But it's getting worse and worse. Is more pressure for everything. And I just think it's really awful. And I'm with you on that. You don't hear too many people say this. But I think it's a very long day. It is. And my feeling is that you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school. <SEP> That's right. My son came home. And he said Mom all we do is work. <SEP> We hardly ever play. And. And I don't think that's right. I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. Likewise. I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano. <SEP> I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids. Wouldn't that be great. <SEP>. And so I just find this a real problem. I think if they're going to be there all day they should find time. One of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year. And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week. And when she went back in six weeks she was ahead. So what does that tell you? <SEP> Is that right? It tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time. <SEP> And they could be using this time better. For example in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time. After lunch they have some. I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch. And then they have naps or rest period. <SEP> And I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting. That's a very long day for kindergartners. I agree. But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this. <SEP> I wouldn't be surprised. Because they don't want to send them to daycare. I doubt if they would say it was too long. That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day. <SEP> Do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care? We have them at one school like.
sw4812.txt:How do you feel about it? I don't see any problem with testing for random drugs. I myself almost am in favor of it. I work at Honeywell. And I went through a standard drug testing thing before I was brought on. <SEP> I think that's pretty standard. At least at Honeywell it is. I think it's important to insure the quality and almost the goodness of character. That kind of thing. Where do you work? <SEP> I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon. And I just came from Saint Paul. Interviewing with Three M. <SEP> And they have a policy for testing. If they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start. <SEP> And I guess the only drawback I can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem. <SEP> But i-. And that definitely happens. The drug tests they're accurate. But there's always that margin of error. And that's something to be aware of. Another thing is a lot of times they aren't that accurate. They aren't that sensitive. If you're on a prescription drug of some kind what are they going to do about that. <SEP> I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell. And I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something. I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types. Although the literature they give with you says we do this. And then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for. I don't know. What program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon? <SEP> Electrical engineering. I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida. And this is actually an internship up here. <SEP> But even for interns they do the whole drug testing thing. So. They test you before you start or before you even interview. <SEP> Or. They essentially. I sure don't. They essentially made me the offer and then did the drug testing thing after that. So it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests. And then they essentially give you the offer. And then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that. <SEP> So there's some noise on this end. I'm actually in a mall calling. So. You probably wondered. But. <SEP> What happens if you were to fail? Then do they give you one more chance or two more chances? That's a good question. I believe from what I remember of the literature if you fail they give you one more chance. They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it. But once again those things are not that accurate. So there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail. But wha-. Are you working right now anywhere. Or. <SEP>. I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and just interviewing with companies right now. <SEP> That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening. Was going to Honeywell. A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there. And he's doing an internship with I B M. <SEP> And they basically did the same exact thing. We both got our internships at the same time. And we both had to go through drug testing at the same time. So one of those things where we went through kind of an identical process. But. Do they test you right now at work too? That's one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job. <SEP> I think the unwritten rule is expect it. But they don't do it. So. That's good I guess. I don't know. I have gone to a couple of parties since that time. And while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there smoking a joint or whatever. <SEP> And that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up. But. They don't really do that. So. Is it formal policy that they said they might test?
sw4880.txt:. I'll let you start I guess. I'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing. And I've got some very definite opinions about it. Which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it. But developed a little more but haven't changed that much. What about you? Are you involved at all? I'm not. My employer does not do that. Although I had an ex-employer that. The previous job I used to have they. A few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test. <SEP> I don't know. My feeling is that when there's immediate threat to life and limb should somebody be under the influence of drugs I'd be willing to support that. For example train engineers. Because there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer. <SEP> He crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana. And I guess air traffic controllers. I wouldn't want them to be on drugs. And airplane pilots. But where it's not necessary in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property I would seriously question it. So. <SEP>. That's mine. It. I go back. To me no matter how much our company claims it's not a constitutional issue. That because this is between a company and an employee it is not a government. It's not. The Constitution doesn't apply. But it seems to me that it still should. Our company's doing it because they're a government contractor. And so some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts. And I'd. So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent? And our company has taken that and gone all the way. First off we don't have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they weren't. So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even. <SEP> And. I-. <SEP> Then. And they. So it's a complete random testing. It's random in the sense that you don't know when. It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested. And I sit at a terminal and write software all day. It certainly has no life threatening capabilities in my job. And. <SEP> And. I agree that there are jobs that are definitely life threatening. And there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper. I-. I agree. There's also the issue of. Out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of. There was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results. Or I shouldn't say high. I mean several percent. <SEP> That I will give credit to our company for in that I think there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs. And essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine or some. It's not quite that simple. But it's fairly simple. Kind of a coarse kind of test. Coarse kind of test. And then there's a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it's called. The chemotography to determine exactly what the things are. Is that done. <SEP> And. Now let me ask you this. At the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any. <SEP> I've been with this company for sixteen years now. So this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this. And. <SEP> And it has. They did that three or four years before they did it with everybody. And at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't know. But on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test.
sw4342.txt:How do you. It sounds like you've got a television going on there. I can assume that you probably watch the T V news. Is that. I almost never watch T V news. <SEP> I. I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio. What station do you listen to? <SEP> It's a local radio station. It's called K L I F cliff. Cliff I see. It's not affiliated with anything is it. It's not a network station. <SEP> Because I listen to public radio a lot. And they have K C R W which they may be trying to start their own cable TV outlet. They're getting a little feisty now. This station has a lot of just ongoing news. <SEP> And occasionally in the morning I'll pick up something like C N N or that. But I hate watching the ten o'clock news. Or. So you have a paper or something or. We have DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas. <SEP> I read it pretty much from cover to cover. How do you like it? It's been a while since I read the Dallas news. Fact last time I read the Dallas news I was in Arkansas. <SEP> I. The TIMES HERALD went out of business here. <SEP> And so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper. That must be pretty bad. How did that happen anyway? <SEP> Financial trouble. Not how. When did they. When did it happen? <SEP> I guess they closed down about three months ago. <SEP> How do you keep up? I read the TIMES LOS ANGELES TIMES. There's quite a task if you've ever run into one. They're speci-. They're very voluminous. <SEP> They're thick. If there's something you want to know it's in the TIMES and in detail. We used to have two papers here in town. And then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of just nobody was buying it really. <SEP> So there really is only one major L A now? Pretty much. There used to be the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley. And they're not bad as far as a local paper goes. In fact it was kind of weird because I met the editor while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time. It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff. He was a really cool guy. Went to Columbia University and all this stuff. And it's a pretty good paper. But it's not the TIMES. <SEP> Although I'm sorry to see some of their. There's a daily news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're expanding I guess. And occasionally I pick up TIME magazine or something if they've got an interesting lead story. But it's. I don't have time. I used to read TIME magazine a lot. But I don't read it much anymore. That's kind of a problem for them. There's a lot of people who fall into that category. <SEP> And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community. Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. <SEP> I see. The big dailies don't like to step much out of their home turf. I have to admit the TIMES is kind of provincial too. It's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover. <SEP> Now they have started here running a three times a week Plano section. And it's just sort of four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano. But it's still not an awful lot of news. I know. It was a big discovery when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County. <SEP> The way they've been handling it before they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border. I would imagine in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs. And of course they tend to cover the county. And we're not in Dallas county. So they tend to ignore places outside of the county. <SEP> I find that attitude kind of arrogant though. It's you're taking our money. But you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us.
sw4688.txt:We in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to keep track of daily finances. Way back twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer I did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and checkbooks and all this kind of thing. And we kept that going for about a month. And it became so onerous that we gave up on it. That sounds about right. So the only thing that we do now is I keep a little spread sheet of what I call the net worth calculation which is just the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth. And I only update that maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just basically when the statements come in. Just to see whether or not we're getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what. <SEP>. That's really about the extent of the kind of financial score keeping that we're doing. <SEP> It's kind of difficult for me. Because right now like most teachers I'm laid off. And. That's terrible. <SEP> So I spend most. I substitute a lot. So it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances. <SEP> But I know how much I have to bring in a month. And that's about it. That's about as far as we go. And then anything extra is more or less split up between all of us. And just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day. I see. Are you married? Are you living with people that you're sharing expenses? <SEP> I'm a single mother. I have three children. I see. So right now we get aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it. And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support. <SEP> So right now I know what I'm getting from the state. And I have to balance more or less what I get from the state with my bills and try to work as many days as possible. Any time they call me in. But I still have to figure out. If I work too many days then I lose all my state aid. And if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills. And it's like a juggling act every single month. <SEP> This week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in. But they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation. I see. So the four days before they only have a four day week. <SEP> And they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in. A- I see. They don't like to be absent before a vacation. <SEP> But I'm shopping around as far as trying. And getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. My kids are in Boy Scouts. So trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. Because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me. So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit. But we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle-class Americans are in. You're the first. My next door neighbor just lost his job. In one of these. <SEP> His company. Went bankrupt. Actually it was a subsidiary of an outfit called U S Shoe or something. It was a computer subsidiary. I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company. But they just folded it up and told him to. They took the top management and gave them jobs at the corporate front office. <SEP> And everybody else was sent packing. Hang on one second. I've got. <SEP> Somebody was knocking on my door here. It sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present. It sounds terrible to say. But at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be. In terms of keeping score of input and output. <SEP>. Do you have a computer at home. Or. We do. And we try to. <SEP> I keep track of every penny. And more or less enter it in. Every single day I'm at the computer. I see. <SEP> And it's what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet. <SEP> Do you use a standard spread sheet. Or.
sw4360.txt:Let's see. How about about ten years ago. What do you think was different ten years ago from now? I would say as far as social changes go I think families were more together. They did more things together. <SEP> They ate dinner at the table together. The parents usually took out more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity. Although I'm not a mother I still think that a lot has changed since ten years ago. What do you think about that? We. <SEP> Actually ten years from today seems rather short. But I do agree that generally society has sort of rushed everything ahead. <SEP> And I don't know. It leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that. In other words they just prioritize their lives differently. But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation. What about as far as social changes in the individual? Do you think that the individual has as much time as they did ten twenty years ago? <SEP> It depends. It's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too. I just. <SEP> How old are you? I'm twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. I'm twenty-three. <SEP> So there's maybe a five year gap between us. I think that things have been busy all along. It's just a matter where priorities are placed. And that usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home. <SEP>. <SEP> And now it's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work. Do you think it's an economic necessity. Or do you think that we're all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living? I think that's part of it too. But I do think. <SEP> Do you think people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs or. I don't. <SEP> I don't think that. But then there are a lot of people that don't have that. But that really do need to work. <SEP> I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive. And then there is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that they think is surviving which is really more luxuries. <SEP>. <SEP> But I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive. So you think it's. Which group are you saying is the one trying? I'm saying that the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the people that have the higher standard of living. <SEP> Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing middle class in this country I think that that's in my opinion the case. <SEP>. I have met people that just want to maintain the standard of living and those that really need the job. And then sometimes I often find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. A microwave a V C R a answering machine a dishwasher a refrigerator and some of those items for the. <SEP> I guess we're sticking more to social changes. But people want all of that. And not all of those are necessities. <SEP> So they're trying to. It has become a necessity.
sw4483.txt:We're supposed to talk about recycling. Basically what your personal opinion is on it. This is really for a speech research project they're doing. So I don't know. Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it? They just kicked it off down here in Sarasota county. They did? <SEP> They had been doing it. They started first in Sarasota City. Which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually. <SEP> And they've got these. Not quite. They've got these wh-. It's county wide program now. <SEP> And what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage. Yard trash. Plastic cans and glass. And then paper. <SEP> Which in the paper it's just newspaper and corrugated cardboard. Is the only thing you're supposed to put in there. <SEP> No slicks. That's good. Let me ask you this. Do they require you to presort it? <SEP>. That's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on. In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really tightly. But when I lived in Orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there. And they'd just sort it out for you. <SEP>. It was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am. So. I talked to this girl. She's an acquaintance of mine. And she's involved with. What is the name of that company. It's not Amway. But it's the other big vitamin company? Shaklee. <SEP> And she's just Shaklee crazy because it's her business and everything. And she asked. We were talking one day. And she asked me a couple of questions. What she said that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they don't want it to change their lifestyle and especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything. <SEP> That's what recycling at home sorting does. It's a little extra work. <SEP> And it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do here in Sarasota county is they've got. It can. You put your garbage in a garbage bag. And you set it out by the curb. <SEP> If you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container. Or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb. You got to tie them up and everything. The plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub. And it's about a foot and a half deep. And it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long. <SEP> This is a little container. And then they have another one the same size. That one's red. Then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods. <SEP> And so you would have to rinse out your pop cans. Otherwise you got bees and ants. And if you've got food containers or anything like that it's a big problem. It is a big hassle. <SEP> So not only do you. That's true. Up here they give you one of those containers. And you put everything in it. <SEP> So it's like if you use a lot of stuff you. It's like if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place. <SEP> This is true. So it's kind of a pain in the butt. This is true. But I don't know. That's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just. You have those garbage people that make twenty thirty bucks an hour. Have them do a little bit of the sorting. And maybe come up with a better system. <SEP> Make it a little more convenient. But. They've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here. If you want to have a nice garbage can. <SEP> And it's on wheels. And it's big. You can actually rent those? That's interesting. <SEP> Up here the city provides them. Kind of like. I think in the city they do. But out here in the county you have to rent them. <SEP> And they just add it on to your water bill or something. So where exactly are you in terms of Sarasota? Are you north of Sarasota or East. East of Sarasota. <SEP> And Sarasota is on the west coast? South of Tampa? <SEP>. I'm. About an hour south of Tampa. That's. <SEP>. I listen to this talk radio station down here. And it's really. They. I don't if you ever listen to talk radio. But those guys they just kind of get into stewing up trouble. With the callers and things like that. Occasionally. <SEP> But they get into some really good conversations sometimes. And some of it sometimes it's serious. And they have some good feedback and all that stuff. And from listening to that I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with. <SEP> And this kind of fits into the aid program. The welfare program that's going on right now. And it's.
sw4858.txt:I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't. And looking back on it I tend to think it was mostly a mistake. On the other hand the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time. <SEP> But on the whole I think it probably was the wrong thing to do. How about you? I was just in high school when it ended. <SEP> Ended up being. I was in the last lottery. And I was glad it was over by then. <SEP> I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there. Just because we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like. We. Those people that I know. I work with several that were over there. And for some of them it was just kind of not so much a holiday. I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods. And ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles. And then they'd come back. <SEP> And. But that they weren't really allowed to do anything. I. To me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway. It's funny. Tonight I was helping my kid with an essay on Stalin. <SEP> And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war. And actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was almost a personal struggle among these three. I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense. <SEP> They're certainly all leaders. And with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them. And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the people saw the cold war as you had to draw a line and defend it. Otherwise they'd get you someplace else. <SEP> Looking back it seems like that was only partly true. That there might have been a better place to draw the line. I guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end. But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him. And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war. They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward. And we were wrong. <SEP> But I. Like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable. But the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where. And as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing to a completely and winning it whatever that would mean. I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't prepared for. I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war. <SEP> The other wars seemed like a valiant war. They seemed like a valiant thing. You knew who was good. You knew who was bad. <SEP> And it was a traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you know whichever way it is. You're not. But in the Vietnam war it seems like it was. The sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad. And the. It's ambivalent. <SEP> It seems like even the people. Had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and the Laotians. And the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved. But. What about the domestic effects. I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government. And they. That pendulum started to swing maybe even too far. To the point where supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on. <SEP> And that tradition is still. It's dying now. But it's still alive as opposed to. This Desert Storm stuff may have killed it. But I think that was one of the biggest. That the domestic unrest.
sw4345.txt:I get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio. That is one of my big sources for current events information. I really like that coverage. My wife on the other hand is home most of the day. And she watches a lot of the cable news network. Have you ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED? We don't have the national public radio in my area. <SEP> I can hear it at the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away. But the F M signal doesn't reach this far. I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit. It gives you a whole different perspective on the news when you hear it from a European point of view or from the country of origin. <SEP> I agree with you too on the cable channel C N N and HEADLINE NEWS. I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper which is why I rely on shortwave and then the cable C N N. <SEP> I'm interested in the shortwave aspect of it. How do you find that the coverage from other places in the world compares with the American coverage of. How do you think that the viewpoints differ? I think a lot of it is just the fact that in the U S you're so far removed in a lot of cases from conflicts. Or it's not happening in your backyard. <SEP> So it's not as personal the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than what's on shortwave. B B C is almost. They almost take all emotions out of it when they report it. And it just. They seem to give more of just the facts than opinions. Do you think then that the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts? <SEP> Very much so. Very much so. And I think a lot of it is especially T V news. They don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to really decipher the news and to really explain it. I think it's important to interpret it. But a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting. Which approach do you find to be more useful the interpretive approach or the straight reporting? <SEP> I like the straight reporting. And then I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it. It's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it. I always think it's humorous when the President gives the State of the Union for thirty minutes. And then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard. <SEP> And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they write into it. So overall I think I would rather hear just straight reporting. One of the things that I found interesting last year during the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting some of the things that were available. There was a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory. And while he was being severely censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda. But people were really down on him for reporting the fact that this isn't a baby milk factory. How could he say it was. I think that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them. <SEP> I think people have that opinion. They want to sit down in front of the TV or read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs and find out every-.
sw4617.txt:. I say they. Probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water. If they sink they're innocent. I see. A good southern solution. <SEP> How do you feel? That's of course being facetious. But. You'd have to say that. <SEP> I don't know. The things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing. And seems to me that I think that's the way it's done now. At least my understanding of the law which isn't very good. <SEP> It seems to me that the judge does it. And I think that's probably all right in that they maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing. <SEP> And I guess also what the system will absorb. <SEP> Probably more tuned in to that. Possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty. I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole. He could have a personal prejudice. Judges are people like everybody else even though they're supposed to be impartial. That's right. <SEP> But maybe. And I think that may be an exception as well. Because I think that. Doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge? I think that's the way it is. <SEP> They decide whether or not the accused or whatever would get the death penalty. Do they have a death penalty in California? In fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month. <SEP> And there's a big uproar going on right now. The Governor has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not. <SEP> It's someone who had killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact. <SEP> I. Something like that I've got no problem with it. I guess the way I think about it it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge. It's just like if you've got a dog that's running wild and biting people. <SEP> Put it to sleep. Just get it out. It's not able to fit in. Something inexpensive. I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just. <SEP> If somebody gets the death penalty they're judged guilty. They got the death penalty. They should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal. And if not don't let them sit up there on death row for fifteen years. I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years. That. But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake. And you'd hate to be one of those. <SEP> I'm sure. The other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which again I think is the way it is now. That all verdicts. <SEP> Maybe not. I don't know. At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous. I believe it is in capital. <SEP> I think in lesser cases it's ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever. How ever many is sitting on a jury. I believe that's the way it is. But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is different than the other eleven. <SEP>. And they've only deliberated four hours or something. <SEP> And they say they're hopelessly deadlocked. And the judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet. <SEP> I'm telling you go one way or the other. That's probably an expensive trial. Six months so far they said. <SEP> Probably. Probably. I'm not sure there's a number. It's probably thirty forty thousand dollars a day worth of all the free for all. Maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote. <SEP> That's been so long I've practically forgot who Noriega was. That has been going on. My cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami. <SEP> So she follows that stuff pretty closely. But. That's interesting. She's not involved in that case. But she does. Have you ever served on a jury? <SEP> I haven't. I never have. My wife has. But I haven't. I got called. But I never got selected for a jury. I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process. <SEP> And they had some guy that was defending himself. <SEP>
sw4902.txt:And you say you have some strong feelings about the issue? I do as far as immigration as a whole goes. <SEP> I think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world. I. There just is not going to be room for all of us. We don't have jobs now. I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time. I hope you're one of the employed right now. <SEP> I am one of the unemployed right now. I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company. And I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings. But they had two thousand applications. <SEP> And I know that there are a lot of foreigners here doing my line of work. And of course I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job. <SEP> How do you feel? I'm a little bit ambivalent. And I think one of the problems with immigration policy like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in terms of what really is driving it. They're not willing to tell the truth. The same way with issues of race and things like that. Right now I believe there are two policies that the government uses to modulate immigration. Three actually. One is at the high end. They always want to be able to do some brain draining. They always like to be able to attract the Einsteins or the Professor Chou. Or. They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field. And so they can almost always find room for someone like that. At the bottom end they are always willing to let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area. <SEP> Those are two things that I think are going on. Although I don't think the politicians would tell you that. <SEP> And I think you're right in both cases. And then the third thing is the political aspect of letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico. They can not close off the Mexican border. Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would spill over to this country. <SEP> So they keep allowing the pressure cooker to let off steam. And I think probably it's pretty important right there. How do you feel about Haitian immigration? That's one of the few things I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan. I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into society. They're very difficult group to find jobs and places for. And so I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem in that they're pretty miserable where they are. But I'm not to sympathetic about letting large numbers of Haitians in. <SEP> Actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here. And it would have nothing to do with political situations. It would have to do with poverty. But. If you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population. But politically and economically. <SEP> Have you been to southern Florida? I know about it. It is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans twenty years ago. <SEP> And the two of them together. We can. It's just as well. It's hardly America anymore. On the other hand the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant. So there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in. But there's some differences in the immigrants that we're getting now. <SEP> I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration. <SEP> I think probably a great deal of what you say is true about the legals. <SEP> But the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into America. They don't bother to learn our language. And first of all they. I really feel strongly about this. <SEP> We send a lot of money to Mexico.
sw4707.txt:Not very good. It's not been a good day. I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon. <SEP> I don't know. I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn. So I hope she's turned it in. Are you eating? I ju-. Go ahead. I'll stop eating. I just barely got home from the university. <SEP> It's. Say what? I just barely got home from the university. <SEP> Tell you what we can do is I can punch the one. And then after five minutes when the voice comes on we can talk all night if we want. Go ahead. Fire away. <SEP> I love the irony of talking about this subject on April the fifteenth. But I'm afraid I'm probably in the minority. I actually don't think that we pay too much in this country. Particularly in this part of the country w-. I agree with you. <SEP> I guess I do have a bone to pick with the way taxes are distributed. I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form. And the sales tax can't. I think that's regressive. And it's kind of dumb. I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax. But on the other hand I don't mind that it's only on things that aren't like groceries and that. It's not on that. <SEP> Nobody taxes groceries. They do. Where? In Arizona. <SEP> Is that right? But we have a pretty low tax rate here. I think the sales tax they just got to do something about it. <SEP> But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes. But I guess when I see the comparison between the United States and any other western country their rates are forty-one forty-two and ours are thirty-six thirty-seven. If you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well. There's no other country that is taxed as low as we are. And I still think that having lived in Europe for awhile difference in living conditions are certainly well worth what we pay for it. <SEP>. I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I think. I was in Germany for several years. <SEP> And I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there. You mean lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes. Higher taxes. <SEP> I suppose that's true. Probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever. But. Still's that way to some extent. I think the other problem is it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you theoretically can do something about. <SEP> But I look for example. And you're not quite in the same situation. But school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world. I wish I didn't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes. <SEP>. Since I send my kids to parochial school that. That's probably a little tougher on you. <SEP> It's not quite the bargain that. But I pay them gladly. That's a decision. I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money. But that's the way Americans want to interpret it. I guess that's all right. But. I. <SEP> And if I were. When I was single and again when I'm retired I will not mind paying what it takes to keep the schools good. That's always been a high priority. I think that's just you though. <SEP> I do. That's true. I think in places like California people are beginning to find that in areas that are fairly well off if you add the people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are just looking for fun people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens. <SEP> And there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done. That seems like a cultural lapse. People always used to be willing to ante up for the schools. They. Of course I think with the graying of America we're going to see that problem in lots of places. <SEP>. People would rather increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them. But I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted. Or build roads. <SEP>
sw4784.txt:. I guess it's an easy one for me. I think there's something seriously wrong. What is it that you are particularly upset about? I think they've lost their compass. And I'm not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore. But I voted with my feet. And my kids go to parochial school. <SEP> What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in the public school system? One hundred percent of the customers care. That's one thing. Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting. And they take an relatively active part. If you're sending two thousand dollars that way every year you watch what goes on and you pay attention and participate. And you can influence the way things are. <SEP> So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of real estate or other taxes. And consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen? The immediacy just isn't there. And I also think that one of the problems. And actually I think this is a cultural problem. The problem with public education is really a problem with the culture. And I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school. And you can't get a tax levy passed. People are reluctant to pass school tax levies even when the money is needed or would be well spent because they don't have kids in the schools. <SEP> I think that's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids. I think that's the principal problem is that people no longer see it as their problem. And there's an immediate problem. It troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good. And by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes at the local level or bigger votes at the national level. <SEP> It means that you've got to be informed. And you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision. <SEP> I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution. It barely made it. I think it was added afterwards. I think the principal was education for civic participation. The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter. And you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes. <SEP> It has taken on a more profound. Economic thrust. That's exactly what I was going to say. Now there seem to be really three reasons for education. One is education for civic duty. One is education for economic reasons. And one is education for civilization. And I think that one. I'm glad that you added that one. I think that one's significant. That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor. And then I quit and got disabused of that notion. But the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs. And I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is. And I'm really sad to say this. I never thought I would have. But I really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem. And that's why I'm sort of reluctantly in favor of these choice programs. <SEP> I agree with everything that you've said so far. And the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact with public school teachers than perhaps you are except as a parent of your child. And the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing. And they are the three things that you mentioned. But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related. That's what. Like consumer.
sw4321.txt:Have you ever served on a jury? I've not. I've been called. But I had to beg off from the duty. And you? I was called. And then I was not chosen. <SEP> I was originally chosen primarily because I was a young fellow. And they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict. I don't know why. Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago. It's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason. And they kind of liked me. I looked conser- and all that stuff. And they. I don't know what they saw in me. But they saw it. But back to the issue is. I don't know. At times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun. But there too there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly in civil cases. In criminal cases I'd like to see the unanimity remain. But in civil cases I think a majority rule by jury would be sufficient. Could you give me an example of a case where you think that? <SEP> In a criminal case one in which there is assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this. And in civil law there is such a thing as misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that. A majority rule would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases. I don't know if I'm making any sense or not. I think. Are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more tangible. Or. Often there's more incriminating evidence. For instance and also too. I think I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more serious in a criminal case. Do you think that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up? <SEP> I really can't say for certain truth be known. As it stands there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both in a civil and criminal case. The documentary the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that. I don't know if you're familiar with that or not. I'm not. A fellow when he was much younger was tried and convicted and sentenced to death. Fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked. So he served out his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system. The case was reopened. And he was exonerated. I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served. <SEP> Many laws but little justice. But. And I also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that just the process of picking jurors is not always objective. Certainly not. Certainly not. And they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this. But they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires. The. Because you get up. And they ask you a few questions. Both sides do. And then you're either challenged which is. Each attorney can use that as much as they like. Or I think it's a limit now. They probably have a limit now. But they pretty much go through that. And then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve. For me it was financial hardship. But onto the thing I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing. It was always my impression that the Justice himself or herself had the final say.
sw4372.txt:Let's talk about the wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order. And after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? Actually I don't think they're out of line. Devil's advocate possibly. But you are trying to avoid paying taxes. And whether or not you agree with that law you're still circumventing it. You are legal in your circumvention of that law. What if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? What if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying income tax on something that you purchase mail order? <SEP> I don't think that's a valid argument. I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax. Naturally some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or Bryn Mawr stereo dealer. But then why not pay the sales tax. Corporations have to. Why should an individual just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax? It seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when I purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania. It's because the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It's because I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. So I go outside the area for that. And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though the revenue stream went to another state. I don't think that that's my responsibility as a conscientious consumer. <SEP> I'll agree it's not your responsibility. Is it also legal for you to do that? From what I understand from various net readings the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes into place in the next few years. It is a lost revenue stream right now. And states can use all the revenue they can get. With something like that do your arguments still apply? I think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then I don't argue with it. Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that I bought this out of state. I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania. <SEP> Which is exactly what businesses do at the present. But the point is is that businesses do that. The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question. That's a cost of doing business. The burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer. And I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having to pay sales tax on it. <SEP> That's my understanding of the way it works. Usually the person ordering doesn't pay. But the accounting department will suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. And there are some substantial nasty penalties if businesses try to avoid that. Do you mean businesses from the point of view of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing. <SEP> I-. Businesses if purchasing things mail order. <SEP> If I'm a computer consulting firm and I see this great deal on forty-six mother boards from Utah. I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. My accounting department will at the end of the month. I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania. And I know they work that way here in D C. I'm unfamiliar with that because I never see that end of the business. So my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. But if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something can be avoided. <SEP> That's true. A big hole does exist right now in that consumers can just say I forgot that. There is no well defined mechanism at all. And that it is a loss. Is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism just in order to gain the revenue that's being lost. I don't know if I agree with that. But.
sw4339.txt:Jonathan you say it's near and dear to your heart. Buying a car is something you're contemplating I take it. Fantasizing about. <SEP> Can't do it right now. Our situation is that we're a two car family. And I have a mini van we bought a few years ago. <SEP> It's got a five year loan. So that's still got a couple years to run. And the car I get to drive is a Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month. So I think about sprucing that up in a couple years if I can. They get. <SEP> What kind of a car do you think you'll buy next? <SEP> Since I just turned forty I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car something real sporty. But realistically with the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. <SEP> Something a little seating room. How about you? I think the next car we get will probably be a. I like Buicks. We have a Buick Century now. It's a nineteen eighty-seven. And whatever I get I want to have air bags both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody rather than have them stoop down to get over. So I think the four door is probably a major requirement. <SEP> And other than that reasonable cost and safety and as much economy as you can get out of a car. I'm not looking for one with a great big engine. Something that will carry it around careful is best way to describe it. Right now we've got a V six. And that seems to be just fine. I know they're coming out with some V eight now. And I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age. <SEP> I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back. So they've got some pretty powerful sixes. And V eights seem to be a return to the days of ten or twelve miles a gallon. I drive a Ford truck. I like trucks because they're spacious. And it's handy to haul things. It's not related to my business. I just really use it basically for transportation. But there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that. And it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one. <SEP> Is traction much of an issue for you up there. Traction? <SEP> Not really. It's a two wheel drive truck. And I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway. Actually pretty good way of looking at it. We had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago. <SEP> A case where there was a sort of freak ice storm. And we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car. And this is a rear wheel drive model. So we got some monster studded snow tires after that. Haven't had any problems since. What make is the mini van? <SEP> It's a Mazda. Mazda. I see. And we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and driveability. Fuel economy isn't great being a mini van. But it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others. And it's got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around. <SEP> So we've been able to do some real creative load hauling when called upon. One of my sons has a Plymouth van or that same type of thing the Voyager. <SEP> And they have a child that's five years old. And it's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff. And of course as he gets friends I'm sure that will be even handier. So I know if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value. I think that we're going to be owning a mini van for some years to come. Probably till the kids are out of high school anyway. What about all wheel drive? Is that something that you'd be interested in. Or is that. <SEP> I'd be satisfied with a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra. And even as light as that is with the small tires it's done pretty well in winter. <SEP> Again like you if conditions are that bad I probably don't want to be driving anyway. So I know I'd be happy with a reasonable four door. Again we've got the same issue with getting kids into the.
sw4370.txt:Actually to tell you the truth I think jury selection is a prime discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on finding of guilt. I certainly can't argue with that. Definitely does need some improvements. <SEP> And the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to. I think there's a limit on that. The peremptory challenges are limited to I don't know how many. I think it's Four or five. But you can. <SEP> I can't remember which. I was on a jury trial last year. Only I got kicked out as the last selection that the defense got. It seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things. I think I have a severe demeanor or something. <SEP> That. But typically everyone gets involved in the jury process. And I suppose an elitist might say you really want someone who is well educated to be able to winnow the facts from the prejudice. But it still has to be a group of your peers. <SEP> So if it's your peers and you're not educated then. So if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd have to have nincompoops to. <SEP> You want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them. <SEP> So that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him a guilty verdict if the facts warrant. <SEP> So I think the jury selection process is pretty neat. But I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards. I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have. You're talking about the person's already been found guilty. <SEP> And many times I've seen on trials they have on T V the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever. But I think that it should be up to the judge and the lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be. Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system. <SEP>. <SEP> And I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure. Also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure. I suppose you may be right on that. Matter of fact I've heard that some of the information is prevented from reaching the jury like mitigating circumstances or preceding criminal record or things of this nature that. <SEP> Preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime. But when it comes to sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side. And the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury. Is it? I didn't realize that. <SEP> At least in California they're supposed to be. Not during the trial. During the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background. But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down I think that they should. <SEP> I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial. They get too boring. So what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them. If it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time. <SEP> So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better. When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing I'm all for that for small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant. You give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things. What about white collar crimes like theft of trade secrets. I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are. <SEP> Like what? Embezzlement. Ri-. <SEP> You get a guy down the street who comes up carrying a kni-.
sw4325.txt:. What kind of experience do you have then with child care? I wonder if that worked. <SEP> Does it say something? I think it usually does. You might try. I don't know. Hold it down a little longer. And see if it. Does it usually make a recording or s-. <SEP> I don't remember. It seemed like it did. But it might not. I guess we can start. <SEP> I don't have any kids. She just had a baby. He's about five months old. And she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different. <SEP> Do you have kids? I have three. <SEP> I do. I don't work though. But I used to work when I had two children. I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit. But I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care. <SEP> But does your sister live in a big community? She lives. It's a fairly large community. She got real lucky though. He had a boss who moved into a larger office. <SEP> And she's able to take her baby to work with her. And it's a small office that she works in. <SEP> And it's a legal office. And it's just one lawyer. And so she's the only one really that takes care of the office. There's no one else that works there. <SEP> And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby. So it works out pretty good for her. How lucky. I know a lot of people around here sometimes have mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids. <SEP> But the community I'm in is not a real large one. So there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that. You either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to. So it's fairly safe. To get references and that. But. I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center simply because there's so many kids and so many. <SEP> Worried that they're not going to get enough attention? And colds and things like that get spread real easy and things. And they're expensive. And course there's a lot of different types of day care available too where they teach them academic things. <SEP> Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that. But. Take a long time to find the right place. And you don't always even know if it's going to be the right place or not. <SEP> Anything could happen. I guess after he gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care. When he starts toddling around and stuff. <SEP>. When she can't keep control of him. And he starts crawling. That's. It would be hard. I think it would be kind of stressful. It would be nice to have him around. <SEP> But seems like. Goll-. What if he cried at the wrong time. Or the phone rang at the wrong time. <SEP> But. I think she has problems with that too. When you have kids will you work? Do you work now? <SEP> I don't know. That's something I've considered. <SEP> I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time. Is that what you do? I teach my kids at home. So I'm here all the time. <SEP> So they don't go to school. Is it like. What's that called. It's correspondence school. They do it at home. <SEP> That's interesting. Do you have to have any special training? Not. It depends on the state you live actually. Some laws absolutely prohibit it. Some states say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that. Our state doesn't yet say that. And I'm not a certified teacher. I went to college. But my kids are only elementary levels right now. And so. <SEP> So they haven't been to public schools at all. One of them was for a couple of years. And so my oldest he was. And then my youngest two have never been. But we don't. <SEP> So you've never had.
sw4347.txt:So what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products? Not too bad really. I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I really didn't want it. But I got it anyway. And it was a Braun. And they were real good about taking it back. It wasn't a problem at all. So I was able to get that back pretty easily. <SEP> But I don't know. I really haven't returned a whole lot lately. Have you? I haven't had to. It's the. Every so often I'm almost pushing it myself. Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's. And it shrinks too much. And say I should have known better. I bought it from G I Joe's. And it was probably made in China by slaves. <SEP> But they. Most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway I get pretty good stuff. I think that aside from the fact all markets being internationalized. <SEP> And if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find. It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S. <SEP> I was reading. I was reading something in CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact. They were talking about cars. And about how you'd like to buy an American car maybe. <SEP> But the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever. I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger. And I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi. <SEP> So it's what are you going to do? But that's the way it is. I don't know. I personally feel that if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them that's the way it goes. And more than manufacturers should get a clue. And they should start making quality products. I think they're beginning to. The days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away. And. <SEP> That's what I thought too until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue. They've got all the cars rated. And essentially I don't see much of a trend. Just every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there. There's nothing wrong with them. And the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars. But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy. And they're pieces of junk. I know. Still at it. <SEP> That's eighty-six through ninety-one. But I don't know. Maybe they're getting better. Maybe they're starting to get a clue. They got a three year lead time. It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so. <SEP> That's just it. Technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until quite a few years down the road. But. The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer. Because technology is so volatile and changing all the time. And can you think of any other industry where in software they. <SEP> If the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail s-. Or maybe I say you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade. <SEP> It. They keep up with it pretty quickly. And that's a real good thing I guess. <SEP> I don't know. And the hardware all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity. And the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along. <SEP> They're kind of the leaders right now. I used to see all those commercials for Windows. And you're they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name. Why don't they just say almost a Mac for half the price. <SEP>. They'd sell more if they were honest. Almost is the key word there too because I've used both. And I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all. It's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. Base. <SEP> That's true too. <SEP> But I don't know. I've gotten a little bit out of the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home. I do use a Mac at work. But I really don't do much with it at home. But. Apple's sort of making a s-. And they're ones were. Growling consumer need to worry about the Mac they're getting. If you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back. They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive. <SEP>. You sound like you must work in the computer business. I have one. I do desktop publishing at work. And I have a machine at home. And I belong to the user's group. And I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out. <SEP>. But technically I'm not actually in the industry. I don't work a computer company. I'm an abuser. <SEP> That's all right. But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to keep up with the changes as they happen. That's true. <SEP> Something that I find uncomfortable is you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer. And you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for. Let's take the example the modem for. What baud rate do you get? It used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-.
sw4548.txt:Actually. I don't think I'm in the majority in Texas. I don't think I agree with. <SEP>. You don't believe in it? I wouldn't say that. I think I would have said that a few years ago. <SEP> When I was younger I thought it was a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have capital punishment. But maybe slowly changing my opinion. I'm not thoroughly opposed to it. I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment. But I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought. <SEP> You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A girl I hang out with. She has very black and white opinions. There's no gray in her opinions. She probably would agree more with you. But I don't know. I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again. I've never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family. <SEP> But I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done. And we see that more and more. In our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl. <SEP> That's fourteen years old. What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult. I certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose. I'm not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail. But. <SEP> It doesn't. But it costs less. That's a factor. <SEP> And. To me it is. I work and I pay my taxes. And I lived out in Texas for a little while. And they're. And that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia. You guys are a lot more for to each his own even than we are in Georgia. But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part. If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine. <SEP> But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore. <SEP> I. The cost is something. But I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime. And I guess I would like. I don't know. The European countries certainly none of them have capital punishment. And they don't have a crime problem either. <SEP> You can't. They don't execute anybody in Britain or France. And I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either. And they don't have the crime problems we do. I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two. I guess what worries me about capital punishment is when I see people enthusiastic about it and sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing. And that bothers me. <SEP> You might be right. But it. But. I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch. <SEP> I would never in a million years want that job. But I do believe it's necessary. And I. <SEP> On the one hand I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing. And I couldn't pull the switch. But. Actually I wha-. The other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else. I think it just becomes a symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians. So. <SEP> I would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed. Like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country. <SEP> I'm not so sure of that. I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around. <SEP> What's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing? I guess I'm. My view of. My. I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that costs and other factors justify executing people. <SEP> Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture than anything else. And I've also never been a victim although I have two friends whose wives were murdered. And I can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case. <SEP> If it ever touched my fam-.
sw4318.txt:Before the one will take. Let's see. I guess I can start. We're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing. Are you really? So I'm looking at something larger than what we have. We've got an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and an eighty-nine Horizon. So I'm looking for something bigger. <SEP> Which are both kind of small. We were thinking mini van for a while. And we're looking at some just four door five passenger sedans as well. <SEP> Are you looking for an American car. Or you open to buying foreign cars? I don't really have a preference either way. It. I guess the American cars had a bad reputation. But I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had. <SEP>. <SEP> Personally I have a Japanese car right now. And I really like it a lot. I think the Japanese really build good cars. And I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole buy American keep American auto workers working right now. But I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our car manufacturers have for a while. <SEP> If I were to buy another car I would be partial to buying another Japanese car. But I would also look at American cars. But when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also. And I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product. Even if it's just details it seems like they. So if I were. <SEP> I j-. There's a door seal that doesn't quite seal. And you have to take it back every once in a while. It's clearly just a design problem there. It is. I'm kind of. Right now. The next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car. I would really like to have a sports car. I don't have a family. So I don't need a mini van or such to haul people around in. <SEP> So I'm looking for more a two passenger car that. Like a Miata or something like that? I like the Miata. But I don't like it enough to buy it. I would buy something. Actually the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car. <SEP> But something along that lines. Interesting. Because I have an economy car right now which is okay. But I think I'd like to move on to something a little better. <SEP> That's interesting. I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for size and safety and then mileage. Probably. <SEP> That's. When I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage. And I was looking for dependability and something that was going to last a long time. For the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was worth that money. <SEP> I think in terms of computer terminology I look at price performance and things like that. And then a little bit at life expectancy. But it depends on what you pay initially. <SEP> But I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger. That's right. Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage. <SEP> And she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton. It's. We had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles. But the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it. <SEP> But. <SEP> I've had one or two American cars I think. And they were okay. I had a Pontiac once. And I never had a problem with it. But my mother had a Dodge at one point. And I had driven it a few times. And I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from. <SEP> Actually I had a Dodge Omni at one point. And that was what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality car. <SEP> I guess you'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car. That's interesting. But. It's hard to beat some of the. I guess in particular we're looking at a ninety-one Corsica buy back at a G M sponsored auction. But I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after they've used it for six months and put twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it. <SEP> And you can get those for eight thousand bucks if you. <SEP> Which is a good deal. Because I guess. Ninety-twos granted but the new ones. Fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot. <SEP> So all the depreciation has been taken off. And the dealer comes out okay. That. I don't know what kind of hit they take on it. But sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it. But I don't know. <SEP> I'm sure they did. We keep looking at that mini van. It's just. We can get a Caravan at twelve five. <SEP> But that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now. But it's interesting. But I don't know. If it seems to be.
sw4691.txt:So. I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been. It. Let's put it this way. We've got the New England Patriots up here. So. <SEP>. They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years. <SEP> Why? Partly due to ownership. Victor Kiam owned the Patriots for a period of a number of years. And he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something. And they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth. And it recently was sold to some other people. So hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and keep the Patriots in the New England area anyways. <SEP> It will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you. I've been to a few games before. <SEP> You're from Texas. So you've got two football teams down there. <SEP> It depends on where you're from in Texas. I live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned. I see. <SEP> That's how it is. There's that type of segregation? It's divided. <SEP> It really is. So we've got our Cowboys here. And I don't think anybody roots differently. But I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno. Do you. <SEP> And he is for the Raiders. L A Raiders. So. Do you follow professional sports at all? <SEP> I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well. But I've been trying more this year. I think I know a little more than I use to. <SEP> I never knew very much at all. So I'm trying. It's a good past time. Particularly football. They say football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field. And supposedly psychologists say that men take out their frustrations by watching football. And they get together with a bunch of guys. And they have a good time and everything. And that's suppose to be some of the male bonding and the male instincts or something about the. <SEP> So I shouldn't even try to do it? It's good in terms of a contest. I think that. I personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport. It has the speed. <SEP> And the hand eye coordination. And it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey. So we. And. That's. We're a big hockey area up here. I bet up here in New England as well as in the Minnesota area. <SEP> But. I don't even think we have that in Texas. What hockey? <SEP> We might. Do we? You probably know. I don't know. There's no hockey. There's no. <SEP> Nobody talks about it. So I don't think we do. There's no professional hockey teams in Texas. And we have a soccer team that comes and goes. We don't even have that very much. So. I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now. <SEP> They have this World Football League. You see we have the N F L that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams. There are those teams that play in National Football League. But now they have what's called the World Football League. And they have all these teams from. There's a team in London. And there's other European teams. <SEP> And there's teams in the United States. And they're playing now during the summer months. And it's really overkill. And there's only so much football you can watch. <SEP> I like to do. I don't like to watch. That's good. I don't like to watch anything. So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff. I think it's an excuse to do nothing. <SEP> And I can see what you're saying about the male bonding. And the guys get together. And that's kind of cool. That's fun. <SEP> But it can get really overdone. Have you ever been to a professional football game? I have. Have you? <SEP> I have. Did you do the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole. Actually. That's what you got to do. We talked our. <SEP> I've done that for college football. You the. The same thing. <SEP> We talked our wives. There's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games. And we talked our wives into going with us one time. And they had a real good time. And it was basically for the social atmosphere. And that's the thing. You go three or four hours before the game. You go set up. We set a table up. We do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more. <SEP> But that whole. It's not so much the contest itself and the game itself. But it's the whole atmosphere of going to a game. I-. <SEP> That you miss sitting home in your parlor with a six pack of beer and some potato chips. That's right. You miss that. <SEP> That's right. And any professional sport I think you miss that. <SEP> The atmosphere of being there. In high school I went to every football game. And I twirled. <SEP> And I didn't.

sw4830.txt:You want to go first? You can start. One of the things they talked about was what do we think about a judge making the decision? <SEP> And I really don't agree with that. I think that the trial by jury is better having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time. You know what I mean? <SEP> This topic is kind of mute. There's no way. We couldn't survive in a trial system without a jury. <SEP> One man one woman can never be objectionable in every case. That's it. Every person has their opinions. And that's why jury selection is often very difficult. I feel the other thing too. They were saying what new ways could it change the system. I really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal. <SEP> If you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught point blank in the crime. There's no question. It's beyond a reasonable doubt. All these things. We've gone through this over and over again. <SEP> They shouldn't allow an appeal. And it can go on for ten twenty years. <SEP> I think this is a little ridiculous. <SEP> I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers. That's right. I work for a law firm. I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining. <SEP> If someone is ill. Plea bargaining is a different story. <SEP> Plea bargaining is something completely different. That actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up. I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think all of the whole criminal system is messed up in that regard. People who commit crimes that they. I don't know how it works exactly. But they get lesser sentences. And I understand that the jails are full of people and that they have to do something. <SEP> But I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it. You know what I'm saying? That a lot of states don't have capital punishment. <SEP> And I think they should. We do. And I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people. And all. <SEP> They're caught dead to rights. I just think that they've taken a life. And they should pay for it with their life. When you're saying as far as the appeal procedure was concerned. <SEP> We just have the case. I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry. His last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up. <SEP> So his appeal was denied. And two days later he got out of jail. For cocaine possession. It. <SEP> But that was absurd. There was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence. I know that. And I don't know. What would you do to change it? To make it better? <SEP> The only I wa-. The appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd. There's no way that could work. I don't agree with that at all. But. Imagine the guilt that person would have. Burned out. <SEP> There's no possible way that you could feel good about yourself. <SEP> If you had to do something like that day after day. No one would want the job. Not really. <SEP> And like I said everyone has their opinions about every case. Do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights. I feel that everyone is entitled to a trial by jury. That right s-. Supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you. <SEP> Were there witnesses? In other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were. <SEP> That you can't remove the jury regardless of the case. You could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place. <SEP> And there's still mitigating circumstances. I.
sw4319.txt:What are your benefits like at your job. And how do you feel about them? Pretty good actually. I work for Hewlett Packard. And they have a pretty good benefits package. In fact they're kind of known for having good benefits. The pay isn't fabulous. Although I saw a survey recently. And I'm making actually over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me. That's good. <SEP> What kind of a degree have you got? <SEP> I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering. So. And I'm not a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff. <SEP> Anyway our benefits are pretty good. We've got stock purchase program and a. That's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a pain. But there's a four O one K plan for sheltering some taxable income. <SEP> There's. How long have you been with them? <SEP> I've been with them for seven years. That's good. <SEP> And the best thing is four years or five years you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything. So it's not t-. But there's several medical plans to choose from that cover pretty much everything. I don't get sick that often. So I don't pay much of it. And I pay five dollars every time I visit the hospital. <SEP> They don't cover eyes though. And I have contact lenses. So that's kind of a pain. <SEP> But I can live. But for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered. <SEP> So that you've got small things to gripe about. <SEP> And. That sounds like you must feel really good about it. And the dental plan is fabulous. The dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because. <SEP> I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that. But that's not the case. <SEP> So I guess nothing. It's fabulous. The. What about you? I work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory. I also have a part time job at a law firm. And I get no benefits from them at the part time work although they pay better per hour than my sort of quote real job does. <SEP> And benefits through the government are really. They're not the greatest. Before I got my degree. <SEP> I'm a computer scientist. And before I got my degree I had done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington. <SEP> And at that time I was in gravy city. The law firms in this town. For a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties. And benefits were just amazing. <SEP> And we had everything paid for. And with the government it's not quite that nice a deal. But it's okay. What we have to do is we have to pay about twenty percent of our costs. And it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing. And the plans that are available to us range from kind of mediocre to really sweet. So I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good plan at this point. But it could be better. That's for sure. But there are other things that you get when you work for the government in terms of more relaxed atmosphere. It's really nice for me anyway to be able to work in a research atmosphere where I don't have to worry about academics or anything like that. And so I'm really kind of happy about that end of things. It's. <SEP> One of the things with my company is that they've got a reputation for a lot of job security. And there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do. So there's. I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company. <SEP> And I haven't had to move my residence to do that. I still live in San Jose. And. That's fabulous. It. That's interesting. Because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area. <SEP>. He lives in Andover. <SEP> And the work that he. He's specifically an engineer and does work with the Hewlett Packard machines that do sonographic imagining. And I've been over to see his complex over there. And it's amazing. <SEP> It's all ecologically designed. And he seems really really happy with the set up. And. <SEP> In fact I know a guy who works at Andover who I used to work with out here. And he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position. Kind of interesting. Anyhow.
sw4362.txt:Having. Sort of the reason we're going through the school system. I seem to be younger than most people who talk on this thing. I'm just graduating from college. I didn't really perceive much of a problem with the school system. However when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and ad-. You can compare just about thing to Japan. And we look like we don't have anything. It seems to be not difficult enough for students. Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough. However if it weren't for our needless competition with Japan I'd think that the school system works at a pretty good pace. I don't know. I haven't. It's been seventy-nine since I was. At high school. <SEP> And I've seen things change. I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually. Because I wasn't really listening to the world go by back then. So it's hard to compare. You know what I mean? But it seems like when I lived in Chicago. I've lived down here. I hear the dropout rates from the schools. <SEP> And I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year. And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth. <SEP> I've seen so many different things. So many different bad reports coming out of the school system. And I recognize that there are good schools out there. Somebody's getting a good education because we continue to employ people. <SEP> But I don't understand why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. I don't pretend to understand that either. But I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then again I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Because the dropout rate is in those areas w-. It's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle where you have the dropout rate and crime and general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better. So the other two a-. They're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly to me is a kind of government thing to fix. But it's just like I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. It's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school. I don't know if I blame it on the school. I think I blame it on a couple of different things. I think I blame it on the school system. <SEP> That's I meant when I said the school. I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. Although I think that. I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than. They do quite well for themselves. That's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district were well paid. Not all school districts are well paid. But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid. I know one family that's got. They're both teachers. And they both have second jobs that they work in the afternoons. <SEP> They both work all summer full-time. And from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each. <SEP> It. That family is making over a hundred grand. And I'm. I agree that teaching our kids is important. However these people who only work eight hours day at it from seven to three. <SEP> And they only work nine months a year. And they get an awful lot of breaks in between. And that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that. And I don't even have kids. That's true. But there's. You can always play games with talking about look at this. My tax dollars are paying for this. This is wrong. But when you're w-. And there's really not much you can directly do about that. I think that if there is a problem with the school system from it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well paid. That perhaps that might be one area that could be improved. W-. You have other professional jobs. And this is a profession. And as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on.
sw4886.txt:Are you in the middle of anything? I'm not in the middle of anything. I've just. About the last thing I did. About maybe close to a year ago now I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house. So I guess that. The whole thing? <SEP> That was fairly large undertaking. It's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house. Did the framing and all? We did it all except for the sheetrocking. <SEP> That was the only thing we didn't putting the ceiling up and things like that. We weren't sure how to do that. And. Maybe you and I should get together. Because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing. And I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work. That's the exact opposite. We put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up. We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work. And that's it because you have get those joints to go together. Ye-. <SEP> And whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that. We didn't know a thing about any of that. And so. My wife wishes I hadn't done that. <SEP> It looked very hard to do. So. <SEP> We figured well just. I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional. So we left it to somebody who does it for a living. But. I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Probably so. And we'd never done it. <SEP> So we just left it alone. But that's. I guess I'm only twenty-one. So my vast experience of home owner's knowledge is not very much. So it's just what I have to do more or less around the house for my parents. So. You framed in new square footage. Or was it stuff that was already enclosed? <SEP> It was brand new. Brand new. We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house. So it was. And you knew how to do the framing? <SEP> My dad knew how to do most of it. We'd gotten a couple of books. And then he just started doing it. I don't know. He did all the flooring himself. He put the whole floor in. And then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there. And then we put not necessarily a garage but just a. After we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less. It's not enclosed. It's just somewhere to drive another car to park. And it's. Do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground? <SEP> It's off the ground. On the piers? It's on about twenty-two inch piers something like that. Did. <SEP> You had those poured. Or you did them yourself? <SEP> Those are. We did those ourselves. So. You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete? <SEP> So. It's. The last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of. Those are. I've done one. I helped somebody do one of those before. Those are. You can buy them in kits. But we didn't do that way. But it's. I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job. <SEP> Those are nice. They're pretty forgiving. You can always tear stuff out and redo it. It's a. That's not near like building a house or anything. <SEP> But. Those are nice. Especially when you get done you've got something. I don't know. I like them. You just sit down on the deck and do whatever. Have a barbecue. <SEP> I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and a backrest and all that stuff. Or. I. <SEP> That sounds nice. All done by yourself. I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes. <SEP> Designed. So we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts. And then the rest of it I just did. A contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work. But it was pretty. It was about four or five hundred square feet. The same size as the addition that I just put on. So. <SEP> That's a good size deck. So. That's. It's not that expensive. I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and no less than that. <SEP> That's not. Cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together. That's good. That's not bad at all. Didn't have to. <SEP> The wood may. It got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is. To get good lumber it costs. I don't know about Dallas but even in this little town it's not cheap at all. I was surprised. I'd be surprised if it wasn't cheaper where you are. It's probably more there. It probably comes from where you are. <SEP> It probably does. Most. I'm not sure. But. When I drive through that area that's all I see is pressure treated lumber yards. <SEP> It's nothing but woods down here. <SEP> I haven't. I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington actually. But that was just when I was a kid. So I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore. But I don't know we're a college town. So that doesn't help us out any. East Texas. <SEP> We have. Gas is a dollar twelve a gallon. So that's probably about what you're paying. So. My current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard digging it out and laying sand and putting pavers on top of that. So. <SEP> That's a lot easier. You've got something going all the time.
sw4341.txt:Looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment. The problem I have with capital punishment is that it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime. But I don't think that it really actually does that. I don't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are committed without any thought to the consequences. And they don't stop and think and say maybe I shouldn't do this because I might get the gas chamber or something like that. They worry about it afterwards. And then they try and get out of it. And how about you? I think that in some cases it is warranted. I do too. <SEP> And I don't. I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not. You still have to do it. I. I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer. <SEP> Or. So you're in favor of capital punishment then. <SEP> For some things. I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood. <SEP> Needs to be punished or eliminated from society. <SEP> You can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. <SEP> And then do it all over again. <SEP> And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. Have to agree with you. And I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because you still see them committing the same crimes. But I tend to agree with you that we should have it. I don't know that it's always effective. But I guess we're kind of stuck with it. It's a difficult problem to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime. But then I think that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. Like for example you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them. <SEP> <SEP> And I don't think that would really warrant capital punishment. <SEP> Do you think they should be punished at all or go to prison. Because they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense in a case like that. It is to a certain extent. <SEP> But I think. I don't know because. I know they put them in jail sometimes. I think in s-. And it just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. <SEP>. <SEP>. I wonder what you think about this. And unfortunately we don't get to do it. But it used to be a long time ago if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family then if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to execute that person. And I know that if somebody had done something to my family I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them. But I don't think that's done much anywhere. That's kind of drastic punishment. <SEP> I think that would be kind of drastic punishment. And. Might make you feel better. But. <SEP> But one thing I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated. <SEP> But like I said if someone is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society. <SEP> Because they're a danger to everybody else. That's interesting. I have to agree with that. <SEP> But. There's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that aren't really a danger to society. And. And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison. <SEP> Probably more of them then the other way around. Interesting. I don't not sure. I'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it. I'm not sure what kind of capital punishment we have here. I know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment. <SEP> And I'm from South Carolina.
sw4642.txt:I try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair. Actually that is really a sore spot with me. I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving. But ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal. And not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal. <SEP> And it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea. But I. <SEP> So do you have a car? Do you have a car? At that time actually I had a Volkswagen Rabbit. <SEP> And it was a real lemon. Subsequently I got a Buick Century. And it wasn't as bad. But last year I bought a Honda Accord. And I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance. And that is it. And it's wonderful. <SEP> We used to have a Honda Accord. And they're good. They're really good cars. Every time I get taken to an auto repair place every time I go I get taken. Bad. Woman goes in. And they go we got a sucker. Let's see how much money we can get out of her. <SEP> That's what happens every time. So. What do you have? <SEP> I have a Pontiac Six Thousand. All the more reason to have a Honda. But our Honda just got old and just wore out. It was eleven years old. And it just out of it. So. So you bought a Pontiac? <SEP> My ex-husband's. This just happened a couple of weeks ago. He's my ex-husband. But just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car. And everything is wrong with it. The power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks. Thi-. How old is the car? Eighty-seven. <SEP> And he just doesn't take care of things. But I was awarded the car. So. There is a man in my church that is a mechanic. And I can trust him. So he is trying to get things fixed on it. But it's just leak leak leak everywhere. But I hate to go into a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not and charge me twice as much. The last time I took it into a repair shop. The man told me I needed a master cylinder. So I said okay. And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars. And then about a month later a man was looking at my car. And he asked me. Not a repair man but just a friend. And I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on. And he looked at. And he said that's not a new master cylinder. <SEP> And I didn't even know what one was. And he showed it to me. And it was old rusty just awful. It was no more new than nothing. So apparently it was the same one that was on there. More than likely. Probably filled the brake fluid up. And that was it. <SEP> That was it probably. It was ve-. I was so irritated. And that's happened to me more than once or twice. Just about every time I've went in somewhere. So what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service. And you can hardly find one. <SEP> The guy that's doing most of my car now goes to my church. And that's the only reason I go to him because I know him. And I know he will tell me the truth. Because he doesn't even charge me for doing it. So he's not going to take me. <SEP> I just pay for the parts. And he does it so. That's wonderful. You're lucky. <SEP> I am. So I don't know. I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all. We took our Honda to the Honda dealership. And they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car. And so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars. They told us we just had to have one. And we bought one. We didn't no more need no new engine. Give me break. <SEP> So it was not good. And.
sw4626.txt:. How are you? You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget? I feel like I am from Mars. I'm fifty years old. And I've been divorced for eighteen years. But I've two kids and all. But I've never had a budget. And I don't do any planning. And I don't know. <SEP> I don't have a long-term financial plan. I don't try to control my expenses. But I'm glad you're a stranger. <SEP> That sounds kind of like me. But really I'm curious how other people live. So maybe we should start with you. What do you do? About the same thing. <SEP>. Maybe they're going to arrest us both. I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children. And we live from hand to mouth. We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we due for the next month. <SEP> A couple of times we've tried some things. And they worked. But I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it. The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope. <SEP> And when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area. And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent. <SEP> It was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money. And we did that pretty successfully for about three months. And then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope. And in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do. The. I had a part-time job around fifteen years ago seventy-six. And this was a sort of a career shift at the time. And so I was willing to take a half time job to do that. And I actually did. My bank account would. I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month. But I had miscalculated. I didn't keep a balance. It's one of the problems. <SEP> I never had to in the past. I always kept plenty of money in my checking account. But when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money I sometimes would just. Things would get to tight. And sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet. And every time I spent money cash mostly I would write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning. <SEP>. But I would forget to write the things down. And I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data. I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever. <SEP> I even find now with the automatic tellers I'll go take money out of that. And then I forget to take that out of my checking account. <SEP> And. So I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there. <SEP> And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make. The. I have to say that. Let's see at this point on I don't run out of money. And it. And I don't. Someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have. And I think my strategy if I may is to not spend money. I don't have expensive tastes. I don't go out. I buy a car. The last car I got rid of I'd had. It was nineteen years old. People were embarrassed for me. It was a good car. And. <SEP> But it was still running. It was great. My mechanics loved it because it was a sixty-five Buick. And it just wouldn't stop. And it. I just didn't feel the need for a new car. It isn't like I couldn't afford one. And now I don't. I tend to eat expensive food. I don't mind buying a good steak. But for me I only do that every week or maybe once a month. <SEP> You buy a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous twelve dollars a pound. You buy less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars. To me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that. <SEP> Not very often. But I'm just saying as a single person that's a drop in the bucket. And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up. If you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to. That's right. So that's one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing. <SEP> A lot of.
sw4936.txt:Why don't you start? I don't know. I refinished a couple of old dressers that were handed down. It's nice tongue and groove construction. I've been pretty successful with that. Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that? <SEP> What? Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing? I've done some other things too. I've done both. <SEP> My wife has picked up a couple of things saying if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture. And we've done it a couple of times. I guess that we've been fairly successful with those. That's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it. <SEP> That's a good way to get started. I have a really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital liberated it after a fire. And we stripped it all the way down and refinished it. And it turned out to be a nice desk. Maple top or something of that sort. <SEP>. <SEP> I put together a rolltop desk from scratch. A kit. I'm jealous. <SEP> Still had to cut it and everything. But it was fun. I do things that might be too crude to be called woodworking. I've built my own deck and things like that. <SEP>. I've done the same. Like the trim around the house the baseboards and things like that. And I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too. <SEP> I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive. And so I do have a band saw and a router and things like that out in the garage. But I can't say I use them very often. <SEP> I'm looking at trying to get a router right now. They come in handy at the most unusual times. Putting doors in is the time when I'm. I bought myself a template for making mortices and doors. And that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel. <SEP> I'll bet. But I've also used them for rabbeting because rabbeting on my radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain. So I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it. And now I use it twice a year maybe. <SEP> My brother's used it a lot for making drawers. I don't know. The big. What's your opinion of what a good router is like? I. I guess it. <SEP> Because he was tell me the ones that you dial in aren't all that great. They've plastic parts and stuff. The ones that what? That you dial in on the side. I have never even looked at one closely. The little use that I've gotten from my router I would spend my money on the bits. <SEP>. I have a medium quality Craftsman router. And the. <SEP> How strong is it? It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than three-eighths of an inch at a time. But the problem is that as with. Any time you buy a tool as a package the bits that they give you are low end. Don't they. <SEP>. <SEP> So a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars. And if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it. Because e-. I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself they won't last. And I've never had the bits sharpened. So. That's a thing to consider is to. <SEP> They really get hot don't they? And they dull after awhile. Especially I did some cabinets in ash and oak. And that wears a bit down. We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen. <SEP> <SEP> And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth. And routing hardwood will take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast. So. <SEP> I've cut some one by eight oak before. Was that fun. That's. Big solid pieces of oak are just tough. And then you take the blade to get sharpened. <SEP> That was with a circular saw. <SEP>. Is this going to be fun? I've used mine on treated wood. And now all my blades need sharpening. Because treated wood will also chew them up. <SEP> Treated wood can really make you sick too.
sw4698.txt:Actually I've been involved in electronics a long time. In computers. And I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home. Up until maybe about a year and a half ago. I got one for my son. A Macintosh L C. <SEP> It's a real easy to use color computer. And I got a very nice printer that goes along with it. And he uses it for his school work. I'm currently in school. So I've had an I B M clone for a couple of years now which I've been continually upgrading. And I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it. And I can't really. I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer simulation or analysis. So. <SEP> It's very essential for me. Schools have them. But lot of times so difficult to get on them at school. It's much more convenient to have one at home. Where you going to school? At Georgia Tech. I see. <SEP> So. In engineering? So that explains all the computer assignments. <SEP> It. Do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work? I have some games of course which I play on there. And I have a program which allows me to access a weather data bank. So I can check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby. So it provides other means other than just strict computations and so on. So. Do you have a computer for yourself at home? I just have one for my son. And I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing. <SEP>. Tha-. At work I'm a technologist. And I in the past have done a great deal of system development just through software development programming. But now I find myself using the computer. Even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communication system. <SEP>. Do you use Email and like that? Emil probably pulls down a third of all my time. <SEP> It's. I have modem night computer. So I can log into the network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which can be useful. But. That and word processing is. While I tend to. Obviously I do almost all of my report writing on my computer whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. So it's really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember. Actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out. <SEP> And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high. So. I'm a old-timer. I did my Master's thesis on a typewriter. I rented an I B M Selectric. <SEP> And it was a pretty big deal. It must have been tough. It's a little bit strange for me. I did my Master's thesis last year. And I did that on a computer. And it seems like. I just can't imagine how people did it before. It must have been just so much work. It was just a completely different world then. <SEP> So you used your son's Macintosh then? Do you like that kind of computer? I like it. I like it from a distance really. I see the packages on it that are available. And it's nice. I really don't use it myself. When I come home from work I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things. <SEP>. So I let my son do it. And of course there's an intellectual evolution taking place where. <SEP> It's sort of a joke. But it's really true. The old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot. And the kids they just take to it like candy. If the interface is there so that it's fun to use and the challenge.
sw4618.txt:Go ahead. Have you every been tested for a new job or anything? I haven't. But in my job I'm a nurse and we are allowed to be. This is the rules that they can do this anytime. I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested. <SEP> So it's just sort of. They can if they. They can if they choose to. Have you had any experience with it at all? <SEP> Not really. But I've always worked on a university level. But a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff. So what do you think about that? I don't think they're very accurate. Because I know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test. And I know they changed afterwards. I know of that too. And I also know that things like antihistamines Sudafeds things like that can really throw it off. And you can not get a job because of it. And they may not tell you the reason why. <SEP> I had a friend. It didn't cause her any problems with her job. But it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen. But what it was was she had been in the jungle. And it was some Malaria medication. And she tested positive for that. And so it really is a dangerous thing that way. Because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job. And they weren't told why. But a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing. Or they would tell you. Or this person never use any drugs. <SEP> I always. I thought you got called back if you tested positive for more tests. You should. Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something. I have real mixed feelings about it. I don't know. Do you know how wrong they are? Is there a margin of error? The accuracy? I don't know. I don't know. But I know there are a lot of things that can influence them. And I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time. <SEP> And if you could show that. I interviewed for a job recently. And I was taking Entex. And my doctor gave me a prescription for it. And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you. And it didn't come up that I needed to do it. But this could happen to anybody. And if they would just say this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything. <SEP>. So I don't know. <SEP> And I'm not so sure they are that needed. I'm not sure either. Ye-. The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it. Because they say they can spot check. <SEP> If you're using it while at a job I can see a problem. But the occasional person then it's almost an infringement of your privacy. It sort of is. And this is it. This. I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways. As a health professional I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs. <SEP> So as a patient I feel we probably should be protected. But on the other hand there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too. So I guess you have to have trust some place along the way. You can't go around testing everybody for everything. <SEP> So I don't know. And I think it could be used to hassle somebody. If someone was out to get you I think that a company or a boss could use this. They could keep on doing this to you or something I guess. I can see where it could become a problem. And it seems like now they have tests. I guess they can test your hair. And they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago. <SEP> But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. So. <SEP> I know. That's the other thing. A lot of people as kids or young people get into some things that they get out of later on. And I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. There's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult. <SEP> But you can't say it was wrong at the time. I think that's true. So that probably wouldn't be too good either.
sw4312.txt:What kind of music you into? I have a pretty wide taste in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to lot of different forms of music. In fact it's easier for me to say the types of music that I don't like are opera and screaming heavy metal. The opera it's right on track. I like classical. But I can't deal with opera at all. <SEP> And heavy metal it's noisy. I'm into some industrial music that's a bit even harder than that. It's got to have a point to it. <SEP> I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to. But the basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you gets a little annoying. <SEP> What kind of progressive stuff? <SEP> Lot of stuff that actually has ended up becoming popular like Nirvana and. I'm thirty. So lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and the Sex Pistols and R E M that sort of stuff. R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being ultra mainstream at this point. And it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed. It's a lot of people saying that bands in that position sold out. <SEP> I think that's pretty much bull. Because R E M really hasn't changed. If it's interesting. They're producing similar music. And it's good music. <SEP> But people have picked up on it. That's good. <SEP> I think it is. I'm impressed. For a while there popular music seemed to have not a lot of point to it. I was really tired of the Michael Bolton. <SEP> Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes. <SEP> And I could go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money. But he picked the right songs. And that's about all he had going for him. Or still has for that matter. I guess. <SEP> That and a marvelous hairdo. I'm sure that sold a lot for him. That's all you really need for a lot of pop. I've kind of developed a short hatred for pop. <SEP> It just seems like there's no real point. You hear the same tune over and over again in a thousand guises. And. <SEP> It's interesting because you were saying that you liked classical music. And I like a lot of classical music. But I also dislike some classical music. And what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time. <SEP> I can believe that. What kind of things do you like in classical? What's the standard? <SEP> Stuff that I like. I like Bach. I tolerate Vivaldi. I can't stand Debussy. <SEP> I like Tchaikovsky. He can make a lot of noise when he's so inclined. And some stuff that I like. For instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition. <SEP> And that's interesting music. But it would not get performed by any municipally funded philharmonic just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive. <SEP> We're much better off playing Beethoven's ninth. That's right. We'll do the ninth. And everyone will know it and hum it. It's safe. <SEP> And it just isn't chance taking enough for me. I feel that music should take chances in one way or another and that if you've heard a piece a hundred times.
sw4876.txt:I haven't had an awful lot of incidents regarding child care. When my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek. But that's about the extent of it. But when. I really am concerned that so many of these child care places are coming under investigation for child molestation. <SEP> And I'm saying to myself you dump your little turnip off to this child care place. And they don't pay very much. And why would they be interested in your little turnip unless one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is that's somebody to molest. And that's a terrible kind of thing. And I don't think my children have ever been subject to that. But my wife didn't work. And so we really didn't have that much exposure to it. <SEP> I am a working mother. I have three children. And my children since they were very young. I've had various different alternatives child care arrangements. And like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home. And my kids are very secure well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities. So I e-. It is a problem. But as you pointed out I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities. And that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford. When our children were very young we had a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful. <SEP> And then as they got older they went to schools. And they were really all day preschools. And they were wonderful. And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things. That's interesting. But we really truly did pay a fortune. We were paying at one point about five hundred dollars a week for two children. <SEP> You must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that. I mus-. I'm a physician. As is my husband. <SEP> And I felt very good about working. I'm a pediatrician actually. But I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children. And we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think. Not all of us. You know the kind of things you're supposed to look for. <SEP> I'm an engineer. And. <SEP> I think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. And we had a really wonderful arrangement. I'm with the university actually. And they had a wonderful program that started at age three. And it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. And so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. And they had wonderful. They had things like gardens and lots of pets. And they had a four to one teacher student ratio. <SEP> So that sort of an. Most of the teachers had degrees. Five hundred dollars a week. For two kids. That's incredible. <SEP> It was incredible actually. But it was good. It. At that time there were two children. And they were in special programs. And each one was a little over two hundred a week. And then in addition I paid a little bit extra. But the kids were. <SEP> They really had some great opportunities. But tha-. W-. What you were alluding to earlier is women who work for minimal wage and really feel they have to put their children. <SEP> Sometimes they do put them in fairly low paying situations. They could. Somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare. And that's a good starting wage. <SEP> But three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care. <SEP> Even that really I think I don't. It's been awhile since I've looked at. My youngest child is eight. So it's been a little while since I've looked into actually daycare centers. But they are. The good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since. We used to pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit. But mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven. So that. <SEP> I guess baby-sitters now are up at five dollars an hour? Something like that. <SEP> But you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children. It has been a real. There have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences. And I think they have captured a certain market. Again the. But then there are baby-sitting groups. As a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections. As you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around.
sw4728.txt:I don't know what you drive now. What do you drive now? I have a Ford pickup. And the family car is a Dodge Caravan. Because we have three kids and they're under thirteen. <SEP> So. Throw them in the back. They sort of fit our requirement. I have one of those pickups with a seat in the back. Cab. <SEP> And so they just fit in there. When they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work. <SEP> Right now I can throw them all in the back when we have room. And since I do a lot of projects I throw things in the back. There you go. And I kind of like having a pickup truck. Yo-. <SEP> Actually I think of it as a car that'll last. I know. I like the way trucks are built. And I don't care about comfort. So I'm pretty happy. You're looking at. I got a Toyota Four Runner. I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too. So I got a Four Runner. <SEP> So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one. I never buy new. So I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck. You're just like me. I've never bought a new vehicle in my life. And. I don't need to pay for the glitz. I'll let somebody else have the showroom shine. <SEP> And I'll pay for the rest of it. Let somebody else break it in. And the van we're sor-. We might go again on a van. We could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time. I'm not sure. <SEP> We'll have to face it in a couple of years. But I guess we had a small Toyota wagon. <SEP> And we were real happy with that because my second requirement after price is low maintenance. And it certainly had that. We didn't do much to it at all. <SEP> My. Pretty much the same. Like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners. And it pretty much does everything I need it to. It'll tow three thousand pounds. So I can tow everything. And it. I can throw. I've had eleven people in it before. Believe it or not. <SEP> And it's real reliable. Belie-. I've had it for almost four years now. And up until two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it. And then of course two weeks ago it decided. <SEP> I don't know. It's the strangest weirdest thing in the world. But it blew a head gasket. Didn't do any damage to it. I caught it real early. <SEP> How. At how many miles? Ninety-seven thousand. <SEP> So it's not real early. You didn't overheat it? Never overheated it. I smelled the coolant. <SEP> Went out and looked. Saw where it was coming from. Drove it right to the shop and left it off. That was. And that was it. Because I have that. And then I have a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is actually usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining. <SEP>. That's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle. <SEP> It's a. I don't know. People who buy motorcycles for transportation are kidding themselves. I have one colleague that commutes to work on one when it's not raining. And he's a. It's. He's pretty conservative guy. I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess. I know. But I bet you he really enjoys riding it. <SEP> I'm sure he does. So yo-. H-. When was the last time you took your truck out just to go driving? <SEP>. And I go out twice a week on the bike. At least. Just for the enjoyment. <SEP>. <SEP> But. The only thing I think I might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but another car. I would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had just an open bed to throw stuff in. I'm sure that that's very. You got one. That's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back. And. <SEP> If I only had some place that I could store the camper top I would have it off most of the time. I really leave it on there just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty. To have it out of the way. <SEP> But they're solid. Trucks are built. I think they last a lot longer than anything else. They're the only things Americans still know how to build. And. The trucks do. Even though the little Jap trucks are good there too. But so are the. Though I think the Chevies. I don't think the Che-. I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords. <SEP> I think the Fords tend to last a little longer. At least until recently. I kind of like mine. <SEP> So mine's a Ford. A friend of mine just bought a year ago. It's a really nice truck. I don't like Dodges at all. But one of the Dodges they have out now has the Cummins turbo diesel on it. I heard about that. It's beautiful. <SEP> That thing will last forever. That's a serious truck. That thing's. It's got a boat engine in it. <SEP> This. I know a contractor who just got one of those. He's pleased with it.
sw4565.txt:I. Actually in this modern day and age it seems like we have more and more leisure time because we have so many appliances and whatnot. We don't even have to cook dinner anymore. But I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together. <SEP> The kids maybe on the average get something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents. That's what I've heard too. It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it although I think probably the worst thing that's happening in at least the modern world today is television. <SEP> Not so much because it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming. And there's also some poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time. It's so darned easy to turn the thing on. <SEP> I know it. I tell myself sometimes just sit down after work. So I refuse to have one in the house. <SEP> Good for you. Good for you. I talk to a lot of people about that. And I've thought about it myself. And I though about it a lot. But I still haven't done it yet. That's good. I'll tell you. Television sure makes child rearing easy on you. The kids can be a real pest. And turning the T V on is almost like magic. It's like sticking an electrode into their pleasure center. And you don't have to worry about them. <SEP> That's true. I've noticed that. But I don't think it's too good. I don't think so either. So I don't know. I take advantage. I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids. But I take advantage of dinner time. We always eat together. And whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them. <SEP> Do you keep your kids active in sports or anything. Or. I guess our big outlet is music. Our thirteen year old son plays violin. And our nine year old daughter plays cello. <SEP> And when our son started playing violin I took up violin. And when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello. <SEP> So there's plenty of interactive time in practicing. Although neither kid likes to practice. I guess that's not a big surprise. <SEP> Not for kids. But I imagine with infants most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them. Although. I try and read to them. <SEP> And I take them to the park and stuff. And. Reading is so good. I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little. And I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore. <SEP> They get to that stage. But I read. There's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book. Have you ever seen that yet? Sleep book. It's called a sleep book. And you ought to get it. I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized. <SEP> We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books. I think his sleep book is my favorite. <SEP>. I like to do it. And they enjoy reading. I never read a lot growing up. And I never read until a few years ago. I just started picking up books. And so I've found that it's really important to me to get to read. I like to get away in a book? <SEP> And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and. So how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day? <SEP> I probably spend an hour or two. That's great. My wife works at night. So she does Tupperware. So she's gone a lot at nights. And so I spend a lot of time with them. I see. <SEP> How old are your kids again? They're two and one. Two and one. <SEP> So you have your hands full with them. That's for sure.
sw4316.txt:Do you think that there's any way that. Or do you think there's too much crime now? I guess any crime is too much. But It's out of control. <SEP> Out of control I don't know. I guess it could be worse. We've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood. I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington. There's a lot of problems. There's a big rise in homelessness and more street people. And we get cars on our block regularly gone through rifled through and stuff. <SEP> I would not have guessed that in Seattle. You figured it was like Omaha? <SEP> You know. It's not Newark. But. It's got problems. I wonder what really is the answer. It seems like the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system. <SEP> I think most people regard it as a warehouse. Where you put away the people that are so bad that you don't want them out in circulation. But the problem is that we only have but so much room. And we try to put aside in the warehouse. And all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes. <SEP> And. That's what I hear. So it's. <SEP> I think. Don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea? I get the feeling that a lot of people have. I'm not convinced that I have. My mom taught English as a second language. And she was dealing mostly with people that were in on drug crimes. And. <SEP> You mean she taught in a prison? In a maximum security prison down in central Virginia. <SEP> I see. And the problem she had was not with the inmates at all. The people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison. <SEP> It was. The bureaucracy. They put her. Obviously I didn't see the classroom and hopefully never will. But they put her at the end of a hallway. <SEP> There were no other classes going on at the time. And they refused to let her wear a body alarm. Which. And. I don't know exactly what that is. But I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and really annoy a lot of people. <SEP> But. So she didn't feel safe. She didn't. She didn't. She felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates. And then later on the administration kept getting worse. And she got a couple of inmates that she didn't feel quite as comfortable around. <SEP> But when we came back to the States she decided that it was too. She didn't feel that public schools were safe. So next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison. But. <SEP> At least it's maximum security. But the point was that it. You said that perhaps people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible. And I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people that run the system have given up on it. I think the people that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical. <SEP> I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff. And it's. You can get pretty hardened I'm sure. But getting. I always have problems because I can never decide whether or not I'm supposed to be a conservative or a liberal. But. But I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that a lot of this is circumstances. <SEP> Those are funny labels. I can't help but wonder if I grew up without a father on the streets and with little or no money wouldn't I be in prison at this point? <SEP> I think you can blame it on social problems. I don't know. <SEP> As poverty has gotten worse as education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's been more crime. We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program. There's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse. <SEP> And. It's a mess. I don't remember the gentleman's name. But the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar. And what he. Is he the guy wants to deregulate heroin or something? What he wants to do is take all the money that he gets for drug enforcement and use it for drug education. <SEP> And basically just attack the problem at the demand side. Stop trying to attack supply which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't. Switzerland tried the grand experiment.

sw4831.txt:When you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times the benefits are good. And the pay is regular. But sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on. And I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know what's going on. And maybe that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do. What's your feeling about benefits? What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company. Since I'm kind of on the older side I just feel like when I start talking about benefits I'm concerned about medical benefits. My husband works for McDonald Douglas. And so his medical benefits are so excellent. That's really great. <SEP> I work for a bank Western Financial. And they don't let me know really about anything that's going on. Even some of the immediate things that I need to know I don't know it until the next hour. And all of a sudden we know we've got changes made. We're changing departments. We're changing policies. We're changing doing other kinds of things. Which to me is disturbing. I feel like if I don't necessarily need to be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level. You are right there. I'm pretty much on a low level as far as the company is concerned. But I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening. And I think I can be a better and more effective employee if I had a little bit more information along that line. Th-. I work for the government. <SEP> And actually I work for the F B I. And so there's lots of things that we don't get told. For good reason. But basically there's lots of things that we should know about projects. I'm an engineer. <SEP> I'm a COTR. And sometim-. And I worked in the same lab with a guy. And we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years. And we should have. We're now collaborating. And. <SEP> And it. For two years we didn't. Which was kind of stupid. But our organization is doing something else on Monday. For all unclassified programs we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways. And all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do. Which I thought was kind of interesting but that sort of thing. That is interesting. <SEP> But I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on. But of course most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know. And if you don't really count. If you're not part of the program you might not get told for months. Or you might if it doesn't impact you directly. Or if your management doesn't think that. But regard to benefits. Most big organizations have decent benefits like retirement and that sort of thing. In the private sector I would think that one of the major situations especially when you reach the mid-fifties is keeping a job until you retire. <SEP> A-. And engineers are baggage as they get older to most companies. And it's very much like the military. It windows out. You think I'm getting more money. And I'm getting more responsibility. I'm doing this. But as you climb up that tree pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree. And pretty soon somebody falls off. I've fallen off twice in the private sector. <SEP> And I can get up. I know. It seems to be kind of scary. Because you think of. My son's eighteen right now. And he wants to go into engineering. And the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open. And he's interested in basically three different areas. But it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that. He needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years. <SEP> And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical. My brother-in-law he's sixty. He's not ready to retire. But his company is closing up. And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff. And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on. He's getting cut back. And he's not ready to retire. He may be retired.
sw4859.txt:. Generally I get most of my news in the weekly magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. With occasional smatterings of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and of course the local paper. But my only complaint is I really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper exhaust the details. So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. <SEP> Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article. And so I like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of what's going on. <SEP> But many times the local news kind of suffers. But here I am cheek by jowl with our nation's capital. And. That's right. You're very close actually. It's almost a bedroom community for the capital. <SEP>. When the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself guys I'm inside the beltway. <SEP> But it turns out that the C N N is great. And for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events. But generally they're more sound bitish kind of thing. And I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient dose of news that way. <SEP> A lot of my information comes from several sources. Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio. Which I like. <SEP> I think it's fairly objective. And I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative. And while there's an inherent filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of favoring the other side. That's potential indication of balance. And generally I really do believe they are pretty balanced. I also read TIME magazine. And we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the articles and the front section. And. The MERCURY and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really can stand up there. <SEP> You st-. Did you use to live around here? Redwood City. I use to work at Anteks. <SEP>. I know exactly where that is. Anteks Amdahl and places like that. We get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper. <SEP> A-. The newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times the LOS ANGELES TIMES. Which I've found to be a very good quality newspaper. And I like a lot of the articles there. The other thing when you said we don't have cable T V but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is called C SPAN. I enjoy. We have both C SPANS here. But really on the public T V MACNEIL LEHRER is an hour's program that I always. <SEP> Both? If I watch any news program it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. And occasionally C SPAN. <SEP> I saw the tapes that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust. The whole thing was run on that. And also they have the PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD. I never say that. That would have been interesting. It. <SEP> I think that's always fascinating. I wish we had something. When it first tuned in on that I. It's one that's. I think it was somebody was just ripping the hell out of another person. And I. And everybody was making noise in the background. And then. <SEP> But it's usually the Prime Minister? Here's this dude in a wig. Thatcher. Major. And I said to myself it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about. <SEP> And then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench. And I said it's Parliament. Which could be another of Monty Python. So I thought to myself I can't wait. I'm going over to Britain in mid-May. I'm going to approach my. This is how I discovered the Prime Minister's question and answer period. P-. <SEP> I have seen that. And aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in American politics which I really enjoy. I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions I think. And it's unlike the fairly controlled press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they always seem.
sw4329.txt:I guess it starts recording now. I don't really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in. We live in the Saginaw area. <SEP> Saginaw? And I'm not real familiar with anything that. I. Fact as far as I know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. Or the grocery store or anything in this area. <SEP> The rec-. We live in Plano. And they started off recycling by putting the. I think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now. I guess the city has bought the big green trash cans. And they have a recycling truck that comes around now. And you separate your glass and paper and aluminum. And you set it out. And they pick it up. And it works real neat. They seem to be having a real good response. <SEP> That is pretty good. We're originally from another state. And I know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing. The city set separate trash cans. And you separated your stuff. And you put it in there. And they took it. On bottles did they give you so many cents back for cans. I don't really know. <SEP> Even or. I don't really know. They started after we moved down here. And so I'm not really familiar. I just know that my in-laws up in Oklahoma that's how they pick it up. But I don't know if they get anything back on it. Or do you get money for it? <SEP> I noticed it. Iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can. So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles. <SEP> All kinds of bottles they really charge people when you purchase them and then when you turn them back in. <SEP> I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel. And now most of them are throwaway. <SEP> So maybe that's one thing they can do. I think now they're a lot more expensive than that. I bought some Cokes the other day in the little bottles. And I know they were at least ten cents apiece. I started to see at home. I was how much were those bottles? <SEP> And they come in eight and ten packs instead of six packs. And it was two dollars and something for the bottles. I was God Almighty. It costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes. <SEP> That was my brother's first job in a grocery store. He was in the bottle area. In the bot-. It's pretty dangerous out there when they fall over. But it's quite. <SEP> They say that there's a big glut of the green glass. Of green glass. <SEP> It's amazing. Out in this area they really don't have anything. I know that Minyard's and places like that around Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have four different bins out front. Different colors for different things and things like that. <SEP> But I do know some of these places were doing that. And they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them. <SEP> It's. I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs. It's. People just. They really don't. There's too much labor involved to separate the stuff. More than it's worth. <SEP> It's. I don't know. It can be. It's not as easy selecting clean junk as they say. Who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away. <SEP> That's right. That's right. It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. We all do it. <SEP> It was nice talking to you. It was nice talking to you. I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything. I think two or three minutes is fine. I-. <SEP> Is that it? It was nice talking to you. And I guess actually I was going to do it for my son so that he could make some money. <SEP> But then it has my name on it. So I'm okay. I'll sit down here and call it. We're doing it for a church choir. So. Are you? <SEP> That's interesting. That's nice. <SEP> Thank you. Thank you.
sw4358.txt:. What is your community currently doing with regard to recycling? Basically they're just having various recycling bins located for trash pickup. That's more than we have up here in Massachusetts. Some local communities are very active in that respect. And they do have bins set up. But I live in a metropolitan area. And they're not too inclined to do something as aggressive as that. <SEP> Here they. Live in an apartment complex. And they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins. I think a lot of the issues with regard to recycling are that people have to be motivated to do something like that because it does take extra effort. Whether. And I know Massachusetts has. A bottle bill was passed. And we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now. And the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the store and not. That's the majority of people that I know of anyways. Where people aren't really eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do. And I'm not going to throw a bottle away. It's like throwing a nickel away. That type of thing. <SEP> Here they're trying to push through a bill. But people need to be more conscious of it. And a lot of people are against it. And it's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell sodas and stuff. Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything. It took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. And matter of fact I think it took three tries for it to go through. And it's been pretty successful. And people notice it as far as highways being. People would have a drink of soda. Instead of throwing out the window they keep the bottle. So it's been a ecologically sound policy as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth. But more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into manufacturing. And that's the big thing that they try to promote. <SEP> I think here instead of just requiring that you put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate. That's a good idea. <SEP> There definitely has to be a motivation factor. And I know that where I work. I work for a defense contractor. And there's a big push on for recycling paper materials computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of Styrofoam usage because of the process involved in Styrofoam and the whole eco issue and that. And they're very proactive. And matter of fact they give you discounts if you use china wear rather than Styrofoam stuff. So it's incentives like that that get people more conscious of it. I think that's what they need to do. Be more proactive like that. I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books. Usually have them come from projects to collect old ones. Usually just get dumped out with the trash. And phone books are a large volume of annual trash. They just. Matter of fact that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa-. The local schools you could send your phone book with your kid to school. And what they'll do is they'll recycle it. Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time. A guy went to a landfill dug down five feet and pulled up a phone book from nineteen sixty. Because they don't degrade over such a period of time. <SEP> Part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper. They contain the glue and stuff. And they used to have to take out all the pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them. <SEP> Now I think they've come up with some way of pulling the glue out.
sw4796.txt:Randall. Do you have any special interest in space flight? Ever since I was a young and used to watch the old Apollo missions going off in classroom T V -s. <SEP> I suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those go off. Very exciting. <SEP> The. I've always wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that. And to meet and to see it actually happen. Of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday. <SEP> But that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately. What do you do now? Computer programmer. <SEP> Unfortunately that can be done from the ground. To bad. Made the wrong career choice to get up into space. <SEP> The. I used to think when I was younger that by this time we'd have lots more stuff in space than we do now. Frustrating at times. <SEP> I don't know what you think about all that. I'm kind of young. I'm only twenty-two. And so I'm not. There's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as with the space shuttle and all. Although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties. Although I have a. I kind of wonder if it were possible to market some form of space technology to make it equitable it might severely help the economy in the respect that there's endless amounts of research to be done. Endless amounts of resources and whatnot. <SEP> It would be great if we could find some way to use that to boost the economy. <SEP> The. I've always felt that one of the long-term solutions would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up. Because that's a singularly renewable resource that doesn't require any particularly nasty environment impact. <SEP> And you can just get as much power as you need up there. It's just a matter of how big you build it. <SEP> And of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing. So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good very very good for everyone in the long run is some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also. So I'm. It seems like there's. So you're talking about positive side effects then. I understand. <SEP>. That makes a lot of sense. The only problem is of course that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there. <SEP> And they want to do the research. And they're all nor-. <SEP> The only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to Mars. Which would produce some useful scientific research and so forth. But the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth. <SEP> It would be being done for the glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of for. We should eventually send people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so. <SEP> We should do it for the return we get for it. And unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened. Least not. <SEP> I would settle for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the. But. The downside of that is after you do one of those people say we did it. <SEP> Now we're done. Now we're done. <SEP> No need to play around with this space stuff anymore. That's what happened with Apollo. But I'd give almost anything to get into space. I think you're right. I would too. I'd. Was it John Denver that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle?
sw4628.txt:What sort of company do you work for? Do you work for a big or a little place? I work for Georgia Tech. Sir. I work for the research facility. And it's kind of small in a sense. But it does have about two thousand civil employees. <SEP> And on a scale I guess it's still considered small. It just have a lot of different laboratories. The area I work in it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so. <SEP> So that's make up most of the laboratory. So from that standpoint it's pretty small. What about yourself? I work for actually probably similar kind of place. I work for Lincoln Laboratory. <SEP>. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech. I see. And. So we're actually part of M I T. So it's very much the same kind of place the technical institution. <SEP>. While I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what things were important besides salary and a job. List I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the challenge of the work and the working conditions things like that. <SEP>. I don't know. What sorts of things would you consider important? <SEP> Those and probably the security aspect of it. Because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working you're treated. And it may not be true in every place. In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a person. <SEP> Because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and their well being as far as how their next dollar going to come in. How they going to pay their bills. They just lay them off. And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had. I think the company still exists. What they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off. <SEP> That way that one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time. And I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better other than something like. Unemployment is good. But the company as a whole. Because you as an employee even the company is making money. They paying you a salary. But you are responsible for that company growth. You're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits. So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than neglect or something like that. <SEP> Because it's not a person's fault that people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time. I don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but a number of people can be the downfall of a company situation. How do you mean that? I know it. In a sense that how do you make a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. For the bad times of the company. <SEP> What about the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well. In that standpoint. You think it's better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company. Or. <SEP> I do. I really do. I think it'd be better that way. And even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that there are problems. <SEP> And there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time. <SEP> That's my views. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. I think back about a few years ago when things were tough Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. They went to a four and a half day work week rather than just cut everybody back ten percent. And have to give everybody a half day a week off. <SEP>. And I think you can do that for a little while. But I'm. <SEP> At least that would give a person a chance to look. Because the way it is a person really don't have a chance.
sw4311.txt:Go ahead. The subject is child care and how to determine child care. And that's an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children. But I did run a child care facility for a while. <SEP> And have some. You should have some opinions on that then. I do have some thoughts on that. It's an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent or parent for a lot of people there. And it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities. I guess if I were going to choose my first consideration would be safety. <SEP> My second consideration would be health. And I guess my third consideration would be warm personal environment. <SEP> <SEP> In Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate at an institutional level and at a small home level. So you meet the standards. But then after that there's a lot more. I think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people in terms of not just. Because somebody has a child or likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that. Absolutely. As a matter of fact I believe that the safety and health issues depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children. <SEP> And that was the most difficult thing of all to find the right people the qualified people. And it's the most difficult of all for a parent judge because a person can be very nice and warm and loving. But if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are. <SEP> And the other thing that's difficult in a too small setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't want to just warehouse the child. And I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important. And you have to have the right kind of enrichment. And that includes an atmosphere in which the child is safe and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for. But also his developmental needs are cared for too. Maybe the right thing to do is to when a couple has a child then they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting. That would be lovely. Get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six. <SEP> And then of course to make up for that the parents would have to work in their later years longer. In other words they probably may end up not working at all in the twenties. That's an interesting thought because. But then they have to work from age thirty or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety. <SEP> That would be okay. That would help on the other end too in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be. The world is changing from industrial base to information base. And so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work. <SEP> That's exactly right. All you have to do is have a sharp mind. And I believe that mental acuity is easy to maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind. <SEP> So I think a person could work into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter. If they didn't have to do a lot of physical labor they could maintain.
sw4801.txt:What do you think about capital punishment? I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes. Which crimes do you feel that? <SEP> I think first degree murder probably warrants it. Because of. So many times it's so brutal and just recurrent. Selling should also. <SEP> Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever. I originally come from the state that has the death penalty. I come from Florida. <SEP> And they're pretty liberal on it. They tend to fry people left and right. Which. That's. Go ahead. Go ahead. Texas is too. Texas has had forty-six in the past several years. <SEP> So they're pretty hip on it too I guess. They do it by lethal injection at Huntsville. I think Florida still uses electric chair. <SEP> I don't know. In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God. And that's not. I don't think that's right. But on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it. <SEP> I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it. And of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. With Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year. They. That's what's happening here. There is. That's. In fact a big gubernatorial issue is the turnover rates of repeat offenders being let out and doing it again. <SEP>. And it's like that's a big problem. But there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build. <SEP> And it gets to be a big problem. Go ahead. I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't. <SEP> Be a little more. Not being able to put it off for fifteen years. Because a lot of these guys they get in. And they get off for good behavior. And I don't know. Up in Minnesota where I am now they don't have the death penalty. And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system. Because they figure I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something. But then for. If I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten. <SEP>. Just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early. <SEP> But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head. I don't know. I think that may solve a lot of that. <SEP> Maybe not solve it. But I don't know. Maybe. I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient. Kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty. <SEP> What do you do Georgeanne? I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas. What program you in? Audiology. <SEP>. What do you do? I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida. <SEP> I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell. <SEP> But I don't know. It's an interesting issue. Like you say in Texas there's been quite a few. And in Florida in the last few years I think there's been a lot. I can't give you figures. But. I just. This was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California. So I think it. The forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years is what. <SEP> Is that right? They gave a run down that Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then. <SEP> I've heard things about that. I've heard that they don't mess around very much. They don't get repealed as easily as they do. <SEP> The guy in California got thir- twice before he went to the gas chamber. And then they said. You don't have to go. And then they took him back. It just seemed a little inconsistent. That's a lot of repeals. And then you have two. You have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever. <SEP>. I don't know. I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it. I guess. What's the policy now with treason? Do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? I don't think the military doesn't execute anymore. So. <SEP> Or death before the firing squad or whatever. So I think about the only one is rape.
sw4363.txt:What's your. Are you into the Cowboys? <SEP> I'm not. I haven't been. I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a Cowboys' man. I like Philadelphia Eagles. <SEP> That's all right. That's my favorite team. So. <SEP> Now that Randall's coming back next season I hope they'll do a little bit better. They didn't do too bad last season. But I hope they can do better. How about yourself? I don't know. I kind of go back and forth depending on who's really hot and who's not. I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects. <SEP> But I guess if I have my druthers I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks. Tha-. I kind of like them. <SEP> That's another one of my favorites. They're kind of. They're not my favorite totally. But I do like them. I like. Yo-. <SEP> Seahawks are good. They. Now that Steve Largent is gone I kind of lose a little bit for them. But he. To be honest with you I probably watch college a little bit more than I do pro. <SEP>. I kind of like college actually. Quite a bit. <SEP> That's kind of strange. It's too much running for me in college football. I like the pros. Is it? They do. It's more high tech. More players are apt to act a little bit different when it's a job and not just. That could be. <SEP> When you're getting paid millions to do it I think they take it to another level. But I can see it's more grunted out run the ball type. College football is a little bit different. But. You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then. <SEP> Who's that? Notre Dame? I root for Nebraska quite a bit. <SEP> Nebraska. There's a running team. Ye-. That's boring for me. I'll take the passing teams any day. <SEP> But. I can see definitely how you get into that. To be honest with you I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well. And. It's four yards three yards eight yards tackle. <SEP> It gets kind of monotonous. After awhile I prefer a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just to juice it up a little bit. But. I think they're starting to realize that. A lot of the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore. <SEP> It's high dollar. It's all money now. Even college is all can we get on T V. So. <SEP> That's. So what's d-. This World League is coming in? That's getting ready to start up? Have you followed that very much. Or. <SEP> Not really. I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L. I think it's an institution. It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball. I just. <SEP> It can take over part of it. But it's never going to be the next. It can take over a small market share. But nothing really. It's going to take a little bit. Some people are going to watch it. But it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything. <SEP> It's never going to reach that standard. But. I think I agree with you. It's kind of interesting to see their claim of world football. But when in reality it's really Americans playing somewhere else. It's kind of strange. I guess we're the only ones who take it that far. <SEP> Everybody else still nuts over soccer. But. Actually I kind of like soccer. I've never really played it. But I like the idea. It's an interesting game to watch. That and rugby. I like to watch rugby every now and then. <SEP> Or Australian rules football. That's. Whatever you want to call it there. <SEP> That's some brutal stuff there. That's worse than football as far as violence I think. Those guys kill each other out there. Rugby is something else. There's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere. That's just wild. That's why it's a big college thing. <SEP> Rugby is definitely big in college. Because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do. Tha-. So. I could see the feel for that. But it's fun to play. <SEP> I'll give it that. It is fun to play. If you don't value your very much. You've played it then? But I don't think rugby will ever be professional. But it's. I doubt it. Not in this country anyway. <SEP> You can't stay healthy and do that. That's a rough game. It is. <SEP> But I don't know. I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this year. So you. The Seahawks are an up and down kind of team. They really are. <SEP> It's kind of odd. My roommate that I live with here he's lived in Pennock Minnesota. Do you know where that is? I don't. To tell you the truth I'm. It's a small town. It's about two hours. It's in central Minnesota. It's a couple of hours west of Minneapolis. <SEP> But. To tell you the truth I'm not even really from here. You just live there now. I'm up here for a year on an internship. <SEP> He's. But I actually live in Florida. Live in Florida. <SEP> Like the Seahawks. Who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay? I've only been to Philadelphia twice. <SEP> And I still like. I guess I could go for Miami. But I don't know. <SEP> But. I'm from. I root for Nebraska. So I don't have a real love for Miami anyway. But I don't know. I guess I get into pretty much.
sw4826.txt:I'm here. How do you feel about public schools? Our public schools are really poor I feel. <SEP> I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation. But we're toward the bottom. And there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct. <SEP> But the system doesn't allow for the corrections. <SEP> How about you? That's interesting. I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw Georgia. And she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there. And she complained quite a bit about their school system there. <SEP> And. And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in. <SEP> She was in Cobb County. I'm. I can't really say much about the schools up here. I really don't come from here. I'm only up here temporarily on an internship. But I live in Orlando Florida usually. <SEP> And the schools down there are not bad. They're pretty good. That's great. But I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good. <SEP> For example I have a brother in North Carolina. And he says the schools there are. Just terrible. I feel that we're way behind. I have a son that is in the fourth grade. <SEP> And they have just now taken up division. And. That is slow. <SEP> I-. E-. My husband and I go to the store. And we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things. And I feel like there are several areas that we're just really really slow in. And I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system. It is. What do you think's wrong to cause that? <SEP> For one thing there's not enough money in the school system. And the money they do have they do not use it wisely. My son's teacher has twenty-seven students. <SEP> And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis. <SEP> But more than that I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children. And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It can really be bad. <SEP> That's one thing I worry about. Also I think we have a lot of Hispanics. There you go. <SEP> And we have a lot of. The county I'm in the minorities are mostly Hispanic. Probably quite a few black people up there. And. We're from the county they marched in. We're in Forsyth county. Is that right? <SEP> And we. And there's very very few blacks. So that's. I hate to say. It's not a problem because I hate to feel like they are a problem although they are. But it's. You don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever. But then again. <SEP> But it is a problem. Especially in the inner city. There is no denying that. You have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school. <SEP> And you can't put all the children in special education. That's right. You can't do that. And if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done. <SEP> I grew up in Nebraska. And the school that I went to there was fantastic. It. I really consider myself very very lucky. We had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty-seven thirty kids to a class. <SEP> But. But your teacher had control. We zipped right along. I was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily. <SEP>. I believe I was too. <SEP> But you're right. With all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline I think. <SEP> It really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school. We just can not afford it. I was going to ask you if that was an option. <SEP> If.
sw4382.txt:. Here in Logan Utah we've got a nice little valley here. And it's crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in. And then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley. Here in Seattle the air's getting more and more polluted. We're in kind of a basin. And Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains. And there's been a lot of population growth around here. And it's getting worse. I think most of it is from cars. <SEP>. Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo. And Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north. We get a lot of pollution. And it's like seventy percent of it is from cars. <SEP> And it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion. And when we get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above. And it just sits and sits and sits. And we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago. <SEP> It's almost sad. Because when I grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys. And now it's not in the mountain valleys. I live in the university district. And it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution. I think probably due to a lot of students going back and forth to school. <SEP> And then we're right next to Interstate Five also. They're getting serious about things like mandatory. They've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties. Emissions. Have they started doing that yet? <SEP> They've actually started doing it down along the. Not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better. Population is a lot lighter up here. We have that here. And they're expanding it to more counties here. As the population spreads out. And I think they're also going to be making it mandatory for more cars. There was something in the law about if your car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore. And I think they're eliminating that loophole. <SEP> They're eliminating that out here. They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun. Where they're looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust. Kind of like a radar gun. And. You mean they could do that remotely? <SEP>. Do it remotely just looking at the what they do. They do several different types of things. Sometimes they put a source light. And they look at the source light. And then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it. And you can look at the emissions actually. <SEP> And. Where does the source light go? Across the street. They'll set up a trap or something like that in some sense. I see. <SEP> And they're also looking at other ways of monitoring this cause they've found out something basically that. And a poorly tuned car can emit something. It's an incredible amount. It was four hundred times as much of certain pollutants then a properly tuned car. And the idea being that if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing fifty percent of the pollution then it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half. That's neat. <SEP> But it's also been. Everybody is talking about using more mass transient here. But it's tough. I've looked into riding the bus to work. And I can drive to work and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges. But if I take the bus it requires several transfers. And it takes over an hour. <SEP> So it's not hard to see why I keep driving. And they're. And I feel guilty cause I'm driving a.
sw4353.txt:. Do you all have a budget? We do. We've been married for twenty-three years. <SEP> And we have three teenage daughters. And they're very expensive. So we have somewhat of a system. It's kind of hard to explain. We've actually gone just recently to having two checking accounts. We always had just one. <SEP> And now we are having two. It's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal. It's. So I have to be. That's kind of the way I feel about it. <SEP> I usually. My wife handles a lot of the day to day finances. And of course we're like a lot of people. We just scramble through month to month. And. Do you have a two income family or one income? <SEP> We have a two income family. She also works. <SEP> But she enjoys it. And she's good at it. If it's. I'm pretty bad about procrastinating. And one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe. <SEP> You know how that goes. But if she handles it pretty well. She writes all the checks once a month. Your wife. It. That. What. Is her career related to finance or accounting? <SEP> Sort of on a peripheral. She's an annuity administrator. And so she works for an insurance company. <SEP> But she enjoys it. She likes keeping track of all that stuff. And. So that's sort of related to her field a little bit. Sort of. <SEP> And we've experimented with budgets from time to time. But if. You have to keep up with them. So a lot of times we just kind of play it by ear. We try to keep our retirement and our savings kind of automated. So we never see that money. Just taken directly. It's just taking it out. <SEP>. We do the same thing. And that's kind of handy. Because if you don't see it you don't miss it. If. <SEP> You don't spend it. You have something to take it out. That's exactly what we've always done. They've always had where they match your funds. Sometimes if you save so much then they will match it. <SEP> We've done that too. But my husband works for an insurance company. And he has now for about ten years. But he was with another company before that. But we have. I work also. But I only have a part time job. <SEP> And I get paid very little. But I try to use that money for food mo-. Jim gives me a certain amount money. We just transfer it into my account. And then I use that for food household expenses. And then I add my own check to that. And then with that I try and handle some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that. <SEP> But the expenses that we need and have around the house. It sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do. <SEP> Just kind of play it by ear but keep the deductions. We. <SEP> Jim has a budget. I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down. I am given so much money a month. So I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that. <SEP> So I try not to. I don't ask for more. I just try and make it on that. Because I think when you go to the grocery store you can go crazy with all the choices that you have. <SEP>. And you can really waste a lot of money that way. <SEP> How long have you been married? About five years. So you're just really getting started. <SEP> So do you have a family too? I've got one little girl. She's nineteen months. <SEP> She's not. She hasn't effected your budget yet really. Not really. Not too bad. Not like she will later on. <SEP> You will see that all of a sudden you're trying to decide whether you are going to do soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do. When. <SEP> And then you really have to start saying now what can we afford. What can we do here. And then you have to really sit down and plan some more. But I think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget. <SEP> And then as the girls got older I think we did more and more of that. More budgeting as they got older. But what do you do? Do you. <SEP> I'm an electronic technician. I work for a university. Georgia Tech research. <SEP> And. So I just. We have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta. I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things. I'd better get back to the subject. <SEP> But budgeting. I found I feel a lot better. We use to work out of one check book. And it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month. <SEP> Now I know exactly what I'm spending. And it's so much easier.
sw4378.txt:One way or another we're now recording. Home repair. <SEP> You were helping your parents. I still am really. They're sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta in Candler Park. And we've done lots to it. We've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them. And. <SEP> You're remodeling? How about you? <SEP> I live in an apartment now. Two summers ago I went to Massachusetts. And I went with a friend of mine. And we undertook a building house. <SEP> And this was a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions. And it's preconstructed you might say. And we started from an empty lot with trees and stuff on it. <SEP> And we had to cut them down and clear the lot. We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. Pour the basement and went from the ground up. One of our main problems was. <SEP> In Massachusetts I thought I was going to. It was a fun time. But I thought summer time. All it ever did was rain and thunder storms. <SEP> And one thing is that we were going to pour the basement foundation. And we're in the process. And it started pouring down rain. <SEP> And I guess we had most of it done. But the end was result. What happened was that a lot of water settled on the top. And it really didn't give a very good finish. And some of the. It was sort of sandy and not a very good finish. <SEP> But it was okay. And it's only the basement floor. So it was okay. But it kept us pretty busy. It was only. There was me and my friend. And then we just had two helpers and sort of a family type. <SEP> It wasn't a commercial project or something. It was sort of just get my brother and maybe my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes. <SEP> And then materials coming in. And so we're hopping around pretty good. But overall we got it done. And it's a three bedroom two bath house. And it's pretty neat. Nice. <SEP>. Nice. What was it for? You just. It was for my friend's parents. They had some property there. And they'd lived in this old. <SEP> It's sort of like a farm you might say. And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something. And his mom just wanted a new house. <SEP> That has been her dream. And so we did that. And she was really pleased with it. So it came really great. That's great. <SEP> Why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot. Where you live it gets very hot? It does. <SEP> And that's why you. And the windows what type of windows are you putting in? Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in the solar game? <SEP> Have you. What are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or. We just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass. My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it. But it. In a lot of the windows? <SEP> The house is eighty years old. And it's had several owners and stuff. And they have put plastic Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows. <SEP> These. So you have the sash windows in? Did it go up and down? <SEP> I see. And so we wanted to get all new stuff in there. <SEP> There's a problem with those. Those are. They usually most of the time don't open very well. Ours didn't. And the ones that would open wouldn't want to stay open. They wanted to slam shut. <SEP>. And they. A lot of vibration. And it causes the glass to crack. And it's a never ending problem. <SEP>. I haven't been in any really home repair things lately. I.
sw4725.txt:Regarding taxes. I. Taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society. But really people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself. And so as a result it's a trade-off for the common good. For the benefit of others. How much of your resource should you dedicate to making things work for others? Have you ever thought just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it? <SEP> I know it's a lot that I feel just like you said that there's just so much that you can do yourself. That you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for. But they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either. But yet they accept it. The thing of it is if I wanted to just permanently become a book reader I guess I could just go on public assistance look for people to take care of me. <SEP> Like so many people do. And probably a good woman. <SEP> Just con somebody to take care of me. And then you don't have to be on the tax roll. But taxes are very difficult kind of thing. And everybody really hates it. It was very timely. I always over pay my deductions. So I wind up getting money back from my withholding. <SEP> That's always a smile. But of course I've paid it in. And I should calculate it better. <SEP> You are you in business for yourself? I work for the F B I. <SEP> So I'm a federal employee. Guess I don't sound like it? <SEP> I th-. I think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else. Unless you work for Internal Revenue. I belong. I've got all four feet in the trough being a federal employee. <SEP> But I can understand who gets benefits. Every time there is a bond issue I vote no on every one of them. <SEP> I. But. This is not tax revolt country. There's too many. Most of us have all four feet in the trough. Plus our snout right up to our ears. So it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a tax revolt situation. <SEP> But the local taxes here. In this particular area I think I pay about thirty-five hundred for taxes on my four bedroom house. Which is a lot of money. And so as people get older and older they think about retirement and that sort of thing. <SEP> And they're building old people's homes at tax expense. I think the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper. At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes. I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a house for that? That's right. Instead it's the taxes here. So. <SEP> Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not or Seguin or someplace like that. <SEP> But there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer. And I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer. If you're not going to use them then you want to be in environment. That's a strategy that the people have to take. Is how to be able to lessen their cost of living. I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire. And I'm saying I really can't stay here as a retiree. After you retire. It's too expensive. <SEP> I'm going to have go out in East Fork someplace. And do my thing. <SEP> My parents are in the same situation. Their home is paid for. But still their taxes are so high that my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes. And they have no children in school or anything now. They don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards. They redecorated in nineteen seventy-five. And they're not doing it again. <SEP> So. It's certainly. You must be a T I employee. You must be what? You must be a T I employee? <SEP> I'm not. You're not a T I. Who do you work for? I don't work. I'm a student. I go to school. I'm in nursing school. You're.
sw4697.txt:The question was talking about the juries. And one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having especially for repeat offenders that. Maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again. So that a judge would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed. <SEP> <SEP> I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case. So a judge should have the whole dossier of the criminal there. <SEP> And if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing. I agree with you. One thing I heard was this where instead of going to the regular court they have a mock court. It's supposed to be all legal and everything. You go. And you present your case. The other side presents their case. And you're done with it. It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. But it's not that we have such. It didn't backlog all of the cases that are all ready pending. So I. That was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. <SEP> In other words not. There would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? <SEP> I don't. There's a point on which we don't agree. I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime one of the parties wants one. <SEP> And usually it is the defendant that wants to have the jury hear the case. So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we take that. <SEP> That would require a change in the Bill of Rights I believe. And so. And I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that. Because if I didn't have that right not to have a jury that I would feel that my civil rights had been violated. But I meant for some when both parties agreed that we're going to have a judge here. We're not going to have a jury. Let's get it over with. Sort of car accidents. <SEP> I think that's all ready possible. I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial <SEP> <SEP> So. I agree that that should be encouraged. People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial. But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to clients unless they feel they can tweak a jury into giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the award. Giving a different sentence. <SEP> The take. <SEP> And I suspect it in cases like. I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil. Is that right? We're at liberty to talk and meander as long as it's all on the same theme. <SEP> In the case of civil things maybe the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage. <SEP> And I think that may be where jury use is overdone. There are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently. <SEP>. <SEP> But the lawyers are really. It's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible. <SEP> So. I was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in a criminal cases. <SEP> I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that. But I am in favor of it for criminal cases. So there's a difference of my view there for those two. You can tell I haven't been in too many judges chambers or anything like that. Have you ever had to serve jury duty? N-. I was called once when I was nineteen. <SEP> But I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me. And I was doing school and things like. They let me out. An- I've never had to it since. And that was almost twenty years ago. <SEP> It isn't. Sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in. That would have been about twenty years too. <SEP> Just last year. And the case I heard was a criminal case. And it seemed really trivial. It involved two bicycles. <SEP> We didn't do the sentencing. The judge did. How interesting. <SEP> We rendered a verdict. And then the judge was the one to do the sentencing. And that was here in Wisconsin. So I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it.
sw4334.txt:Type of music is hot down in Texas? I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas. I know what's hot down here with me. So that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know. I don't ever listen to the radio. And that's usually what's hot around here. What kind of music do you like? <SEP> Mostly folk music. Folk music. I find myself listening to a lot of either old timer or New England dance bands as well as just more popular folk music and new artists coming up. <SEP> We're on totally different wavelengths. I'm more old rock and roll some newer heavy metal rock and roll type Van Halen that kind of thing. <SEP> What about classic rock type stations. I don't listen to the radio at all. We live in a fairly small town. So classic rock for me is what I have which is Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix. <SEP> Some of the older Eagles stuff was good. <SEP> I didn't like. They started getting a little more. The type of music at least to me only sounds good at a high volumes. And I don't like listening at high volumes. But some of their older stuff was quite enjoyable to me. <SEP> They. Hotel California and that era. That's something doesn't even sound good loud really. <SEP> Definitely. Anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some I might know of. I don't know any folk music at all. Down in Texas listen to a little country every now and then. Here. I'm sure there's a lot of that down there. <SEP> Plenty. Way more than I can stand down here. I don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it. I. There's a Conway Twitty twang. Then there's the Dolly Parton Hollywood sound. <SEP> That's even more commercialized country music. But it's getting pretty big everywhere as I see it. Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses. I think some of them the artists are even hitting the pop charts. <SEP> It's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is. Concert tours for country and western sings it's quite odd. But I don't know. Music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays I think. It's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music. I think most artists are in to make a few bucks. And that's all it. But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do-. <SEP> Late sixties early seventies they were definitely pushing a message. That's what it. <SEP> That's what you say. And then music is wrapped around now. Now it's the other way around. I don't think Gun. At least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much to say. They don't have anything really important you want to hear. But it's kind of odd. It's like it doesn't have to be good. It's just who does it. <SEP> You hear a Paula Abdul song. And you. And I think if somebody else were to play that everybody would think that's lousy. But because she did it it's supposed to be good. It comes to the point where it's your name not what you do more than anything. Madonna can do anything. And it would be considered good because it's Madonna. <SEP> Madonna could start playing folk music. And folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it. So it's really backwards how things are working now. But. It's the artist not the merit. <SEP> I don't think that's a good thing at all. But that's the point we've reached. So I don't know how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least. I don't know. I know for myself that for the most part I don't know which artist is which. So I listen to a song. I either like the song. Or I don't like it. <SEP> And then if I really like the song eventually I'll figure out who it was. That's about how I am on popular music. I don't know enough about it because I just listen. Everything I listen to is what I buy not whatever they play on the radio. So. You have to figure out what to buy. Or do you just buy along the same artist? <SEP> I. I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time. I don't really switch around to new things very often. It's way to hectic and too confusing. So you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop? <SEP> Generally. Or about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard. And I listen to it that way. But as far as. I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it. That's one thing I like about some of the folk music scenes. There's a couple of nice small coffee houses up in New Jersey. <SEP> And it's very nice. You go into the coffee house. And an artist is there. And very often the artist will have an album. And so if you like the artist you buy the album. So you definitely get to try before you buy. <SEP> That's definitely. I. It. You don't always quite get it right.
sw4868.txt:Budgeting activity in our household is kind of an informal kind of situation. We put. Actually what happens is my check gets automatically deposited. I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore. It just gets deposited. And my wife looks at all those bills that come in. And all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. And so our budgeting. We really don't have a formal budgeting situation. Every time I've ever tried one I've just got wrapped in my inertia. And I've just decided not to pursue it. What's your budget situation? <SEP> Actually I've had a couple of different situations. My current one has been the most successful. At a certain point in life. An- my ex-husband was an alcoholic. And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies. And that left me with three teenagers. Actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it? It certainly is. <SEP> But at any rate what happened was that I just absolutely put away all the credit cards. I didn't rip them up. I didn't send them back. Nothing. I just put them away. Because there was one that it was really handy to have. If I absolutely had to have something I could go use it. But mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had. And if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it. But then as things improved. Once I got them all through college it came to the point where. My parents came through the depression. I'm not sure how old you are. My parents too. You were born in the late thirties or early forties. <SEP> But my. Late thirties. <SEP> And my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house. And that's kind of the way I was raised. And so I'm not a very demanding person in that aspect. For quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money. Now meanwhile I had a building bank balance. And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there. And not ever have to spend any money on interest. <SEP> That's good. And that's the way I've operated ever since then. It. And if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it. We buy what. We just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher. <SEP> And we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars. And. <SEP>. We got a monster bill coming in. But we also have zero interest being paid. And we pay it off as it goes. And that's the way I do my credit cards now. So we never really get that much over extended. <SEP> I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards. But it's the fact that I have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full. We're doing that. We have. This is our big. We did redecorating. Two new pieces in the family room and new carpet. We've just been spending spending spending. <SEP> I'm envious. I. But we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year. <SEP> We don't have that. It's time for you to do these things then? It's about time that we did that. But the terrible part about it. I've looked at it all. And it all looks still pretty good to me. Why we need to replace it? <SEP> But unfortunately my wife really feels as though it's just been an inappropriate thing to. That rug is thirteen years old. Why not replace it. I say it might go for another thirteen. But too late we'll never find that out. This is so funny. That's wonderful. But you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it. And. <SEP> Certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not. I don't spend that much money. We just sort of have had too many obligations to. We sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school. And that was the major decade of expenses. So we feel as. But as far as any formal budgeting we just apparently have been very fortunate. When we want to go out to eat we go out to eat. We never really have to program money for that or make choices. But we don't have that uproarious a lifestyle. After all we're.
sw4736.txt:Capital punishment out in California has had a lot of discourse in the paper. Apparently they haven't executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe. That's as far back as I can remember. That's before my time actually. They. <SEP> We lived in Redwood City when we were out there. And we found that it was a very liberal kind of community. But I really feel that the law enforcement community puts these people behind bars. And then these lawyer groups get together. And they extend beyond the normal appeal process. And just drag his ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years. And I think that there's something that has to be changed in the system to do that. I think capital punishment was probably stringent enough. But I think the appeal process is really getting in the way. <SEP> Do you feel as though there should be more transgressions that would be enforceable by capital punishment? I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not. It's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself. It's at that point where they're saying here you're going on death row. But you'll stay there for twenty years. <SEP> And nothing is being done about it. The laws exist and are frequently upheld in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find. And it's really getting out of hand in many states. The term technicality. The law enforcement community has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous acts are done to get somebody into a situation where they're going to be guilty of a crime. <SEP> And whether the rights of that individual have been impuned. Or whether a policeman has just made a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it. But the merits of the case in terms of the guy was a law breaker as being supportive. I'm at this juncture. I'm not sure what constitutes a technicality. That's what all these hearings are about. And that's what all these court cases are about. Our glorious mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of the can. And he tried to appeal his conviction. And it didn't work. But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry. In the old days and round about times of battle of Hastings the villages if you were a transgressor they either drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody. And you were his slave. And if he didn't like what you did he killed you. <SEP> And that's pretty effective. It's not good for civil rights I guess. But it's pretty effective in that you've got to get along in the community. And if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods. As man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions especially murder cases and that sort of thing. It seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished. And the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off. For instance there's a case a few years back where someone who was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that. The arresting officer did not read the defendant their rights. <SEP> And where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet.
sw4572.txt:So what things do you consider an invasion of privacy? I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. I had a little bit more time to think about it. I was thinking of. I don't know. I started to think about all the big data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those demographics studies that they do that have who knows how much stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere. <SEP> And I don't know. I don't know what they actually have in there. But I know they sell those. <SEP> What about required drug testing as a condition of employment? That was the other one I was thinking of. I think that's. I know drugs are illegal. It thing actually. I have worked at Texas Instruments. <SEP> And they instituted a. Drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees. And actually to tell you the truth I really did not think much about it. I hadn't. It really didn't relate to me. But there were some things that people brought up like what happens if they get a false positive what recourse do you have. <SEP> And also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity. And yet a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they don't admit to it actually a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure. So what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this. Although they don't actually execute it themselves it's really the government that. So in that sense at least philosophically it's really borderline legal. I think that a person's competence should be more determined by their actions and their behavior. And if they're on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them. I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a chemical. <SEP> What about this AIDS epidemic? Where you find that certain people actually are criminal in their disregard for others. These people that are carriers and that don't reveal it? And of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't. <SEP> It destroys their libido. That would be kind of an extreme. <SEP> If they ever. I've heard of things like marking them somehow or something like that or putting them all someplace in a kind of. So what about that as an invasion of privacy? Wel- I guess it kind of borders on what do you value more. The invasion of the person's privacy or the possible danger to other people. <SEP> So. It gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society. I guess that's been the big role of government. Generally. <SEP> It's supposed to have been. That's kind of a difficult one to go into. I mean that particular case. It. Because there's a lot of people that they could require obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because there's a huge part of the population. Not a huge part but a. <SEP> A growing part. The AIDS population that have it that don't know they do are spreading it. But again to require such a test and then to make it is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things. I don't know. I don't know how exactly I feel about that. <SEP> Maybe chop their weenies off.
sw4376.txt:Your turn. I don't think they should abolish it. I think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got. But not for petty theft? <SEP>. For major things like premeditated murder. Mass murders. That type of thing. I don't think it should just be used loosely. It should be used as a deterrent do you think? Or should it be used. To prevent further crime? <SEP> To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street. By some technicality. And they go down the line ten years. And then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. <SEP> And that's about the only thing. For theft and stuff like that or manslaughter. I don't think they should do that. There's this old Jewish saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I guess if it was someone in my family I'd probably feel that way. <SEP> I've never had anybody in my immediate family murdered. And so I really wouldn't know. But I feel like if I did I probably would feel that way. One of the things I was thinking about is from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value. So if you have someone that destroys that value then you want to take steps to minimize the loss. Of course you have to also put value on the criminal. <SEP> So if you terminate him that's a loss of value. That's true. So if you weight everyone equally then you have to say the likelihood of not terminating him. If you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person. In other words you'd have to murder more than one other person in order to justify taking his life. <SEP> Besides him. Another way you could do it is weight this value by the value to society of the people. Which is pretty delicate thing to do. But one way of doing it is by income. So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then he's obviously not worth very much. <SEP> His life isn't worth very much then. And so the likelihood that maybe expected murders by him is integrated over the income of the people that he murders is maybe a loss of eight hundred thousand dollars. But if integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him. Of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's easier to terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less. Which means <SEP> I suppose you could say that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation. Potential. That's the key right there. Potential. <SEP> Are they rehabilitative or not. That's all fine and well and good philosophical. But if you're involved yourself personally. I know I have a friend whose son was murdered on the night before his sixteenth birthday. And let me tell you I knew them personally not intimately but quite well. And you're talking about real trauma. Trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies. <SEP> I can imagine. The father. Of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get in terms of psychological impact. And. <SEP> Was he murdered? Did they find who killed him? They found him. And he is on trial for capital murder. So it hasn't been a long time ago. Just recently. Actually. He was convicted. And of course now you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process. But. <SEP> That appeals process it's what just drags out and out and out. My brother-in-law here in Texas my sister's husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy actually in Houston. And he.
sw4336.txt:I'm not sure how it is in Georgia. But in Pittsburgh the crime rate really is not very high at the moment. Is that true for Atlanta? Atlanta is kind of high. It's lower than it has been in the past. I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off. And usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher. I. That's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere. <SEP> What kind of crime problem do you usually run into? Any specifics? From what's on the news there are very few actual robberies reported of residences. What's more likely to occur is knocking over a small store or a car theft things of that nature. Very few assaults. Although on the college campuses there are cases of people getting from an automated teller and somebody trying to device a scam for getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners. But mostly petty things and nothing really too big. <SEP> I guess here we run into that sometime. But I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins. There are some but not very high. As far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either. There were one case where this one guy was taking women from the teller and making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all. <SEP> So that's kind of like a double assault there. A strange case that happened about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine. It was a free standing machine. And they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it. <SEP>. There's a crime for you. <SEP> There's a crime. But I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty innocuous. Although from what I hear in the news. And I saw an episode of the T V show COPS one time that was in Pittsburgh. And it did surprise me because they were doing drug arrests and things like that. But I don't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what's reported in the news at least it's not all that common. <SEP> I don't know. Crime situations here they. Like I say lot of cases is usually just apartments and break ins and things like that. And a lot of it is due to drugs. Drug related in most cases. It's not like it's someone do steal a or television or V C R or something like that. It is for drugs because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se. You going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it. <SEP> So you really not making a sizeable profit. So it's not really lucrative to take chances like that even though it does exist. I live in an apartment. Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh. And the apartment would be very easy for just about anyone to break in. But even so it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to lock the doors when they go out and things like that. <SEP>. It would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in. <SEP> There's a T V and a V C R. And they could get in pretty easy and especially since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open while they're upstairs playing music. It could still happen then. <SEP> That's true. But you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not participating in any type crime. I guess there was one case. I was surprised. So happened this person worked at the same place. I work for Georgia Tech. And they work at the same place I did. But I didn't know that they had been watching me. Because I was getting ready to go in my car one morning. And the first thing they said is you don't have to be to work at eight. Shock.
sw4877.txt:. I guess you're probably in the same situation we're in. We're kind of past having to provide child care. Our kids are grown up. We don't have any grandchildren yet. But they're. How old are your children? <SEP> One's twenty-six. And the other is twenty-one. So they're getting there. They're going to be getting there. <SEP> There's no prospects right away for anything to happen. I see. <SEP> But. I have five children. I have a eighteen year old son. The rest of my girls are twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine. And I have three granddaughters right now. <SEP> And I. One's in Iowa. And she's a teacher. And what she does is she teaches at a preschool. <SEP> And so she kind of. And they let her bring her little daughter in for free. <SEP> So. But she just works part-time. Then I have another daughter in Bountiful Utah. And she has to work full-time. And it's just tearing her apart. She has a private baby-sitter. <SEP> And the baby just screams. The baby is seventeen months. And she just screams. Even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there. They're not even there yet. <SEP>. It's hard. We. And then I have a seven month old granddaughter. And her mother stays home. And they live with us. As Orange County is really expensive. <SEP>. They live with us. And so of course we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time. But she just. She used to work in the preschool and child care. And she says after working in there. And here she was a provider. But there's only so much one person can do. <SEP> She said it's so awful. She said she'll never put her child in a preschool. I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere. <SEP> But it's really very difficult. And. What did you do when your kids were growing up? Were you. When. The first ten or twelve years I stayed home. <SEP> And then after that I went to work. And a couple of times I just. Then I had one job. And then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job. And then later I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter. Supposed to be good recommended person from the church. And I knew her personally. She had two kids of her own and everything. But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child. <SEP> First of all her children were sick all the time. So when my son stayed over there he got sick. He got sick. Same thing that her kids had? <SEP> And so we didn't take her over there until about eleven o'clock. Then she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten. But s-. That day I was saying he's sick. And she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have. That's what he got. Goes. So it's not like he's going to infect her kids. But then what happened is I said he just threw up. And kindergarten starts at eleven thirty. So she said she'll keep him home. And he'll probably just sleep anyway. You know what. That woman sent him to kindergarten. She sent him to kindergarten. As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him. And he threw up again. And they put him in the nurse's office. <SEP> Guess so. And then what happened is they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter. Called her. And they said that he's sick. She wasn't home. All her kids were sick. But she wasn't home. And her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick. Why didn't she keep him home with her? She didn't do that. So it got to the point where he's supposed to get out of kindergarten about two thirty. And I had to leave work. It was five o'clock in the evening. And I found out he was still there at school. And they were calling me. And they said somebody's got to pick him up. And I kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives two blocks away from the school. I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. And he had a hundred and four fever. They couldn't give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything. <SEP> I was so furious. I quit that job. And I stayed home for awhile longer. Then I went and got a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better. A little more flexibility. You can come and go. But I haven't had any really very good experience with child care. <SEP> When our kids were small we had a couple of good women who would often get them to come to the house.
sw4346.txt:. You go first. I have two kids. I have one seven and one five. <SEP> And they're in a public school here in Tyler. And I'm happy with it. I'm happy with the school. It's great. Good teachers. Good curriculum. They learn a lot. They have no problems. But I do live in the best part of the city. Though I live in the real richy part I guess. I'm not. <SEP> But everybody around me is. But they're. I have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town. And their schools are kind of rundown and older. And they don't really offer as much as the school that my girls are in. I don't really think that's fair. But I'm happy with what they're in. Go ahead. <SEP> It's pretty much what I was going to say. Is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in. I grew up in New York. And the place. <SEP> Or not New York City upstate New York. And I went to the City of Rochester School District. <SEP> And a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs. And we weren't too far removed geographically from each other. But the difference in schools was pretty substantial. And one of the things that probably would have been better is if the entire county had just one school system. <SEP> And that could result in more equitable distribution of money. Because what was happening was all the very rich people move out to the suburbs. And the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with. As a result the schools were rundown. There wasn't as many of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked. There wasn't as many advanced placement courses when I was a senior that some other schools had. <SEP> And it. So I think that one of the ways to help schools in general and get them all to a minimum level of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people. And the problem with that is then the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools. <SEP> It's kind of you end up like a dog chasing its own tail sort of. Also the the family environment. You can come to south Tyler where I live. And you have got room mothers in every room. You've got art mothers. You've got every holiday. There's parties. All these kids have these really supportive parents always up there for something. You can go to north Tyler to the schools. And the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. <SEP> That has a whole lot to do with it. As far as their learning if the parents aren't willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning they really don't have much of a chance at all. <SEP> Why is that? <SEP> Why is that? Why you asking. They just don't. I'm up there at my kids' school. I know what they're learning. And if they're up I call and find out. Is she having problems. Does she need help with anything. She's doing fine. And I know kids that their parents could really give a rip. And the kids are not motivated. <SEP>. They have no motivation from home. So they just go to school. And I'll get through the day and bring homework home. And there's nobody to sit them down and say you're going to do this. <SEP> Just they take a notion to do it. They do. And that doesn't work either. They have to have guidance. And they can't just have it at school and then come home. And there's nothing. <SEP> I know that that was a big factor for me. I ended up coming out of the public school system very well and was very good education. Ended up getting some scholarships to go to college which is really nice. <SEP> And I think the difference for me was that they were always there. Was. Of course you're going to study and do well. And that's the way. Of course are you.
sw4364.txt:Do your privacy being invaded at any time? One of the things that I found to be an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the credit card bill. That is something that is not required. Yo-. <SEP> And in fact it is actually prohibited. But it doesn't stop many people from doing it. And it's one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic research. And to get your phone number on lists for phone solicitations. That you can still I've always done that. I started. Once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse. And I say what are you going to do. You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine. <SEP> I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all. And then ultimately they say no. You don't have to put it down. But really it's part of this compliance thing. The thing I don't like. I know that certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles. <SEP> That really burns me because you're required. You have to do that. And nowhere does it asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone. <SEP> And I think that it's one thing to voluntarily give it because someone asks. You can always refuse. But it's another thing where it's required by law. And then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. That. I don't think they have the right to do that. <SEP> I agree with you there. That's something that people have seen. Here's an easy way to make some money. But I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not. I've heard fairly recently some talk about that in my state. The budget problems up here are pretty tense. And people are looking for alternate ways of. Enhancing revenue is the phrase they use. And they were talking about selling the D M V lists. And there was a lot of consternation about that. And the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea. But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made public that you don't know about. <SEP> That's easy. Whenever you donate money to someone? You become put on something like a sucker list. And you start getting millions of calls or solicitations. <SEP> And then y-. It kind of makes you feel from doing it again. Like National Public Radio or any of the public stations. <SEP> I think I sent in money once to public T V. And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine. <SEP> I. It's like. And it just started soon after I had done that one. And I just said this is terrible. And that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college. <SEP> And it's one thing. They don't sell the list. But the thing that makes me mad is then they start getting other people. The people do these phonathons. And they call you up. And they actually happen to be people who graduated in your class or something like that. And they say we know you. You had contributed x amount last year. Can you do better this year? And hold on here. <SEP> How do you know that? How do you know that? Why you even telling me this? Is it any of your business? It's one thing that I and the college knows that. That's just our business. There's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all. <SEP> Just. And that was very offensive too. I. And so. Last year the Lotus Development Company the company that puts out One Two Three was planning on marketing a C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria. <SEP>
sw4330.txt:Does the company you work for test for drugs? They just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting. Because when I went to work for them they didn't do that. But since then they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company requests that we do that. <SEP> How about you? We're not being tested for drugs at all. Our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section or its reasons for immediate dismissal. It says use of narcotics on company premises. <SEP> So that's pretty general. But I work for an environmental management firm. And I'm an engineer there. But I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites. But I don't operate any machinery. <SEP> Now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program. Because they're at a higher risk of exposure. And blood screening is part of that. And I think that drugs. They do test for drugs in that capacity. But it's not their exclusive. It's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. <SEP> But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field. What is the nature of your company's business? It's actually. We do oil well services. So a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies. And they go out to. We have engineers who go out to the client's oil well and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff. So the clients are very concerned that the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their territory and everything. But the thing that's interesting is that I'm an engineer a software engineer. <SEP> And I work in the software house. And everybody there are all software engineers. They never go out to the oil rigs or anything. And yet we're subjected to this policy the same one that all the engineers have to. A little different actually. But we have to go through the same thing. It's a little different than a lot of drug policies. In our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you. And then if you get injured on the job if you trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away. Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that. But a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first. Particularly we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol. And they didn't find any problem with that. But. <SEP> That's been an issue in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening. In fact they'll have these little parties. And people will just get. I've. My brother lives where I work. And I have many a time called him to come get me. But they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. But I think drug testing. And I don't know. I think it's got some relevance. But I think its relevance is pretty limited. I think. In your case I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. <SEP> I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. It's really bizarre. Particularly where we are. I. There was a story of a woman last year who actually did slip on the ice and sprained her ankle. And she was a personnel secretary. And she had to get tested. And I don't know. I'm ambivalent about the whole thing. I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if. They should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense. And it's like employments are contractual by nature anyway. <SEP> But I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job where I had to do a drug test. And it was kind of a long story. But it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through. And it amounted to going in before any of these interviews. I'm not even working for this company. I'm going in for interviews. And they flew me out to Chicago. And before I went into any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical. They said it was going to be a physical. And actually beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening. But I had forgotten about that. And so basically I'd already peed off in that morning. And when I got in there I wasn't able to give a full sample. And so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again. <SEP> And the procedure is utterly humiliating. You go in there with the doctor. He makes you take off all your clothes. And then he examines you.
sw4659.txt:What do you think? I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago because I'm not that old yet. <SEP> I can be. But go ahead. I know that. Obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change. You didn't have video games. You didn't have home computers. You didn't have Xerox machines. <SEP> You try to. You go into a business today. And you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper. And it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and everything have become such a part of the way we live. We fax everything. And. <SEP> We don't even wait for the mail anymore. <SEP> A business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail. And you had to do something. This was concerning the S E C. And so if they had business to do they had to finish it three days in advance so they could get it through the mail. And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute. Because you can get it there in a matter of minutes through a fax machine. <SEP>. <SEP> And because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder. Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute. You're expected to. And I recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse. It should be less because we have a microwave. And our grandmothers had to bake brownies. And we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes. But the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us. <SEP> And we have no down time. We don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to. So we keep moving. We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen. We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing. So we have no relaxation time in between. <SEP> So they say that's really a bad thing. That you need to learn a lot of ways to deal with that and get your time in between things. So that's good. That's an interesting point. But I just think our family lives have changed drastically. <SEP> And I think that's ju-. Of course a part of it is technology. Our kids where would they be without Nintendo and their T V shows. And no-. Some of that is really bad I think. But we have all single families. So many single families now. A lot of working. Both parents are working. So there's a whole big effect on our kids. And not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father. I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years. There's that. And there's the fact that nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen. The U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country. <SEP> You're probably right. And I'm an O B nurse. And that's never really occurred to me but that's interesting. I never really thought about it that way. I saw the numbers on that awhile back. And I was uh-huh. So. That's true. When is this good or not good. <SEP> In terms of the long term effect on America in terms of the culture and everything I don't know. We don't know that yet. An extremely large part of the next generation is going to be second generation from immigrant parents. I don't know either. <SEP> That's true. <SEP> And they're going to be really struggling. And I don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good. It's no longer the accomplishment that it once was. And not that many people are really trying I don't think. That's kind of scary. That's true. But I. It's just very very different. And I guess every ten years it's just been very different. <SEP>. And I don't know what's going to happen. I know what I'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers. Tha-. And they've got their homes. And they've got.
sw4366.txt:Julie are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with special care for elderly? I don't know. My grandfather is ninety-two years old. <SEP> And he is still living by himself. My grandmother died a couple of years ago. But he doesn't want to move away. He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm. And he recently had to have an operation. But he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home. <SEP> Is he able to still do everything himself pretty well? He was until this operation. He has arthritis. And now I don't really think he's doing that well. And a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him. And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot. <SEP> But my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three. And died six weeks after they put him in the home. <SEP> And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather's feelings. Because I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left. And for a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over. And I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. <SEP> They can look after a lot of things. But there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. I know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home. And they died. But they were all younger than your grandparents. They were in their eighties. That type of thing. But I did I guess. When I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically. But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job. And that's difficult part. Because I think what they often get used as is almost like a very high level or long-term care similar to a hospital. <SEP> I know here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in four levels. And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care. Generally are not able to look after themselves to a very great extent physically. Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease or physical and mental handicaps. Where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. Even though it may be minimal. But I think that it can be helpful in that it gets people the level of physical care they need. But I don't. At least I think some nursing homes do that. But I think a lot of nursing homes really are guilty of neglect. <SEP> And I think it happens more in areas where it's a broad social medical system where there's government medical care and that kind of thing. If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals. And I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding. I think that a majority of the places in the U S there is some government aid available. But the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay. And if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely.
sw4340.txt:What kind of crime do you think is the most prevalent in our society? Probably robberies people stealing from each other. Such as New York City? <SEP> Is that what happens up there a lot? That's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen. That's the most prevalent crime. The ones that really add up after a while far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs. Everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually. I wonder if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because so many people use it. And even though just using is not really. It is a crime. That is a crime. I guess when you count all the little things that people do like. Speeding is a crime. That's true. <SEP> I break that law every day. But I was staying in the realm of felonies versus misdemeanors and drug use. Actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor. But what kind. Have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything? <SEP> I've been caught with marijuana before. So I guess that was a crime. I got a year's probation for that. But. That's not that much. Those aren't. It wasn't that big a deal. <SEP> I. When I think of crime I think of stuff that affects other people like people getting killed or raped. I think rape is one of the worst crimes. I think it is. In some ways it's almost worse than murder. <SEP> It's very degrading. And. Murder is hard on the people that were related to. <SEP> It is a rather final solution though. Once a person's gone then it's. But the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life. What do you think is an appropriate punishment for things such as rape or murder or something like that. <SEP> For a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is. It's a pretty good thing. I agree with that. <SEP> They have that down here in Florida still. The electric chair. And. I think Virginia does too up here. Do they? I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy. And I guess usually they're always sure they got the right guy. But. I think the appeal process takes too long. <SEP> So do I. I think it from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year. If that. The sooner. A year's plenty of time for something to come out I guess. <SEP> Then there's been guys in jail for six years. And the other guy admits that he did it. And they. It's oops. But. The system isn't perfect. It's run by a bunch of imperfect humans. You do the best you can to make it perfect. You go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect. <SEP> But I think you have to accept some of the errors. I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment for murderers. I don't know if it would or not though. I don't think it's so much of a deterrent as it is a good way for vengeance for the relatives and family members. You know what I mean? And society probably too. <SEP> Just general society to. It kind of gets it off their chest. <SEP> It does. And it decreases the prison population. Which is significant. <SEP> I know that a lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other. <SEP> And they're the kind of crimes of passion and stuff like that. I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead. You might be able to stop people. They're thinking about it. They know they're going to get the chair if they get caught. Generally the crimes of passion and things like that are not premeditated. <SEP> They can be. But usually they aren't. They're spur of the moment. <SEP> That's right. And the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those individuals I think that you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time. <SEP> They could probably do it again. They would have no problems doing it again. That's right. They didn't have any time doing it the first time. And I think locking them up for fifty years doesn't do any good because as a taxpayer I'm going to pay one and a. <SEP> It do-.
sw4519.txt:Your turn. I start. We keep a budget to an extent. And we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions. And you need to make sure all your bills are paid. About yourself? I have to say I really don't have a budget. Both my wife and I grew up in families of rather modest means. And our family income at this point is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say. And we're both so frugal that we really don't need a budget. We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing. <SEP> I guess that really is sort of keeping a budget. You stay within your means. We stay within our means. But we don't do it by conscious effort. It just sort of happens automatically. <SEP> Although we just moved to California. And the cost of living here in California is rather pathological. Housing prices are from four to ten times more expensive than they were where I came from in Dallas. <SEP> You moved from Dallas to San Francisco. So that presents a real shock. That is a hugh difference. <SEP> Actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California. But. But you have good sour dough. And it's a beautiful place to live. It's God's country. <SEP> And one way you know that is that only God can afford it. So budget is not a problem for us. At least it hasn't been. It may be at this point. But up until this point it really hasn't been. When I was in undergraduate school a long long time ago I noted that the starting average monthly salary for engineers in my discipline was six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that. <SEP> And I noted at that point that if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever. So I stopped worrying about money. And it. Never have worried about money since then. <SEP> That's a system too. Sometimes it's a bit of a problem because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should. But I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of investments. But. Then again you said you are able to take trips. And you do obviously have enough to live on. So I guess you're indirectly budgeting. Just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal in spending the money. <SEP> So that's a form of budgeting. It's kind of a strange topic for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money. I guess we're both lucky in that regard then. How big is your family? <SEP> We have one on the way. I see. My wife. And then we're having one on the way in September. How. Once you get ten children though you may have. <SEP> I think it's just going to be one. How about yourself? I have two kids. One nine and one thirteen. <SEP> And they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point. Do they budget at all? Do you have them on an allowance? I give them an allowance. And they. I basically give my son ten dollars a week. And I put half of it in the bank. And I give him the other half in cold cash. <SEP> And he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank. But at least it isn't burning a hole in his pocket. If he wants to use it he has to go get it. And that usually.
sw4327.txt:I lived over in Europe for a couple of years. I lived in Germany. And in Germany they don't have the jury system. What they do is they have three judges basically. And you get up there. And the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence. And your defense attorney presents their evidence. And those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not. Our judicial system is in such total chaos. <SEP> I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it. When you have a man that's signed a statement saying he's guilty. We have a family called All day family. They were all murdered. All the people signed confessions. They went to a trial by jury. They been trying these people now for twenty-two years ever since I was a child. <SEP> And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done. Has nothing to do with justice whatsoever. It's one of those things. I would have to look at it. If they did it with just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight. Because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures. They know what's good and what isn't. They'd be able to say I'm sorry. You can't use this as evidence because it was either illegally obtained or whatever. And you wouldn't have this theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the jury. And then the judge says. Disregard that. Come on. Any jury's not going to disregard the evidence. That's true. I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself. That may very well be. <SEP> I hold it in the utmost contempt. My favorite is the police department. They're not aimed at the criminal. The judicial system is aimed at the citizens. Because you and I we have work schedules. We can be called at work. We have Social Security numbers. They can trace us down. We have telephones. Then we have checkbooks. Criminals have none of these things. They're real difficult to catch. And if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas we write a check. <SEP> So where do you think they target their efforts? That's true. You d-. They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals. How would you go about changing it? <SEP> That's a. I've nailed the problem down. But I. <SEP> Leave the details up to somebody else. I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about. I think to begin with you would have. Here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical. Yet you go out on the streets. And they're giving speeding tickets. <SEP> I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from. Talking about the lawyers what might very well cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases. It's kind of do it in the similar vein like V C R or television repair. If you take your T V in a lot of these T V repair places will say I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars. And if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it. He repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars. If he comes in and says I'll repair your V C R or somebody else's V C R for a hundred dollars gets in there. Maybe it's a blown fuse. Takes him two minutes. He fixes it. He still charges you that hundred dollars. So maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that whether it's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case. And that's it. I firmly believe in that. None of this. <SEP> Because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney? And here's this bum that didn't have a job. <SEP> And he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford. That's true. Who's paying for that? <SEP> You're talking to part of them that's paying for that. And you're talking to the other half that's paying for it. That's right. It's amazing. And when you stop and look at it the judges they're all former lawyers. <SEP> That's another problem. I think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it. They're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever. And with that type person running it you could expect that you.
sw4679.txt:Why don't you go ahead and start. I think the court systems could stand some improvement. Trial by jury is good. But a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness. And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me. I don't know. So you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence? <SEP> I think so. I attended a trial in Germany when I was a student. And that's the sort of system they have. The trials are held by a panel of three or four judges who are. They're like lawyers I guess. They're experts in the law. <SEP> And there really isn't a jury. And they do the questioning also. The judges do the questioning. And they. I-. I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because the judge is also sort of a jury. But I'm not sure I like that. I think I prefer the jury system myself. <SEP> You think you prefer the jury? You think your chances are better? Actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury. What I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual. That's where you really need a jury of peers. Because anytime the government is the government against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens. That's true. I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is there ought to be a. I guess I don't think that juries need to decide sentencing all the time. <SEP> I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that. Or. Sometimes the sentencing is not fair. The jury I guess they do decide that. But I'm like you. In a case like that most of the time its. I don't know. Maybe I'm too conservative when it comes to that. The sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases. <SEP> If you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent. That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe. But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe a little bit naive. <SEP> In Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people. It's kind of a hanging jury atmosphere. <SEP> But in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way. But I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it. Some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that. I kind of like that system. <SEP> That's not a bad system. But I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit. But the thing is too maybe they need more of a expert types to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in. <SEP> And lawyers blow sand in their eyes. <SEP> I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries. Insurance cases and things like that. <SEP> Where. And there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of people's heart strings and making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering. Putting on a act or whatever. <SEP>. So. I think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government. But.
sw4649.txt:I've had three boys through some child care each one of them. And now they're in school. So it's all over. But I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want. I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months. Is that right. I guess the only rule I can think of is that I like to look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that. If they're associated with a college or a university they're usually a pretty good bet. <SEP> I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something. You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care. I guess not. Usu-. I suppose you're absolutely right there. For profit places I would really look at them awfully carefully. <SEP> But when my kids were young I was teaching at a university. And the child care center associated with our university was quite good. So I felt confident that they'd do right. <SEP> Of. Don't everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? for their pet theories or some such thing? You mean learning type. Actual experiments they would have to get your permission. But. I suppose if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another. I guess that's true. But I never had bad experience in that respect. Of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents. And they. Pretty good people. <SEP> The thing I really worry about is the sexual abuse cases you read about. And you'd just feel awful if something like that happened. I never really worry very much about it. I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public. So I never really worried too much about that being the case with my boys. <SEP>. I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them. But. <SEP> I don't think it's as common as the newspapers would make you believe. And another thing is cost. I mean that. <SEP> I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now. And in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare. In our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school. And I'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult. And I think it was the right thing to do. <SEP> And we just decided that we would do it. And we went ahead. But not everybody can make that choice. And even though my wife wasn't working we did have one or another of the boys in child care just for part of the day. Or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house and so on. So we did look around. I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not. So I would always trust her judgment on that. <SEP>. I'm just thanking heaven. My husband just got a new job. His last company he was only working four days a week. <SEP> So it's. And he just got a new job. He's getting lots of overtime. He got a pay raise. And so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not. There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid. So do it as long you can. I suppose. But I think you have to look through a place. And you have to get a feel for how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them. <SEP>. And the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open. That you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth. And if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere. <SEP> You have to start wondering if they don't want you. <SEP> You have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care? I have one. But I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while. But I really think the news reports tend to sensationalize the problems. <SEP> I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and things like that rather than these really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy. <SEP> This is true. CURRENT AFFAIR can get several shows child cases. <SEP>
sw4890.txt:With regard to jury trials. I really feel as though whatever system has been used historically is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is based on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it. What do you think? <SEP> I don't think so. Possibly in the jury selection would be the only. Just for example what we're seeing in California I guess. It makes you wonder had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome. And the problems that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating. Just makes you wonder whether or not they. Won't. Maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that. But then the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently. <SEP> And the other two guys sat in the car. That's bad. <SEP> And they didn't get beat up. It. Rodney got beat up because he involved himself in some self-destructive behavior. <SEP> And just like the burning and looting is self-destruct. Everybody says this is the nineties. <SEP> And they're going to rebuild. And it'll be even better. What do you think. Some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area? That's right. With everybody with that mind set. That whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto. <SEP> They're only going to suffer. And you might even be able to use it for a bombing test site. They're only going to suffer. They've defeated themselves with their looting and violence. I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the tape. And. Everybody is saying this is going to be a new era. And we're going to reexamine this thing. The average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed. They're a bunch of animals. How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything. Forty deaths. There are forty people that are dead as a result of that. <SEP> I know. It's really ridiculous. And I'm just trying to determine how you weigh Rodney getting the hell beat out of him against forty deaths. <SEP> Against forty other people being. And there's no other. I'm not exactly sure what the circumstances surrounding the deaths. And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and pursued it because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing. Those deaths. <SEP> Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner? I. No tears. Or just an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what. But I suspect a number of them. <SEP> You see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot in the street. <SEP> Or beaten. And my reaction is I would have run over fifty people rather than stop. And there would have been just nothing but carnage after if I'd been at the wheel. No one would have stopped me. <SEP> That's exactly how I feel too. They wouldn't have stopped my car for anything had I seen them coming. But I was just wondering since you're back east and a little closer to the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here. I'm inside the beltway. <SEP> You know how they always say inside the beltway they think thus. And I say wait a minute. I'm inside the beltway. And I don't think like that. I'm a government employee. <SEP> In what section of the government do you work? I'm with the F B I. That's interesting. And the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick who's another government employee wanted segments of my speech that were done a year ago. <SEP> <SEP> And he wanted another collection a year later. And so this is my seventh call. A year ago I did eleven calls. <SEP> I see. And so that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate.
sw4908.txt:Around here we have a program where we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers. And we keep the newspapers in a. They're collected twice a month and the trash and this bottled stuff that is put in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck. So they actually have about three passes at this collection. One for the regular trash one for the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers. Sounds. <SEP> But I gather you do not separate the bottles and cans. They do that on the truck. <SEP> They separate them as they dump them. And one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there. And I think they're running out of. The sanitary landfill is running out. Of course you being from New Mexico you've probably been to Washington. Especially if you're your present location. You must have come to Washington at least once. I know. Not only have I come to Washington but I find it very amusing that the thing that was just instituted here is very similar. That is we also have blue bins. We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and landfill space is in deed the driving factor here. And in fact despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still very hard to come by. <SEP> You've got a lot of nothing out there. A-. They got. There's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill. But if somebody can make a regulation about it they will. <SEP> What unique things you think that you can do about it in Los Alamos? Other than nuking it. Other than nuking it. <SEP> In fact Los Alamos has done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general. It involves for instance creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and other things from waste material in general. And purify the waste of specific nasty elements. That's pretty upscale trash situation. I don't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques getting rid of the heavy metals. <SEP> And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody made some special polymers that have the ability to make certain actinide elements adhere to them. They've looked at plutonium and uranium and some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste. <SEP> And again this is driven by all of the documentation and E S and H considerations that people are worrying about much more than they should. Actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable. We-. Back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center. And in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper. <SEP> That's certainly getting into the swim of things. I think it should go to the heart of the matter though and say guy. Everybody gets five pounds of garbage that they can throw away. But more than that every week you've got to pay by the pound. I think they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff. I think that's a wonderful idea. <SEP> The only alternative I would see is. If you did it by volume rather than by weight it would speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill. And it would also cause people to compact their garbage more. <SEP>. And limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight. <SEP> Of course those big trucks probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor.
sw4314.txt:. We have. We used to when I was younger. <SEP> We'd go every weekend. But we haven't done whole lot of it lately. I'm kind of into it. I'm kind of a sailor. <SEP> I'm up in Minneapolis now. But I was in Florida. So. I was kind of into it for a while there. Were you sailboating? For the most part. <SEP> I had a little sail. We don't get to do a whole lot of that up here. <SEP> Just motorboat's all we. What part of Texas you from? Nacogdoches. Whereabouts is that? <SEP> That's between Houston and Dallas. It's the oldest town in Texas. Is that right? <SEP> That's pretty wild. We have Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches. So we do a lot of boating on. So you got some lakes around you can do that on. <SEP> You do skiing and stuff. Or. Little bit. <SEP> Just got through snow skiing. <SEP> Just came back from Denver. But. That sounds good. Our. The snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now. It was heavy when we were there though. <SEP> I didn't see any boats there though. Not too many. But. I just got back from a weekend. We went and had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing. It was pretty nice. But I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I did a lot of sailing on and stuff. <SEP> That's a lot of fun. But my parents are pretty big sailors too. They're kind of into it. All we have up here mostly bass boats. I guess fishing's a pretty big thing. <SEP>. Lot of fishing going on up here. So where about in Texas is that? Is that centrally located. Or. <SEP> It's. You ever heard of Lufkin? What major city is nearby? Houston. And that's south or north of there or something? <SEP> Let me see. Houston's north. Dallas is south. That sounds pretty good. Does. I guess the weather. Does that stay pretty constant there. Or. <SEP> It's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons. Probably seventies eighties in the afternoon. That's pretty temperate. That's not too bad. But. Have you done any other boating then. Or. <SEP> I hadn't done any lately. But that's all. I used to have a friend that his daddy owned a boat shop. And when I was in high school we used to go boating every day just about. That's great. I. <SEP> And we had a different boat every day. That's fantastic. I used to kind of be that way myself when I lived in north western Florida in the panhandle. I used to sail about every day. I'd go to work. I'd like to do some sailing. It's a lot of fun. It's. Especially if you get a pretty fast boat. Those catamarans are pretty fast. <SEP> What. You can actually. If you get one like that do have somebody teach you that. Or they just. Actually I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life. My family's pretty into it. <SEP> And I took sailing lessons when I was about six. And then. Is it pretty easy? It's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it. <SEP> So it's not too bad. It's pretty easy to get the hang of I think. And generally everybody I've known has kind of gotten into it. But some people are more motorboaters which is fine. <SEP> That's about all we have. Lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing. But then again they may never have tried anything like catamaran. And that's when you really start getting into speed. Some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers. They get so fast. <SEP> I didn't know that. They get pretty quick. But. That would be something. <SEP> I haven't personally done that. But the races. I work with a guy right now that races catamarans in the summertime. And he's pretty gassed about it. He's got a good. <SEP> What lake do you all use? He's from Detroit. So he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes and does his sailing. For me I go back to Orlando in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast. We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast. And there's a lot of places there you can go. So that's a good thing. <SEP> But so what do you do for a job? I build transformers. <SEP> Is that for T I. Or. It's for Cooper Industries. Are they primarily electronic then? <SEP>. That. <SEP> They have a worldwide. But. All we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that. <SEP> How do you like it down there in Texas? It's real nice. <SEP> Been here all my life. No doubt. I've never been to Texas. I've been to Oklahoma. But that's about as far as. <SEP> Oklahoma's nothing like it. That's good because I didn't like Oklahoma that well.
sw4834.txt:I guess by what you said you don't feel your privacy has been invaded anytime recently? Not really. The only thing that annoys me is when people call and you have solicitation calls. <SEP> That's the only thing that bothers me. That's not really invading my privacy. Do you feel that yours is invaded? I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. I would. There's a lot of times though you get those calls when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot. And next thing you know someone calls and wants to sell you this or that. And it's real hard to tell them that you're not interested. Or you do tell them you're not interested. And they still keep asking you and keep badgering you about it. And that aggravates me. But I don't know that you could call that invading my privacy. Because if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look I want my name unlisted or want my. <SEP> But that doesn't work. It doesn't? Because a lot of times they dial sequentially. They get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything. <SEP> You enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something. You put your phone number on there. They pass your phone number on to another company. Or you. Or the newspapers they just dial randomly and stuff. The newspapers here even call people who already subscribe. <SEP> And while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they. You call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing. <SEP> And the local papers ask them to remove your number from their list. And. You call up during regular hours. They have a special department. They'll take your numbers out of their lists. But the Orlando paper they refused to take it off of the lists. And they call every month. <SEP> And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have. Let me ask you about this. Here's something that has been kind of concerning me lately. My fiance received a bill from a Lord and Taylor company. They're a department store. <SEP> She received a bill from them that she had visited some sto-. And I think it was there in Florida. Maybe it was in Miami. That she had visited a store there. And they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise. And the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving. <SEP> And apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number. And I've heard recently that this is a common occurrence where people are using s-. They use Joe Blow's social security number and can potentially ruin someone's credit. <SEP> If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address and their mother's maiden name you can basically become that person. <SEP> If the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to. And since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove that it wasn't her. If it was some coming into the store and stuff then whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of document. <SEP> And wh-. The signature. They should be able to provide you a copy with that signature. And if they can't provide a signature they'll have to eat the charge. Y-. But if the pers- has her social security number I'd be real concerned that she's not blacklist on Telecredit or something? <SEP> Because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there. She probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle. We got it cleared up eventually. What happened.
sw4785.txt:Kids too? You laugh. How many. What ages? <SEP> Twenty-seven up. And we had five. You've been through the fun part. <SEP> And how about yourself? I have a four and a half and a three. <SEP>. So. It's. I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way it's done now and then. When mine were growing up I did some traveling but not that extensively. But I always just made it a point to spend about ten minutes with each one of them. <SEP> So it was an hour. But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them. What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest? <SEP> Six years. So they were all real close? That's tough. That's a lot of time. <SEP> We look back and wonder how we did it. Did you both work? Your wife too? She never did. Qualify that. <SEP>. She worked at home I'm sure. But that's. Both my husband and I work. And sometimes I feel like by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening. <SEP> Maybe thirty minutes max. That's plenty though. And he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking. And then I spend time with them while he's doing other stuff. And of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend. There's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it. But it's neat. It's straight. And I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids. <SEP>. With kids you're not going to have a neat house. I've accepted that too. <SEP> And it's tough to find time. Especially with both of them working. That's true. It is. <SEP> That's true. And you just have to set the time and say this is going to be it. That's true. And we do a lot of that on the weekends. We try to spend Saturdays together. <SEP> If my husband golfs he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence. And we do a lot of family things together. We're kind of going the other direction this weekend. We're planning a trip just he and I. This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago. <SEP> That's good too. That's good that way too. I decided that you need that once in awhile. That you need to plan the quality time. And I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day. <SEP> They say all it takes is about five ten minutes a day. And as the kids got older I made them help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too. Or whatever. <SEP> And. And they think that's a family activity. <SEP>. That's great fun. And. If. My daughter's Mommy can I help you with the laundry? Of course you can. <SEP> Just keep them talking that way. But another thing we used to do is have family councils. Every Sunday night. <SEP> And what would you do. What? Discuss everything that didn't agree with them. And we'd take turns being president. <SEP> And everyone would get one vote. And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two. But it never worked that way. So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week. <SEP> And we could bring up stuff too. And then. <SEP> And that was always good time. We really got to know the kids well. I imagine. And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them. In fact they were all in over the weekend for Easter. I. <SEP> That's wonderful. I was raised in that type of family where you don't disobey me you mind me. But if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it. We did too. <SEP> And I remember the one daughter saying we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree. And she said I don't make fun of your friends. So why make fun of mine? <SEP> Kind of hit us between the eyes. You don't think of it that way do you. But that was always good quality time for us. That's good. I like that idea. <SEP> And then never attend. But if they missed it they had to abide by the rules. Whatever was voted on. <SEP> And they'd show up. I think that's great. And we'd usually take notes. <SEP> And the younger kids or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another. But they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us. And they loved it. I think that's true. I can remember times my parents would say what do you think would be a fair punishment. <SEP> And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done. So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves. <SEP> But I feel for you and your husband. Why is that? Two of my.
sw4379.txt:Kathy? Do you. So what is your family. What do you usually do as far as budgeting? <SEP> We have a very detailed budget. Because my husband is a finance major. And we have money that we take out each month for food and for gas and things like that. And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for other things. <SEP> Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year. And we budget them into what we call our needs and wants list. And so the things like a vacation. We have a vacation fund. We have a fund for the things we need. And then for the things that we want. <SEP> And we're continually putting into those each month how much we're going to need. And then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item. So we very rarely buy anything on credit. Everything we buy is paid for. My husband is a finance major also. <SEP> And we kind of have the same plan. We have one credit card. And every month we put the same amount in for retirement. And our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby. So we're budgeting each month an allowance for his education starting now. <SEP>. So that's in our budget every month now. That's the newest addition. But we too do the same thing as far as. We have a set amount. We take one big vacation a year and then maybe three small vacations. So an exact amount that we spend on that each year. <SEP> And. <SEP> We have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money. Instead of just writing checks for things. <SEP> If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here. I see. And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for the vacation. That we put in for Christmas. You have a separate account for that then? <SEP> A lot of that I don't know how safe it is. I guess we keep it all in a safe here at the house. I see. And so it's actually pulled out. Then we keep our. I see. <SEP> We have a savings account for the kids' education. That money goes into there. Each of our. We have three children. So they each have their own account. I see. <SEP> That money is put into each month. Does your husband deal in stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff? Does he invest in that and for long-term? He does somewhat. <SEP> He does somewhat. We have an investment plan. I guess he does. <SEP> But we have really found. This is the first year we've done it this way. And we are really saving a lot of money. Because you've sat down with a piece of paper and said let's see what are we going to. What goes into that particular thing? It's vacations Christmas. <SEP> Christmas birthdays car maintenance dental medical. We just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental. And so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from. <SEP> We have it. And when we see something on sale instead of just looking in our checking account and saying we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill. Everything's taken care of. <SEP> And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought. What do you do as far as. I take it. Do you run the family budget as far as groceries and that sort of thing? <SEP> I do. All the money. And what's that? All the money is turned over to me. Do you have a set amount that you spend each month. Or how do you work that? <SEP> I have a set amount. It's very generous. And I usually have extra. <SEP> And so then that can go either back into our checking account. Or I can just carry it over. There are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months. And certain times when that will be left over. <SEP> But that's completely up to me how I do that. And then because I don't work. I stay home. I do too. I stay home also. <SEP> And so it's kind of my money. And I also get my own money to do what I want to. Go to lunches and do that kind of thing. We have a clothing envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing. <SEP> It really works out great. We're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that. And we're. What. As far as big things like something comes up and you have to buy a T V or a big item for the house. How. Do you have a household? We have a household budget. We're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year. <SEP> And also we need a new bed. And so we've got both of those budgeted. And we put a certain amount in each month. And we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those. And if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards.
