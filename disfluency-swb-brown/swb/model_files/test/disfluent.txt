sw4682.txt:Have you had that experience recently? Recently I can't really say recently. But I think about uh about a year ago uh I bought a product from some company down at uh in Atlanta Georgia. I believe it was one of these uh one of these uh mixers. These like these juice machines. And uh the uh the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay. Oh yeah. <SEP> But I found that uh it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh after. Oh. Even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about uh three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because i- I you know I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it. But uh it was really uh it was. I had to send it back after like you know the third week because I realized it was like it was not. Something was very very wrong with the blade. Uh what about you? Well I don't have so much trouble with products as service. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't feel like that's as big a problem. I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly. Uh-huh. And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh the one I have now is okay most of the time. Uh-huh. But that's it. But that's that's probably the worst. My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. Uh James Avery. I don't know if you have that up there. But it it's a very good company. That sells sterling silver things. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the catch broke. And she was sitting in school on a carpet. And when she stood up it caught and broke. And we took it back. And they said oh this was just obviously yanked. Uh-huh. This was yanked. I mean they were so rude about it. <SEP> Right. And so we wanted a different kind of catch. And she said well it's not guaranteed. And I said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed. So do it anyway. Uh-huh. So we got the kind we wanted. And I was really disappointed with that. I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends. And I called there to see if they had it. And the lady was very nice. And I said my goodness. I said you've been very nice what's your name. And she told me. And I said well I really appreciate it. I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store. And it turned out she was the assistant manager. So. <SEP> Well at least you're talking to somebody who counts. Right. So I felt kind of good about that you know. I didn't even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But I just felt like well at least I did something. Maybe they'll fix it. They might work on that you know. Right. Right. But I find attitudes are more of a problem. Service is more of a problem. <SEP> I find. Up here in the northeast we have uh well w- we have these mail order companies like L L Bean. And uh they are famous for I guess having really top-notch service. They've got uh. Really. I mean I've I've I I have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half. And even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition. And they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore. Uh they'll they'll actually do things like this. I mean they're really they they go- bend over backwards service wise for you. I've uh I've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call. That's really great. <SEP> I guess if if you call the e- any eight hundred number uh if you you can call up e- any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get uh the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies. And um actually I've tried that with a few companies lately. And they've most of them have been pretty good. But I I was. One reason why I like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through Bean or though. Uh I guess Bean's one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in uh I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere. They they are uh they're very good about uh insur-. Huh. Like the customer is always right. And you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding. And uh they usually get you know they they make things are they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise. That's really good. It use to be like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. But. I don't think most places are like that anymore. <SEP> Yeah. Well I think I guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is I guess. There was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are uh you know. Things are getting rough out there. There's a lot of you know. The morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know.
sw4611.txt:Hi. Hi. Uh uh I I should say something. <SEP> Uh-huh. That I'm the uh least informed. This is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic. But it's I'm the least informed person in the whole United States. This has not been determined yet. But I I I've never read a newspaper in my entire life. And I've I I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off. But. <SEP> Any particular reason? Well no. I I've I've explored that with lots of people. Uh they've tried to lock me up and uh things like that. But uh uh I'm basically not interested. And I also find the uh everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and mis- and off the uh uh. What am I trying to say. Uh. I do learn about things. Largely from friends. <SEP> Uh-huh. Huh. And I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS. You know someone will write a book about something. And then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier. Uh-huh. But it. And somehow. And anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always so uh covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it. But I mean I don't think it's just that I'm lazy. <SEP> I really don't. I I I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon. Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest. But assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas. Uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I guess you could explain it two ways. And and the cynical view is well these things aren't doing a very good job at all. And the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or uh particularly interested in buying something as a you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Yeah. <SEP> And I think the same thing is true with news. If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers a- and especially the better papers the the TIMES the WALL STREET JOURNAL the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> If you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much. Right. Doesn't want. Let me ask by the way just for the record. I I'm I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them. So I mean I'm not being elitist in that sense I hope. Uh. <SEP> Well I mean there's there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things. Yeah. What. And most people think it is. And I can I can you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it. Yeah. By the way when you say most people think it is. I think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is percent. <SEP> I don't think it's that high. Oh you don't? I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper. Right. <SEP> And I think they're saying well if something's really important I'll at least find out that it happened. Yeah. And and that's a that's is a reasonable start. And for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked. Uh and if something important happened it was covered on T V. And I could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels. Yeah. Uh I did on the uh the Supreme Court hearings ar- the for uh uh the whole business of uh. See I actually have a a. Clarence Thomas or. Yeah. The Thomas and Anita Hill business. <SEP> Right. I I mean that's that's the closest thing. I deeply cared about that. Uh-huh. Uh and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine. And when I arrived at her house she was engrossed in that. We ended up watching it for a couple of hours. Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea- watching it some more. And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on. But even then I didn't end up doing it on my own. Uh uh. <SEP> Yeah. I stayed as far away from those as I could. Uh-huh. I decided I didn't want to waste the time. I had I guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings. And afterwards decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in. And that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out. Right. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Do you ever read.
sw4765.txt:Uh a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either uh elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users. Uh-huh. And uh I know the the government is uh you know gives drug tests an- to all new entrants all new appli- applicants coming into government. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it. I I'm I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian. And and I I feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background. Of course we're we're. Being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks. And and so uh but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that. <SEP> Sure. Sure. And uh I have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to whatever it is to to you know break this uh activity. Huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs. And there isn't anything. But getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope. Yeah. What's your uh feeling? <SEP> Uh well I guess I I guess I'm probably a little more to toward the other direction. Uh well I guess mainly because uh it's I well. Like there's two sides to it I guess. Uh one is that uh if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then I I think that that you know I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot. Uh but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business. Uh and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go. You know we had prohibition for awhile. And then we didn't have prohibition. Uh you know we've had I guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years I guess. Uh-huh. <SEP> Maybe a little longer. Well I think uh the dr- the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that. Yeah. So ei- eighty years or so. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Uh so I. You know it's it's hard to I guess for me to justify what so- seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amen- you know freedom from uh search and seizure you know uh on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten. Who knows. Well the thing of it is the the tha- tha- that that is uh uh in in many respects uh uh you know just just I think an over simplification. I mean prohibition certainly didn't last. I I think there th- th- th- there's so much criminal activity uh that people go into to to support drug habits. <SEP> Well but you got to look at prohibition though. You had the same problems there right? Yeah. You know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that. Yeah. Oh yeah. Sure. Well it goes back to that again. If you look at prohibition. I mean because it's illegal it costs more. If it was legal. I mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce. I I I must admit that. <SEP> And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap. And you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it. Yeah. But yeah. Get uh. Yeah. I I must admit that the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and and the costs to society. Yeah. <SEP> Oh yeah. Well that's why there's you know people dealing it because there's money in it you know. There's ridiculous amounts of money. But I I I I think that that the that you know the being in law enforcement you know th- th- th- they I I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it. And but but the uh uh I I really feel as though the interdiction effort is is. As soon as you you get rid of one goon that's that's that's involved in drugs and tha-. <SEP> Oh yeah. Interdiction's hopeless. I mean. Yeah. And then another another one will jump up. There's no way you're ever going to win that. But we we see. <SEP> The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is. I mean that's a losing fight. Yeah. A- a- as soon as we wind up uh uh you know for. Well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand. But but people want to get get stoned. Yeah. Yeah. And I I don't see that. <SEP> Well yeah. It goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people. I mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen? Yeah. I don't think you can. I mean you know I'm you know was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic. So you know I'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people. Uh-huh. <SEP> So you know yeah. I can really relate to. Yeah. Everybody ought to do their own share. You know. I don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff. Uh-huh. But you know.
sw4608.txt:So um how do you feel about the crime in your city? Is it uh. Well um Minneapolis isn't too bad. Uh I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh that's kind of gone up in scale and and some other things. Uh I personally had a little experience the other day. Uh somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck. Oh really. But actually you know when you look at at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it's really quite a bit better. Uh because I came from Florida. Uh-huh. <SEP> And in Orlando there's crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever. So. Oh yeah. What part of California are you from? San Jose California. <SEP> Oh really? I have a good friend there. Here you know the real problems are the gangs. Yeah. A lot of gang related a lot of murders uh just in general the whole. We've only been here a couple of years. Uh before that we lived in Colorado. But in comparison to Colorado it's real noticeable. <SEP> Oh yeah. Uh-huh. I mean you can just feel I mean I can just sense. I mean I won't even I won't go to the grocery store at night. Yeah. Yeah. That's. You know. And it it's that kind of thing. And uh. <SEP> That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like. Yeah. We have a neighborhood watch program in the house uh the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce uh home theft burglary and things of that sort. Sure. Do you have that where you live. Or. <SEP> Well uh interestingly enough right before I moved up here. I'm an intern. And then I go back down in May. Uh-huh. Uh but in Orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it. Uh we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks. Oh no. <SEP> And one of the things that I I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there. Uh-huh. Uh because they were just. It's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> And then the houses were left unguarded uh. But yeah. I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it. That's a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch. Yeah. Well you know uh also I've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home. Like on the weekends. <SEP> Oh is that right? A high percentage of uh free time. I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is uh spent doing yard work outdoors. Oh. So they wait while you're out outdoors. They know the house is unlocked. And then they just slip in. Slip in slip out you know. <SEP> That's amazing. They know exactly what they're going for. Yeah. So I've heard that's really on the rise as far as uh you know a new type of crime. <SEP> Uh. Yeah. It almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter. Yeah. <SEP> Really you know. Unfortunately yes. Yeah. Unfortunately it's starting to really you know look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced uh. Uh-huh. But uh yeah. I guess. I mean. <SEP> I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis. I'm not real sure. Uh. Yeah. It helps to know your neighbors you know. They give you. You're supposed to make lists of uh cars. Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar we we have a list. Is that what you you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates? Pretty much. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I was I was basically involved in that in the organization of it. Uh-huh. And then I left right in the middle of it. I'm not sure where we went from there. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> But. Yeah. Well. Yeah. That that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that sure. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean you you hate to be paranoid. But there are really only so many things you can do. You can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program you know uh as a woman not go out at night. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Uh you can do that which is what I choose to do. Yeah. One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited. Yeah. <SEP> Even even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps. Uh-huh. It's against the law to do a lot of things you know. They could basically uh. When I was getting robbed down in Florida I was really considering electrifying doors um things like that like. Uh-huh. That's. <SEP> Uh-huh. They did in Miami that time. But it's not uh. If you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home it's considered self-defense though. <SEP> That's not always true. It isn't? No. There was a there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed. Uh-huh. <SEP> And essentially what he had done is set a a elec- a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home. Uh-huh. Huh. <SEP> The guy came in while he was home. And sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned. He didn't die. But he was severely burned. And he took the guy to court and won a settlement. Really. Yeah. So that really that makes you think you know. Yeah. <SEP> It's like your hands are re- very much tied. Yeah. Well I think if if you had ha- a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's down-.
sw4646.txt:Do you know anyone that uh is is in a nursing home or has ever been in one? No. But I my grandparents were looking into it before. So I know what they've said. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well I'm trying to think. My uh uh wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's. And they were going to put her into a a nursing home. And uh they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble. And the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance. Or worse than a nuisance. I mean she sort of went you know bananas. Oh they thought it was too much of a bother. And they couldn't couldn't deal with her. So I guess you need to uh know whether it's a you know a no deposit no return kind of thing whether. <SEP> Right. If they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're going to have you know put in there too. Yeah. Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still. Right. <SEP> They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her. But they wanted to be independent as well. Have their own room. Right. My grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that uh. There was a retirement hotel and then a uh. There was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it. So for uh the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes. But could could also go and eat someplace else. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then uh as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to uh provide full-time care. And uh she didn't have to do anything anymore. But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly. And that's som-. I don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the the reason is. But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something. Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help. Yeah. <SEP> They need health care. So they're already ill before they go. Right. That's probably a large factor. Yeah. If if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are. Then you only go there as a last resort. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or people send you there as a last resort. Right. Right. That's what my grandparents. It was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them. Uh-huh. <SEP> So that was their thinking. Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency. Right. And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make. So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time. Right. <SEP> I guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all. Yeah. I guess. That uh. You can't always get in when you want too. And of course you can't just sit around and wait. Right. When you need it you need it I guess. <SEP> Yeah. And the money is also another issue. How you're going to pay for it. Right. <SEP> At that stage of life you only have so much money left. And I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings. Yeah. I mean it is kind of fair. But it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise. Sure. <SEP> So it's another problem. And you probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price. Right. Right. So it it's just so complicated anymore I think. People outlive their savings. And with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down. And they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore. Yeah. Well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing. <SEP> It's just a shame that's the way it has to be. I think the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay. Yeah. And cause like if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. To have friends. Right. <SEP> Yeah. I've known quite a few people that have uh gone to retirement communities. I don't know if they have them back there. But here in California and in Ari-.
sw4356.txt:So. Have you heard about Saturns? I've heard some about Saturns. I don't know a lot about them. I haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the I guess the Japanese cars. Ooh that's great. Actually that's kind of the type of car that I I'm thinking about we might get. Saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a a Saturn dealer. This this offshoot of G M. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And uh supposedly they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard. <SEP> Um. Yeah. I've heard a lot of people like them. Uh yet I don't know wh- whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point. I'm kind of. My card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky. And so uh. Well like what? Well let's see. I li- I like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind. <SEP> And that's not just the driver and the passenger. But that's the person who's working on it. Cause I do al- almost all my own maintenance and uh those types of things. Uh-huh. And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a ca- car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it's just not very eas- it's not very. Almost unlikely at this point. Yeah. <SEP> And uh yo-. Yeah. I've got a sixty-five Mustang. And I and I do the work on most of the work on that myself. Ooh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that I just say I will never do that with the modern cars. It's not worth my time. You can't get in there. You can't do anything. Yeah. And it's so complicated too. I look at it. And I say boy you know. I I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that. <SEP> Well I've got an eighty-three Saab. Uh-huh. And I find that for a normal you know everyday things. It's really very easy to work on. And so uh you know I'm kind of spoiled. I used to have a Chevy. Uh-huh. <SEP> With a three fifty in it. Yeah. And uh I really liked working on it. Uh cause it was pretty easy too. It was about a nineteen seventy. So I'm kind of uh biased in that. And you know I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore. Yeah. <SEP> And that's kind of that's that's probably one thing I'd look at. I think another thing I'd look at is safety. Yeah. That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about. Actually the car one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags. Huh. <SEP> That's a real nice car I think. Yeah. I've driven some uh Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. Uh as rental cars. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus. It's a really nice car. I think it's very it's a stylish car both inside and out. It's comfortable to drive. Uh reasonable performance. And this is out in California where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore. Yeah. Uh I've been real impressed with that. Yo-. And I didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now. Ninety. Yeah. Or excuse me the ninety-twos. The ninety-twos had dual air bags. <SEP> Uh-huh. This newest model. You could get them with duals. Oh I think that That's excellent. <SEP> That's excellent because. Yeah. But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars. Actually my my wife and I are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so. So we're actually been looking around and thinking about things. Oh. We'd like to get like a. Oh I don't know. What do you call it? A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Year old ninety-two or something like that. Uh-huh. Sure. Those are. See if we. <SEP> Yeah. That that would be a good deal to go with. And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too. Okay. Because they looked really nice. <SEP> Uh-huh. What do you what do you looking for in in those? What what attracts you to the Saturns? Or or of course we've already talked you know. The Taurus is safe. But wh- what kind of things are you looking for? Well the Saturns you can get air bags in them. I don't think you can get dual side air bags. Uh-huh. But one of the the two things that I'm really. The the I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems. <SEP> Uh-huh. You set down. You look at consumer reports. We've been pouring over consumer reports. And you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that. Yeah. Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have. And and the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the other one is are the Saturns. Uh-huh. So those two things. And then you know we kind of want a four door. <SEP> Okay.
sw4380.txt:Recently graduated from high school. Meaning like uh you know three or four years ago. I'm a senior in in uh college now. Uh-huh. And uh I can't really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system I went to was uh really superb even though it was a public school system. <SEP> Really? Yeah. I feel that my uh. I'm a junior in college now. And I go to Tech Georgia Tech? Oh. Okay. <SEP> Yeah. And I. I got a friend who goes there by the way. I want to as- talk to you about that afterward. Okay. <SEP> Okay. Uh I've. The high school I went to was uh was a good one also. And I well I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. Because the one I went to was you know I'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta. Yeah. Yeah. It was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system? <SEP> Yeah. Yes. That that was true for mine too. Uh although I I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity. But I don't think I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. You know I think that uh I mean I know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education. <SEP> What d-. And uh you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn. Yeah. That's true. I mean you know. <SEP> Yeah. And I'm also. I mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would you know in areas where they. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But but uh I think I mean even more than that even I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know? Which it I mean it sounds like uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. That's true. Now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory -tory tests if you have to take before you get a diploma. <SEP> Right. But uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read. Uh and that's just sort of inexcusable. And you can't really. I I I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know except maybe to someone who's you know really badly learning uh disabled or something. <SEP> Yeah. But these people obviously weren't. That's hard for me to say since I didn't I didn't really grow. <SEP> Well when I went to elementary school it it wasn't in a great area. But I still I mean I learned to read started learning to read when I was in kindergarten you know. Yeah. So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed region. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. You know I guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people. Yeah. And I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably. <SEP> I mean I don't I think you know people just. So I guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to uh to get some kind of motivation to learn. And. Yeah. And again I don't I mean. They got to know the you know how qualified I mean. I think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school. You know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think that'd be an interesting experience. But uh I haven't done that. No. I I can't say that I have either. <SEP> But uh. But I do I do think that uh I mean public education in general I think can work. And I think it's a good thing. Yeah. I've I've heard some I mean I've heard sta- sta- statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like within the same uh income groups. Yeah. <SEP> If you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private schools. Yes. I think they compare fair- you know fairly well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I don't I honestly don't really think I could have you know done much better than I did in the school system I was in. I mean. <SEP> Yeah. I I I my schools I mean there. I have a lot of. Once once it seemed I got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that. Yeah. <SEP> That I mean that makes a big difference. Cause I wondered when they're taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that. Yeah. I mean and and in the. Once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels. Well no. I guess it wa- in junior high it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects. Uh which. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean actually I think that works pretty well. And that that makes.
sw4792.txt:I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale California. Hi. This is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota. How you doing? Pretty good. <SEP> Good. Uh I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it. Yep. Uh I'm ready whenever you are. Okay. <SEP> So uh what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there? Well I definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's probably a good thing. It's probably the safest thing. <SEP> Yeah. I mean it's to easy to get a quorum. Yep. And simple majority won't do. No. And even like you know two-thirds majority I mean it's. <SEP> Yeah. That's. Yeah. Quorums are to easy to get. Yep. And there's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason you know. <SEP> So it's it's. Yeah. Definitely. But uh I don't know. I could I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing. Yeah. Like Gives them a little too much power. <SEP> Yeah. Tha-. I I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently. But uh. Plus you know you may be you know doing you know a a guilty verdict. But it may not be you know it may be for technical reasons. Yeah. About the only good thing I would say about that is it w- that it would uh hurry the process up a bit. Yeah. <SEP> But I mean even now we've got I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that. And that's what the trial by jury. I know. I mean jeez if if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances who's to say. Yeah. <SEP> It. There would be much more of that. Yeah. No doubt. Are you involved in the legal system at all? No. But I. I tend to follow it just to just to know what's going on. <SEP> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I've got some friends that are lawyers. So. Yeah. I do too. So. <SEP> One of them just got his law degree. But uh to tell you the truth I'm not real familiar with uh the system of juris- jurisprudence the way it is right now. No. I really haven't studied it in depth. Yeah. I know a little more about civil cases when than criminal cases. Which is. <SEP> Yeah. It's more in how you present it versus you know who's right. I'm sure of it. Because a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better. Yep. <SEP> Uh it's kind of weird. I don't know. You I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get. <SEP> I know. It's just. When I was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and. <SEP> Yeah. Like you know you go say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're going to you know. The opposition will say this this and this and. Uh-huh. And it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is. Yep. <SEP> It's pretty amazing. And it's like the the truth isn't really important anymore. It's. Yeah. It's not. And then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because. Yep. <SEP> Like this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious. And he really gets into suing people. And so he'll he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case you know. <SEP> It's like It is. It's it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. That sounds like a little abuse of our system. But. But uh. Yeah. But it's for the more general. People don't want to take responsibility. <SEP> Yeah. You know it's. And and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh and stuff. Yep. <SEP> See you're from California. Is that right? Uh yeah. Well originally from Chicago. But. Oh okay. I was just thinking. I wonder I wonder how how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis. I really. <SEP> From what I understand it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana. And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the. What is it. It's based on common law. And the rest of the country is not or something like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Pretty strange. But uh fortunately I never have had to go in even even for jury duty. Yeah. I haven't either other than. <SEP> But uh that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for uh as a witness. He may subpoena me. So we'll see what happens. But uh. Yeah. I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. <SEP> Yeah. It's. There are too many big problems you know. There's there's such a backlog of court cases right now. You know to try to get them all in in a good time. I know. And we already have too many lawyers as it is. Yeah. And if it's criminal cases we you can't put them in jail because there's no room left. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's true. And in fact they're even letting some go. Yeah. I I I'm originally from Florida. And it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them you know. Huh. <SEP> That's not a that's not a good solution either. Not at all. I'm not real sure what the.
sw4349.txt:The last auto repair I had was. I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck. I had a tune up done. And I had I had the brakes done on it. And then the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope. And it has eight spark plugs. And it's hard to to get get at them. And plus the time on them. I just don't have time any more. Uh as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself I I usually change the oil and wash the air filter. And I I had an occasion to change to have to change the battery once. But the brakes I was really surprised that the brakes. I wanted. I do have the background. I know what needs to be done. And I know that the oil needs should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings. And the lube lubrication system needs to be lubricated and. So I I stay on top of that. But I I wanted my front wheels. I wanted the bearings packed. And they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh a front or something like that. Or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it. Just to pack the bearings? Just to pack the bearings. But what I found is that they had a brake job. And they. I had them. The other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics. That's free. Okay. And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it see. <SEP> Right. And they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know. But still it was cheaper in the long run. And uh. So I just got the the brakes done. And I thought that was a good deal. And plus. Right. And they repacked the wheel bearings. And they re- repacked the the wheel bearings. Yeah. But uh I've I've had considerable experience. I'm you might say I'm uh uh good back yard mechanic. And I you know I took auto shop in high school. It's been a while back. But I I still have a pretty good feel for it. But one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars. I I had bigger cars. And the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those. And what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand I have almost one hundred and ten. So I drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty-five thousand miles. And there was hardly any wear to them. So those small little trucks and cars like that they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good. <SEP> You know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much. And the the surface materials on the pads is so good. Exa- Exactly. So I you know I just did it anyway. I like to I like to stay up on it. You know like I just kind of stay up on it. And then if you go and like just about any point any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say uh a white golden brown. You know it's not dirty. I I I keep it that way because that's that is the key to the longevity. <SEP> Right. Well it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that. So so how. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that. Oh. Oh. Uh I I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car. And uh and in fact I have an eighty-seven Mustang with a three O two in it that I've uh beefed up a little bit. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Okay. <SEP> And one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels. Uh-huh. Uh the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were uh not even cast aluminum. They were just pressed aluminum. You're talking about the vibration dampener? <SEP> Well there's three there's three pulleys that you change. You change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and uh the water pump pulley. That's the vibration dampener. Yeah. Okay. <SEP> So when I changed those over I put on these these pressed aluminum things. Um. And uh probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out. Uh oh. <SEP> So in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way. But not far enough to notice. Um. Uh oh. <SEP> Huh. So I was on my way to work one day. And uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half. <SEP> So there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump. And the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank. Uh-huh. And uh I.
sw4928.txt:Well my exercise program consists of uh you know. It's it's a opportunity to stay alive really. Instead of you know wasting my my the you know the trying to exist on the latency of my youth the good health of my youth. Huh. I'm. And what I like to do is I like to stretch out. And I like to run uh m-. I'm I like to run get my heartbeat up. I like to run about oh about two two and a half miles. And then I like to work out on uh on the uh the Bailey Life C- Cycle machines up here at the at the Holiday Spa. And and I I think that you know. I've had a regiment now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that. And uh and I I kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work. But I think it's uh it's a lot of work. But I think it's uh it's the uh the amount of effort that's required to uh to stay healthy you know. I have a sedentary job. And uh unless you do something like that y- you're going to get sick. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I'm I need to get. I'm I'm pretty bad about that. I'm lazy. I should I know. I want I always say that I need to get run- start running. And I'm going to try and do that this summer. Because I never have time. I I always put it off. By the time I get back from classes it's late at night. And I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever. Because I'm I'm getting a gut here. I got to get back into shape. Well I uh two years ago I started having trouble with my knee. And uh you know I've got you know. I figured well it'll go away. Well I s- you know I'm I've had to reduce my program reduce my program. And I've gained fifteen pounds. Huh. And so uh you know it's e- you know. I need to get back into swimming you know instead of running. If I can't swim or I can't run I should be able to swim. Well I'm such a terrible swimmer. And I I I really feel I can I can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes f- to this effort. But if it gets longer than that I I i- it I start not doing anything. <SEP> Yeah. And so so I got a real problem in that regard. Uh it. Do. You obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it. Yeah. I mean I do it I guess. I'm going to do it uh because I want to get in shape. I'm not it's not something I really enjoy all that much that I'll I'll probably. I mean once I get into it and I if I if I get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a a chore to me. Well it's it's always a chore. I mean I started doing this when I was about thirty-five. <SEP> Yeah. Huh. And now I'm fifty-five. <SEP> Yeah. And uh you know I I know that in I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense. Y- you know some health related thing is going to blow me away. That's the same way. I got too much weight on right now. I need to lose fifty pounds you know. Right. I need to lose at least twenty you know. But uh you know it's it's just uh I'm busy. I'm doing a lot of traveling. And uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road. What sort of uh uh what other programs other than say running? Have you have you ever done anything at all? <SEP> Yeah. I have. Uh sit-ups. Or al- also last summer I was doing Nautilus. Or last year I'm uh belong to a club right here. Got kind of expensive uh to r- to r- renew. They wanted another fifty dollars. Uh-huh. That was a little bit too much money. But uh doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that. Club what club are you with? <SEP> I'm sorry? What club were you with? It's called oh what was it called. City Sports downtown Washington. Oh. Okay. So you're you're down you're downtown. <SEP> Yeah. I'm at I'm at I go to George Washington University. Okay. Yeah. You're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and F G. Yeah. <SEP> It's uh Plaza. Oh. Well I'd uh. Well there's a there's a Holiday Spa down there on on K street I think. Something like that. But uh I I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria. And that's pretty good. But you know evening time it gets pretty busy. But generally you know I can I can get in and get a program you know. Right. But uh you know I I need to I need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this. And uh I got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it. I mean I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years. <SEP> Yeah. And you know and I'm I know I'm going to get I know it's going to bite me in the ass. And so I I really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it. Yeah. It's something. I think uh I'm young. I should get started getting into shape. I don't want to. I want. I mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it. Well no. When you're young you you can abuse your your all your systems. <SEP> And you can recover. Yeah. Uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away. And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye you know. <SEP> Huh. And uh and so the object.
sw4333.txt:Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them. Or or or what do you think? Well that's that's a really hard question. I do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths. Uh I. Let's example uh. Our friend the President right now says no new taxes. We should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession. And at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases. So uh I know the politicians uh aren't aren't straightforward. Now i- in terms of economics I'm not. It's hard hard to call. It really is. Uh-huh. See I never thought really it's uh I never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little. I I always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment. For instance like Social Security tax or Soc- uh. I mean that's that's tax. We're paying money. And and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us. <SEP> Right. So that's. Yeah you know. When I when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week I or each every other week I I really think that money's history. And you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing. Yes uh. And we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back. Uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio which. I may be wrong. But I believe that the cure for polio is already founded. But but supposedly once you have an office in D C or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down. And and they just haven't yet. <SEP> Well yeah. I'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular. I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio. Uh-huh. I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. Well that might be the difference. I don't know. Uh the other thing that uh I remember seeing on T V lately is uh had to do with. It's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically. <SEP> Right. That that histor- for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians. Yeah. It's it's it's funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh c- congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals. Uh-huh. <SEP> And the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing. So it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto. Oh. <SEP> I I think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste. On the other hand uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. Uh and just to get rid of the unimportant things. Yeah. And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exa- where the boundary between waste and and necessity is. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I'm not I'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems. But there definitely is is a problem with. Uh I forgot. There's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something. Yeah. Uh. Pork barrel politics. <SEP> Pork barrel politics. The- the- there has to be some way to do it. I know state governors usually have line item vetos. And uh I lived in Massachusetts for a while. And uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. Yeah. But Massachusetts wasn't when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially. D-. At least at the end. Uh-huh. I mean I don't know. I. <SEP> Yeah. I- i- they were very good at first. They were in very good financials at first. And uh that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well. And then of course the bottom fell out. It's uh I mean it's it's tough. I mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations. I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot. Or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot. And spare the economy. Yeah. It's really it's a hard balance. It it definitely is. Even not for government even just say for a small business. Uh I know some.
sw4720.txt:Uh I think uh actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation. And for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit. Right. I think it's health care. It's what. I think everybody would say that. <SEP> Oh and if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg. Right. Belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you. Right. Uh so- the uh. Sometimes I think it's more important than salary. <SEP> Uh do you also get dental? Yes. And uh I don't know if I would rank that second. But uh since I have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important. Yeah. You know. Oh I know. In a in a given year dental ca- dental expenses can really kill you. <SEP> Now my husband is with uh Northwest Airlines. And he gets uh you know the full health and dental. And uh we have four children. And what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous. Right. And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it. Right. It's uh. <SEP> Or maybe they don't. Right. Uh and then uh uh if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will. That's right. That's right. Uh I guess that would be up there. Uh I'm not sure if I would rank uh how I would rank that next to say compared to retirement. Or uh uh uh pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great a great benefit. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. And I I think it's really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan. Uh. <SEP> Right. Well it's a lot easier to to save it when you don't get your hands on it first. Right. When you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive. And if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldn't otherwise do. <SEP> Right. And. Uh what about what about uh lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the corporation. For example uh oh. Leave? <SEP> Yeah. Do they e- even do they have father leaves or anything like that? You know I I don't think so yet. They may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I their uh I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short. Uh. Oh I do too. Uh uh I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks. <SEP> Oh I think I think it's just a crying shame uh for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks. Right. And uh. <SEP> She isn't recovered. And uh the infant needs her desperately at that point and time. There. <SEP> There ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. I agree. It's uh it's so important to families then. And uh and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up. Oh sure. Uh. <SEP> Especially in this day and age. That. You don't want to start over again anywhere. Yeah. You're right. I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I that I would most like to see uh changed. Uh the uh parental leave. <SEP> Well I think they're at they're com- they've come a long way. Uh at least some companies. Some of them uh my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency. Right. And uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy. And uh I just don't know how how women do it. Particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end. Uh. Right. They do it by shortchanging their kids. There's no other way. I mean uh unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely. Uh. <SEP> That's right. That's exactly right. Right. People moving as much. And uh they just it's just a terrible choice. You shouldn't have to make it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh you're right. And uh. <SEP> One of the benefits we get of course is travel. Oh right. Boy. Would I like to have that. It's wonderful. Yeah. <SEP> The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere. But you can't afford to stay once you get there. Oh listen I have friends in a lot of different cities. If you just fly me there. I'll take care of that. That's right. You have to have an awful lot of fun. Just just getting there is has to be half the fun. Right. <SEP> So and uh I guess the.
sw4603.txt:Okay. Go ahead. Uh well you know uh I think public service is a worthy thing. And as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs uh such as Peace Corps that promote that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Probably the most popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts. Huh. Uh I know that f- because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his Eagle. And uh in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in uh citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world. Right. <SEP> And you have to do a public service project. Uh in which leadership is the key element. Uh-huh. I uh I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because uh it's talking about a requirement for public service. Uh-huh. <SEP> And of course Pe- the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a o- is a voluntary activity. Right. Uh. I I think that might be talking referring to uh something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know. Either you have uh military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years. <SEP> Right. Of course uh uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service. Right. Right. And so uh one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal uh qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft. Huh. Right. Right. <SEP> Uh. But I agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended. There are other things such as civil service uh which many people uh are lifelong employees of. Well i-. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But I suspect that was not what they had in mind either. More of a voluntary kind of thing. Yeah. <SEP> Or uh. Yeah. Yeah. I- i-. For for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school. Uh-huh. Uh kind of in lieu of the draft for for people who don't uh who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want e- e- to be in the military you know. Say okay. Well you can go into the military. Or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and learn about things. And i- it's interesting because I I'm not a particular fan of the military. But I have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know even just personal discipline about what they want to do. And they come out. And they they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline. And they have uh you know in in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that you know if I do something or sub- submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time I can accomplish a lot. And it it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn. That they don't need to be you know cowboys. They don't need to be out there and uh you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished. <SEP> And you know for some for some young men that's good. For me it would have been lousy i- idea uh because I I did have th- the personal discipline. Why? And I went to college for four years and got out you know. <SEP> Why is that? So. But uh you know for some people that's good. I I don't particular like the fact that it's the military you know. And the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially. As as an instrument of U S policy. Oh no. No. No. It's to defend the nation against external evils. Well that's one view. And and you know and that that's another debate. But uh it's uh. <SEP> Well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military. Uh-huh. Right. Right. And well it's it it seems pretty aggre- aggressive oriented. I mean you you look at the last mis- military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States. And it was uh you know it was definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe. So at at any rate this is getting off the topic. But i-. My my point was that there is for people who don't want to do the military service there it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and uh sense of community that the Boy Scouts.
sw4619.txt:Bye. So we're uh our discussion's about uh the care of the elderly? That's right. That's right. You know what what uh what do you think is important? If you were. Uh I don't know how how old you are. But if you had if you had uh parents say or or or th- grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for? <SEP> Uh well I actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety. And he lives by himself. Huh. And he's in good shape. <SEP> Yeah. Uh but uh some friends of mine have uh gone through this. I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and uh where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive. And where there was uh caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it. Yeah. Do you have any experience with this yourself? <SEP> Huh. Well my uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh Minnesota. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we go there uh once a year. We see we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston. So we're pretty far away. When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her. Uh-huh. And it seems uh. I mean the the environment there I don't know too much about it. But it it seems nice enough. Uh it it's hard. At least half of the residents I would say are not not mentally sound. So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r- to retain uh clarity say uh you know. From the lack of stimulation you mean. <SEP> Yeah. Well I I don- I don't know. We we also my wife and I uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house. We uh she goes more often than I. We used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there. And we'd take we have a two year old son. And so we sometimes we'd take him with us. And uh there I would say it's the same thing. It's it's a nice uh relatively nice environment. But again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just e- e- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly uh certainly have ar- ar- are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on. It's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see an- and see all these other people who really don't know where they are. Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern? I think yeah. I think they're relatively re- respectful. Yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be. I I think sometimes you know I've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and but things that are not reasonable. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so at some level the the the uh. Yeah. I'm sure that the that the uh the staff l- learn what's normal for this person. And so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know. Yeah. It it's possible. I was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you one thing though that'll that that I I saw that was really nice. We saw a husband and wife. We used to see a husband and wife in there uh together. And they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were. But these two were. Uh-huh. <SEP> And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house. Uh-huh. So it gives them a sense of identity. And so. <SEP> Yeah. You walked in there. And it didn't look like uh you know how yo- you you walk into some rooms. And there's it's completely generic. There's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person. And that's it. But this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that. And they had all their stuff from their house. And it looked like uh i- i- it must have been. It was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them. And it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know s- s- uh. Yeah. I I think part of what you're saying matches what I h- have read. I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who uh were adequately deficient in their abilities uh physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves. Yeah. But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide um a lot of social activities. <SEP> Huh. Yeah. Uh the one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities. And she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation. Uh and. Huh. Temporary. I. That that's that's new to me. I. Well I think it I think t- it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there. And I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there. <SEP> Right. Right. And there there's so much.
sw4633.txt:How many children do you have now? Well I have five. You have five? <SEP> Right. Well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you? Well five are I mean four of them are grown. They're in college or just out of college. So I really have just a thirteen year old at home. Uh-huh. You sound so young. <SEP> Well I work at it. All right. To have them uh. I try to fool everybody. I think you're doing a good job. <SEP> I just have one child. Uh-huh. And uh I don't think uh. Well there's not much I can do about it. My my wife and I are u- in our forties you know. So uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the they're the pivot point of the universe. I think you are right. Because I was an only child too. And that's one reason I have so many because I really I enjoy the big family. Yeah. <SEP> And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters. And so she is sort of like an only child. And it's the same type of thing uh. Uh-huh. I have a younger brother like that. I'm in my forties like I say. And I have a brother in his twenties. Uh-huh. And I was I was the youngest. <SEP> Yeah. So I understand how that worked. And he was treated like he had five fathers or something. Right. That's exactly how it is you know. She's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her. When things don't go right she just calls one of them you know. Yeah. <SEP> But uh yeah. It it's a little bit difficult though. I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more. And. Did you all do a lot of organized things like uh Little League uh soccer? We we really did not. My next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion. She twirls a baton. And we did a lot of things together. Uh-huh. <SEP> She and I did a lot of things together and flew. We have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform. Uh-huh. And that was a lot of fun. But that that I guess you could consider that organized. I mean there is a competition all the time. Yeah. <SEP> We were very heavy into that. Other than that they were pretty much. And maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that. You know I think that's probably true. The. If you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities. Uh-huh. And if you have a large number of children or then you don't. <SEP> Well you can't afford to. No. You ca-. And there's not enough time uh. Right. Like my son is in uh Little League this year. He's ten. And they practice three times a week. And they have a game. And it's just uh if there were more than one child I don't know the- there would be no way to do it. <SEP> Right. That's right. You know one parent go one direction. And I'd have to go in the other. And we could only cover two at that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Well I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter. And my little one also competed because really she had no choice. She had to go with me. Uh-huh. So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing. And of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was. It was making the friends and going all the places. And it was a really neat experience. But it took our total time. I did not work uh when I did this. Now I do work full-time. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's just my thirteen year old and myself. And so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other. So. I don't think although i- i-. I think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me. But I'm not sure I could afford three. I most certainly couldn't educate three. <SEP> I don't know how my my parents did it. Yeah. I mean there were five of us. And I don't recall you know wanting anything in particular. Uh but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line. And he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and. But now my wife and I both work. And we don't I don't believe we have as much as my parents did. And we only have one child. <SEP> Really? Uh-huh. Well things cost a lot more. I don't know how it is in Georgia. Huh. <SEP> And I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some. Atlanta is horrible. Is it? Yes. Ha- we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and and different areas. And from talking to them they're shocked. <SEP> Really? Wha-. And they you know. The housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it. Right. <SEP> That's what I've heard. They sell their house. They stash away a good bit of money and come down here. And I work with a lot of them. They they think they they have really done something. Then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to to where they came from. Huh. <SEP> Yeah. The housing is cheaper. But that's about it. I'm surprised to hear that. I've heard very positive things about Atlanta.
sw4320.txt:Okay. So how serious is the subject of crime in your area? <SEP> Well needless to say here in Washington D C this is the war zone. Uh D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital. It's uh it's really bad here. Uh for example the uh local high school uh they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns. <SEP> Jeez. And they're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things. So. Well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime. Uh-huh. Uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns. Uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the Hispanic core. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions. Uh-huh. Right. That's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups I guess. And uh. <SEP> Yeah. Now the. Interestingly enough I don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few. Most of them centered around uh drug territory. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so they're protecting their economic interests I guess. Yeah. And uh nowadays the latest thing I've I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up. And then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house. <SEP> Well that's efficient. Yeah. That's the uh latest thing. That way there's no damage to the car or anything. They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want. They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Just wait for you to drive to your house. You get out. And they get in. Off they go with your car. <SEP> Wow. So it's. Uh I think they call it car jacking around here. Yeah. Yeah. I'd heard that phrase. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's kind of the latest thing. But every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides. So it's uh it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here. We're from uh I'm from Ohio. And my wife's from Florida. So. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we've just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment. So this is a whole new thing for for us to to have to put up with. And it's uh really scary sometimes. Yeah. There aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays. <SEP> Right. And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school. Uh-huh. And uh of course the mayor uh of D C is having a real problem uh trying to. What do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody. It's uh I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem. I don't know what what the solution is. Uh there's no way they can stop the drugs. And that's what's causing all the killing. <SEP> Well uh there's a couple of things that I've heard. Uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you'd have to do. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh course the the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else s- seems to be just you know the the the end results of of poverty and and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else. Uh-huh. <SEP> Because I mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything. Right. Uh. And they see all their friends and neighbors uh. <SEP> And they're accidental parents half the time anyway. Yeah. And their friends are driving Mercedes. And so it's actually. They grow up with that as their way of life. And uh I think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised. It's illegal. But it's not wrong because all their friends do it. Right. Exactly. So maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes. And they they say well it's it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life. <SEP> Yeah. So I don't know. It's. I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy. Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem. Uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. The the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away. Right. <SEP> Uh. They've always been with us. I mean there's there's been a lot of uh. And I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus. But then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow. Right. <SEP>
sw4733.txt:Think about this? Uh do you have children in school? I do. <SEP> Uh I have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college. Uh. But I also have two that are just entering school. Uh Uh well I think they're just pushing them mu- entirely to fast. So you see a big difference then in before and now do you. <SEP> Or. A lot of testing? <SEP> Uh well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade. Uh-huh. My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner. I do too. I oh I think that's awful. And uh I have a preschooler. Uh I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten. And I thought well how mature do you have to be. I know. What's the new criteria huh. <SEP> And uh there is a. Do you have the standardized testing now? We have all kinds of testing. And it's over and over. It's I T B S or and uh just everything everything. Yeah. And they test test test. I live in Plano actually. And I don't know if you've heard of Plano. But it's a very transient community. <SEP> No. A lot of people from everywhere. It's just north of Dallas. Uh-huh. And it's grown in leaps and bounds. I we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now. <SEP> Oh. And most of them from other places. Yeah. Uh J C Penney's come down from New York and of course T I and Xerox from Rochester. And we just have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in. <SEP> Yeah. <SEP> And it's a very wealthy community. Uh not that I am. But other people seem to be. And I would love to know why. But I mean they do. They have. <SEP> You would like to know what they're doing right. I I would. I really would. I mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes. And they have everything. The kids only wear name brand things to school. And it's one of these things. Oh me. Well that makes it hard for you doesn't it. Well it does you know. It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now. And uh you know it does. <SEP> Oh me. I mean we do it to a point. But uh not to where she feels different. <SEP> Yeah. But some of them are very rich. It's hard to explain to them why you can't. And so uh we just kind of have everything here. <SEP> And we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are. Right. And so I don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas. <SEP> But the kids are expected to excel in everything. <SEP> Oh dear. And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first. And they're expected to be. Right. You know their parents expect it. The teachers expect it. Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system. <SEP> Right. And if you read national surveys they're far from it. And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests. How about the kids. How are they coping with it? Well not very well. They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests. <SEP> Huh. Right. I mean they make a big deal. To me the paper should just be put on the desk that day. And say just do this. <SEP> You know I just feel they do better that way. Yeah. Rather than anticipating. And. <SEP> Yeah. And and I have older children too that now are out of high school. And they've always done this here. I mean it's always been the same. But it is it's getting worse and worse. Is more pressure for everything. And I just think it's really awful. And I I'm with you on that. You don't hear too many people say this. But I think it's a very long day. Oh it is. And my feeling is that you know you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school. <SEP> That's right. My son said that came home. And he said he said Mom all we do is work. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> We hardly ever play. And. And I don't think that's right. I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. Oh likewise. I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano. <SEP> Right. I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids. Wouldn't that be great. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. And so I just find this a real problem. I think if they're going to be there all day they should find time. One of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was. And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week. And when she went back in six weeks she was ahead. So what does that tell you? <SEP> Is that right? It tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time. Oh my gosh. <SEP> Oh my gosh. And they could be using this time better. Well for example in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time. After lunch they have some uh. I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch. And then they have naps or rest period. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting. That's a very long day for kindergartners. I agree. But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this. <SEP> I wouldn't be surprised. You know because they don't they don't want to send them to daycare. I doubt if they would say it was too long. That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day. <SEP> Uh do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care? We have them at one school like.
sw4812.txt:So how do you feel about it? Uh I I don't see any problem with with testing for random drugs. Yeah. I I myself almost uh am in favor of it. Uh I work at Honeywell. And I went through a a pretty I don't know I went through a standard drug testing thing before I I was brought on. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think that's pretty standard. At least at Honeywell it is. Uh I think it's important to insure the quality and and uh I don't know almost the goodness of character. You know that kind of thing. Yeah. Where do you work? <SEP> Uh well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon. Oh okay. Oh okay. And I I just came from Saint Paul. Uh interviewing with Three M. Huh. <SEP> Oh great. And uh they have a policy for uh testing. If you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start. Right. <SEP> And I guess the only drawback I can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> But i-. Yeah. And that that definitely happens you know. I mean those the drug tests sure they're accurate. But there's always that margin of error. Yeah. And that's that's something to be aware of. Another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate. They aren't that sensitive. Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that. <SEP> Yeah. You know I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell. And uh uh you know I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something. Uh I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types. Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this. And then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for. Right. Uh I don't know. What what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon? <SEP> Uh electrical engineering. Oh okay. Great. Uh yeah. I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida. Oh wow. And this is actually a an internship up here. <SEP> But uh they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing. So. They test you uh before they before you start or before you even interview. Right. <SEP> Or. Uh they essentially. No. I sure don't uh. They essentially uh they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that. So uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests. And and then they essentially give you the offer. Uh-huh. And then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that. <SEP> Oh. So uh there's some noise on this end. I'm actually in a mall calling. So. Oh. You probably wondered huh. But. <SEP> Yeah. Wh- what happens if you were to fail? Then do they give you like one ch- one more chance or two more chances? Yes. That's a good question. I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail I believe they give you one more chance. They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it. Uh-huh. But uh you know once again those things are not that accurate. So there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know. But uh wha-. Are you working right now anywhere. Or. <SEP> Uh no. Okay. I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and uh just interviewing with companies right now. Oh okay. Great. <SEP> Yeah. That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know. Was was going to Honeywell. A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there. Uh-huh. And he's doing an internship with I B M. <SEP> Oh. And uh they basically uh did the same exact thing. Uh we both got our internships at the same time. And we both had to go through drug testing at the same time. So one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process. But uh. Did do they test you at right now at work too? No. No. That's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job. <SEP> Okay. Uh I think I think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it. But they don't do it. Oh. You know so. That's good I guess. I don't know. I mean I uh I have gone to a couple of parties since since that time. And while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there uh you know smoking a joint or whatever. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know. But no. They don't they don't really do that. So. Wow. Is it formal policy that they said they might test? Yeah.
sw4880.txt:Okay. Well uh I'll let you start I guess. Well uh yeah. I I'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing. And I've got some very definite uh opinions about it. Uh you know which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it. But uh developed a little more I guess but haven't changed that much. What about you? Are you uh in- involved at all? Uh no. I mean I'm not. My employer does not do that. Uh although uh I had an ex-employer that. Uh the previous job I used to have uh they. After I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test. <SEP> Yes. Uh I I don't know. My feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb uh if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I I'd be willing to support that. For example uh uh well uh uh train engineers. Yeah. Because it you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer you know. <SEP> Right. He crashed and killed some people because he was uh smoking some marijuana. And I guess air traffic controllers. I wouldn't want them to be on drugs. And airplane pilots. But where it's not necessary uh in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh I I'd I would seriously question it. Yeah. Uh so. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It uh that's that's mine. It it you know. I I go back. It to me no matter how much the th- our company claims it's not a constitutional issue. That because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government. It's not. The Constitution doesn't apply. But I it it seems to me that it still should. I I our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor. Uh and so it's it's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts. And I'd I'd. So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent? Yes. Okay. An- and our company has taken that and gone all the way. Say. Okay uh. First off we don't we don't have enough courage to uh pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage uh because that would offend them uh if they if they weren't. So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even. <SEP> Uh and and uh. Yeah. Well i-. <SEP> Then uh. But and they. So it's a a complete random testing. W- well it's random in the sense that you don't know when. It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested. Huh. Uh and uh you know I I sit at a terminal and and write software all day. It it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in in my job. Right. And. <SEP> And and uh yes. I I agree that there are there are uh jobs that are definitely life threatening. And and and th- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at rea- reasonable and proper. I- you know. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I mean it's well there's also the issue of uh. O- o- out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of. There was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results. O- or I shouldn't say high. Well. I mean several percent. <SEP> Yeah. I that that I that I will give credit to to our our company for in that that I think there's there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh of drugs. And e- e- essentially the first thing is t- is on the order of paper in the urine and uh or some you know. It's not quite that simple. But it's fairly simple. Kind of a coarse kind of test. Coarse kind of test. And then there's a a much more uh uh refined test uh uh spectrography or whatever it's called. The chemo- chemotography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are. Is that done. <SEP> Right. And uh. Now l- let me ask you this. Uh e- e- at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any. <SEP> No. I I've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now. Okay. So that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this. And uh. <SEP> No. And it and it and it has it has you know. They did that three or four years before they did it with everybody. And I uh at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know. But on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test.
sw4342.txt:So how do you uh. So so it sounds like you've got a television going on there. So I can assume that you probably watch the T V news. Is that. I almost never watch T V news. Really? <SEP> Wow. I. I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio. Uh what what station do you listen to? <SEP> Uh it's a local radio station. It's called uh K L I F cliff. Cliff I see. So uh it's not affiliated with anything is it. Not it's not a network station. No. <SEP> No. Okay. Yeah. Because I I listen to uh public radio a lot. And they have they have K C R W which I I I saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet I guess. They're getting a little getting a little feisty now. Well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news. Uh. <SEP> And occasionally in the morning I'll pick up something like uh C N N or that. But I hate watching the like ten o'clock news. Or. Yeah. So you have a paper or something or. Yeah. We have a lo- well we have uh DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas. Uh-huh. <SEP> We read I read it pretty much from cover to cover. Yeah. How do you like it? It's been it's been a while since I read the Dallas news. I uh fact last time I read the Dallas Dallas news I was in Arkansas. <SEP> I uh. The TIMES HERALD went out of business here. Oh yeah? <SEP> And so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper. Well that must be pretty bad. So how did that happen anyway? <SEP> Uh financial trouble. No. Not how. I mean when did it when did they. Oh when did it happen? Yeah. <SEP> I guess they closed down about three months ago. Oh really. Um. <SEP> So how do you keep up? Oh me I uh good grief I read the TIMES LOS ANGELES TIMES. There's quite a task if you've ever run into one. They're uh speci-. Yes they're very voluminous. <SEP> Yeah. They're thick. Uh if there's something you want to know it's it's in the TIMES and then and in detail. Uh they uh we we used to have two papers here in town. And then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of oh I don't know just nobody was buying it really. <SEP> So there really is only one major L A now? Yeah. Pretty much. Uh there used to be fact I think there still is the uh the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley. And uh they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes. In fact it was kind of weird because I met the uh I met the I met the editor uh while I was on uh while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time. It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff. He was a really cool guy. Uh you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff. And uh it's it's a pretty good paper. But uh you know it's not it's not the TIMES. <SEP> Yeah. Although I you know I'm sorry to see some of their uh. There's there's a daily news uh news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're they're expanding I guess. But uh a- and occasionally I I pick up like TIME magazine or something I think uh if they've got an interesting lead story. But you know it's. I I don't have time. I used to read TIME magazine a lot. But I don't read it much anymore. Yeah. That's that's kind of a problem for them. There's a lot of people who fall into that category. <SEP> And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community. Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. Uh-huh. <SEP> I see. Yeah. The big dailies don't like to don't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf. I have to admit the TIMES is kind of provincial too. It's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover. <SEP> Now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section. Uh-huh. And it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano. But it's still not an awful lot of news. Yeah. I know. I uh it was it was a big discovery when when the TIMES when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County. <SEP> I mean the way they I mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border. Oh I would imagine in uh you know in in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the sub- suburbs. And of course they tend to cover the county. And we're not in Dallas county. So they tend to ignore places outside of the county. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I I I find that attitude kind of arrogant though. It's like you're taking our money. But you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us. Yeah.
sw4688.txt:Well we in in in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances. Uh the uh way back what twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer I did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all this kind of thing. And we kept that going for about a month. And it became so onerous that we gave up on it. Uh-huh. That sounds about right. You know so uh the only thing we're you know that we do now is uh I keep a a little spread sheet of uh what I call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth. Uh and I only update that oh I don't know maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just basically when the statements come in. You know. Just to see whether or not we're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Uh that's really about you know the extent of uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that we're doing. <SEP> Uh. Well it's kind of difficult for me. Because right now uh like most teachers I'm laid off. And. Huh. Oh dear that's terrible. <SEP> So um I spend most you know. I substitute a lot. Uh-huh. So it's a lot it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances. Uh-huh. <SEP> And but I know how much I have to bring in a month. And that's about it. That's about as far as we go. And then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us. And just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day. Uh-huh. Oh I see. Are you are you married? Are you living with a bunch of with with people that you're sharing expenses? <SEP> Uh no. I'm a single mother. I have three children. Oh I see. Uh-huh. So uh right now we're on we get f- you know aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it. And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support. Oh dear. <SEP> So right now I know what I'm getting from the state. And uh I have to balance more or less what I get from the state with my bills and uh you know try to work as many days as possible. Any time they call me in. Uh-huh. But I still have to figure out. If I work too many days then I lose all my state aid. And if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills. And it's like a juggling act every single month. Uh-huh. <SEP> Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in. But they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation. I see. So you know the four days before they only have a four day week. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in. A- oh I see. They don't like to be absent before a vacation. Oh sure. <SEP> But we're shopping around as far as well I'm shopping around as far as trying to get uh that's why I'm doing this to get some extra money. And uh getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. Uh-huh. My kids are in Boy Scouts. So trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. Because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me. So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit. But you know we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I guess we're in the situation that a lot of am- middle-class Americans are in. Uh-huh. Yeah. You're the first you know uh. My next door neighbor just lost his job. In a you know one of these uh. <SEP> Oh my Lord. His company went broke. I mean went you know bankrupt. Actually it was a subsidiary of a of an outfit called U S Shoe or something. I- i- it was a computer subsidiary. I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company. Really. But uh you know they just folded it up and uh uh told him to. They took the top management and gave them jobs with the with the corporate uh at the corporate front office. <SEP> Uh-huh. And everybody else was sent packing. Oh. Uh hang on one second. I've got. <SEP> Sure. Uh somebody was knocking on my door here. Uh it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present. I mean it sounds sounds terrible to say. But at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than most people probably ar- might be. In terms of keeping keeping score of input and output. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Definitely. Do you have do you have a computer at home. Or. Uh yes. We do. And we try to. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know I keep track of every penny. And more or less enter it in. Uh-huh. Every single day I'm at the computer. I see. <SEP> And it's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Have you do you use a standard uh a standard spread sheet. Or I mean.
sw4360.txt:Uh let's see. How about uh let's see about ten years ago. Uh what do you think was different ten years ago from now? Well I would say as far as social changes go uh I think families were more together. They they did more things together. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh they ate dinner at the table together. Uh the parents usually took out time uh you know more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity. Uh-huh. Uh although I'm not a mother I I still think that uh a lot has changed since ten years ago. Uh what do you think about that? We. <SEP> Well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short. Yeah. Uh but I do agree that uh generally it's society has sort of uh let's see rushed everything ahead. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I don't know. It leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that. In other words they just prioritize their lives differently. But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation. Yes. What about like as far as uh social changes in the individual? Do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago? Uh. <SEP> Um. It depends. Uh it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too. Uh-huh. Uh I just. <SEP> Well how how old are you? I'm twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. Okay. I'm twenty-three. Yeah. <SEP> So there's maybe a five year gap between us. Yeah. So uh. I just I think that things were a bit were have been busy all along. It's just a matter where priorities are at placed. And that uh usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home. <SEP> Huh. Yes. <SEP> Uh-huh. And now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work. Do you think it's an economic c- necessity. Or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living? I think that's part of it too. But I do think. <SEP> I mean do you think people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs or. No. No. I don't. <SEP> No. I don't think that. But then there are a lot of people that that don't have that. But that really do need to work. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive. And then there th- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that uh they think is is surviving which is really more luxuries. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Okay. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh but I I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive. Yo- so you think it's. Which group are you saying is the one trying? I'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living. <SEP> Uh-huh. Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing uh middle class in this country I think that that's in my opinion the case. Uh-huh. <SEP> Okay. So. I mean I have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job. Okay. And then sometimes I I often uh find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. Yo- a microwave a V C R a answering machine a you know a special a dishwasher uh a refrigerator and some of those items um for the for the uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well I guess we're sticking more to social changes. But uh people want all of that. Uh-huh. And not all of those are necessities. Right. <SEP> So they're trying to. It has become a necessity.
sw4483.txt:Uh anyway we're supposed to talk about recycling. Basically what what your personal opinion is on it. Uh this is this is really for a speech research project they're doing. So uh I don't know. Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it? Well they just kicked it off down here in in Sarasota county. Oh they did? <SEP> Uh they had been doing it. They started first in Sarasota City. Uh you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> And uh they've got these I don't know what if you're familiar with Sarasota county at all. Not quite. No. They've got these wh-. It's it's county wide program now. Uh-huh. <SEP> And what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage. Uh yard trash. Plastic cr- cans and glass. And then uh paper. Uh-huh. Okay. <SEP> Okay. Which in the paper it's just uh newspaper and corrugated cardboard. Is the only thing you're supposed to put in there. Yeah. <SEP> Okay. No slicks. Uh. Oh that's that's good. Let me ask you this. Do they require you to presort it? <SEP> Yeah. Okay. See that's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on. In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly. But when I lived in Orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there. Uh-huh. And they'd just sort it out for you. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am. So. Yeah. Right. Well you know uh I talked to this girl. Who uh she's a an s- an acquaintance of mine. And and she's involved with uh oh. What is the name of that company. It's not Amway. But it's the other big vitamin company? Shaklee. Oh okay. Yeah. <SEP> Okay. And uh and and she's just Shaklee crazy you know because it's her business and everything. And uh you know and she asked. We were talking one day. And and she asked me a couple of questions you know. And she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they don't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything. Yeah. <SEP> Which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know. Right. I mean it's a little extra work. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in Sarasota county is they've got. It can. Yeah. Okay. You put your garbage in a garbage bag. And you set it out by the curb. Right. <SEP> If you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container. Uh or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and cer- certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb. Yeah. You got to tie them up and everything. Well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub. And it's about a foot and a half deep. And it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long. Right. <SEP> This is a little container. Uh-huh. And then they have another one the same size. That one's red. Then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so like you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans. Otherwise you got bees and ants. And you know and and if you've got uh food containers or anything like that it's a big problem. Exactly. It is you know a big hassle. <SEP> So not only do you. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. I mean up here they give you one one of those containers. And you put everything in it. <SEP> Uh-huh. So it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you. It's like well you know if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to p- to put all your recyclables in that one place you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> This is true. So it's kind of a pain in the butt. This is true. But uh I don't know. That's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know. You have have those garbage people that make how every many make tw- twenty thirty bucks an hour. Have them do a little bit of the sorting. You know. And and maybe come up with a better system. <SEP> Uh-huh. Make it a little more convenient. But. Yeah. They've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here. Uh if you want to have a nice garbage can you know. Yeah. <SEP> And it's on wheels. And it's big. Oh you can actually rent those? Yeah. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Up here the the city provides them. Kind of like. I think in I think in the city they do. But out here in the county you have to rent them. Oh okay. <SEP> And they just add it on to your water bill or something. So where exactly are you in terms of of like Sarasota? Are you north of Sarasota or East. East of Sarasota. Okay. <SEP> Uh-huh. And Sarasota is on the west coast? Yeah. Okay. Like south of Tampa right? <SEP> Yeah. Okay. I'm. Yeah. About an hour. About an hour south of Tampa. Yeah. That's. <SEP> Okay. Uh yeah. Well. I listen to this talk radio station down here. And it's really. Th- they. I don't if you ever listen to talk radio. But those guys they just kind of get into to s- s- stewing up trouble you know. With the callers and things like that. Um occasionally. <SEP> Yeah. But they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know. And some of it sometimes it's serious. And they have some good feedback and all that stuff. And from listening to that I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with. Yeah. <SEP> And this kind of fits into the uh the aid program. The welfare program that's going on right now. Uh-huh. And it's like uh.
sw4858.txt:Uh I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't. And uh I guess uh looking back on it I tend to think it was pretty uh mostly a mistake. Uh-huh. On the other hand uh the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental uh decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh but on the whole I think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do. How about you? Well I'm uh I I was just uh in high school I guess when it when it ended. Uh-huh. <SEP> Ended up being. I was in the last last lottery. Yeah. And I was glad it was over by then. Right. <SEP> I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there. Just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like. Yeah. You know we uh. Those people that I know. I work with several that were over there. And for some of them it was just kind of I don't know not so much a holiday. I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods. And ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles. And then they'd come back. <SEP> And you know. Yeah. But that they weren't really allowed to do anything. I uh. To me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway. Yeah. It's funny. Tonight I was uh helping my kid with an essay on uh Stalin. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how uh in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war. And actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh. I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh they're certainly all leaders. And uh and uh with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them. Yeah. And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the uh people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it. Otherwise there'd be they'd get you someplace else. <SEP> Uh-huh. Looking back it seems like that was only partly true. That uh there might have been a better place to draw the line. Uh I guess you can I guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight uh brought the cold war to an end. But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to uh call the bully out and beat him. And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war. They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward. And uh we were wrong. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I uh you know. The like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable. But the accumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation where. And as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than uh committing uh committing to a completely and uh winning it whatever that would mean. Yeah. Well I I I think we did I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh we weren't prepared for. I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war. Yeah. <SEP> Uh I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war. I mean they seemed like a valiant thing. Yeah. You knew you knew who was good. You knew who was bad. Yeah. <SEP> And it was a it was a traditional m- the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is. Well you're not. But in in the Vietnam war it seems like it was. A a the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad. And and uh you know the. It's ambivalent. Yeah. <SEP> Even. It seems like even the people you know. Had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and of course the Laotians. And the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved. But. What what about the domestic effects. Like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it uh possible and even popular to uh criticize the government. And they. That pendulum started to swing uh ma- maybe even too far. To the point where uh uh supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And that tradition is still. I mean it's dying now. But it's still alive as opposed to. This Desert Storm stuff may have uh killed it. Yeah. But I think that was one of the biggest. That you know the uh th- the domestic unrest.
sw4345.txt:I uh get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio. Uh that is one of my big sources for current events information. Uh I really like that coverage. My wife uh on the other hand is home most of the day. And she watches a lot of the cable news network. Have you seen uh h- have you uh ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED? No. We don't have the uh national public radio in in my area. Uh-huh. <SEP> I can hear it at the uh uh oh the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away. But the F M signal doesn't reach this far. Uh-huh. Uh I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit. It gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I agree with you too on the uh uh the cable channel C N N and HEADLINE NEWS. Uh I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why I rely on shortwave and and then the cable cable C N N. Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm uh interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it. Uh how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world uh compares with the American coverage of. How do you think that uh the viewpoints differ? I think a lot of it is just uh the fact that in the U S you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts. Or or it's not happening in your backyard. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's it's more of a it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what's on shortwave. It's B B C is uh oh I don't know the right word is is almost uh. They almost take all emotions out of it when they report it. Uh-huh. And it just. They seem to give more of just the facts than opinions. Do you think then that uh the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts? <SEP> Uh very much so. Very much so. And I I think a lot of it is uh especially T V news. They don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to uh oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it. I mean I you know I think it's important to interpret it. But a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to to do the interpreting. Uh-huh. Which uh which approach do you find to be uh more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting? <SEP> Oh I like the straight reporting. Uh and then I I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it. It's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it. Uh-huh. Uh I always think it's humorous when when the President gives the State of the Union and uh for thirty minutes. And then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard. <SEP> And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they what they write into it. Uh-huh. So I overall I think I would rather hear just straight reporting. One of the things that I found interesting last year during the uh the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available. Uh there was a there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely uh uh hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory. And while he was being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda. But people were really down on him for reporting the fact that th- you know this isn't a baby milk factory. How could he say it was uh. I I think that that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them. <SEP> Yeah. I I think people are people have that opinion. They they want to sit down in front of the TV and uh or at a read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every-.
sw4617.txt:Okay. I say they uh. Probably the best things to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water. If they sink they're innocent right. I see. A a good a good southern solution. <SEP> Yeah. Uh so uh how do you how do you feel? Th- that's of course being facetious. But. Uh-huh. You'd have to say that. <SEP> Uh I don't know. The the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing. Uh-huh. And seems to me that that's I think that's the way it's done now. Uh at least my understanding of the law which isn't very good. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh it seems to me that the judge does it. And I I think that's probably all right in that they you know maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I guess also what the system will absorb. Right. <SEP> Probably more tuned in to that. Possibly though on uh capital cases like maybe the death penalty. Uh-huh. Uh I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole. I mean he could have like a personal prejudice. You know judges are people like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial. That's right. <SEP> But maybe uh. And I think that may I that may be an exception as well. Because I think that. Doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge? I I think that's I think that's the way it is. Yeah. <SEP> Uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh the accused or whatever would get the uh get the death penalty. Do they have a death penalty in California? Yes. In fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh there's a big uproar going on right now. Uh. Yeah. The uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know it's someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact. <SEP> Yeah. I. Something like that I've got no problem with it. Uh. Yeah. I guess the way I think about it is not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge. It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people. Uh-huh. <SEP> Put it to sleep you know. Just get it out you know. It's not able to fit in you know. Something inexpensive. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Uh I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just. <SEP> If somebody gets the death penalty they're they're judged guilty. They got the death penalty. They should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal. And if not you know don't don't let them sit up there on death row for you know fifteen years. Yeah. I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years. Uh-huh. Yeah. That. But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake. And you'd hate to be one of those. <SEP> Yeah. Oh I'm sure. Yeah. The other thing they asked about was whether uh uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which again I think is the way it is now. That all the all verdicts. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well maybe not. I don't know. At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous. I believe it is in capital. <SEP> I think in like uh lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever. How ever many is on sitting on a jury. Uh-huh. I t- I believe that's the way it is. But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. Uh. Yeah. The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is is uh different than the other eleven. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And uh they've only deliberated four hours or something. <SEP> And they say they're hopelessly deadlocked. Oh no. And the judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet. <SEP> I'm telling you go one way or the other. That that's probably an expensive trial. Uh. Yeah. Six months so far they said. <SEP> Yeah. Probably. So. Yeah. Probably. You know I'm not sure there's a number. It's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know worth of all the free for all. Maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's that's been so long I've prac- practically forgot who Noriega was you know. Right. That has been going on. My uh cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. So she follows that stuff pretty closely. But uh. That's interesting. Yeah. She's not involved in that that case. But she does. Well have you ever served on a jury? <SEP> No. I haven't. I never have. My wife has. But I I haven't. Uh-huh. I got called. But I uh never uh got selected for a jury. Uh-huh. I sat for tw- ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they had some guy that was uh defending himself. <SEP> Uh-huh.
sw4902.txt:And you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue? Uh yes. I do as far as uh as far as uh as far as immigration as a whole goes. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world. Uh-huh. Uh I. There just is not going to be room for all of us. We don't have jobs now. I I think uh I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time. Uh I hope you're one of the employed right now. Uh-huh. <SEP> I am one of the unemployed right now. I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company. And uh I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings. But they had two thousand applications. Yeah. <SEP> And I know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you know doing my line of work. Uh-huh. And of course I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job. Right. <SEP> So how do you feel? Well I'm a little bit ambivalent. The problem with uh and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in in terms of what uh really is driving it. They're not willing to tell the truth. The same way with uh issues of uh race and things like that. I mean right now uh I believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration. Three actually. One is at the high end uh. They always want to be able to uh do some brain draining. They always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou. Or you know. Right. They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field. And so they can almost always find room for someone like that. At the bottom end they uh are always willing to uh let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area. <SEP> Those are two things that I think are going on. Although they I I don't think the politicians would tell you that. <SEP> Okay. And I think you're right in both cases. And then the third thing is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico. They can not close off the Mexican border. Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country. <SEP> So they keep allowing uh the pressure cooker to let off steam. And I think probably it's pretty important right there. How do you feel about Haitian immigration? Uh that's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan. I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into uh society. They're very difficult uh group to find jobs and uh and uh places for. And so uh uh I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are. But I'm not to sympathetic about uh letting large numbers of Haitians in. <SEP> Actually actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here. Yeah. And it would have nothing to do with political situations. It would have to do with poverty. Right. But if you let them yeah. If you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population. But po- politically and economically. <SEP> Oh my gosh. Have you been have you been to southern Florida? Yeah. Well I know about it. Uh I mean it's it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago. <SEP> Well I mean and the two of them together. I mean we can. It's just as well you know. It's hardly America anymore. On the other hand you know the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant. So there's uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in. But there's some differences in the immigrants that that we're getting now. <SEP> Well I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration. Right. Sure. <SEP> I think probably your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals. Right. <SEP> But uh the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into America. Uh they they don't bother to learn our language. And uh first of all th- they. I'm sorry this I really feel strongly about this. Uh-huh. <SEP> We send a lot of money to Mexico. Uh-huh.
sw4707.txt:Not very good. It's not been a good day. I went I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon. <SEP> I don't know. I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn. So I hope she's turned it in. Are you eating? Uh I ju-. Go ahead. I'll stop eating. I just barely got home from the university. <SEP> No it's. Say what? I just barely got home from the university. <SEP> Tell you what we can do is uh I can punch the uh one. And then w- after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want. Okay. Go ahead. Fire away. <SEP> Uh I love the irony of uh talking about this subject on April the fifteenth. But uh I'm afraid I'm I'm probably in the minority. I I actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country. Uh uh particularly uh in this part of the country w-. I agree with you. <SEP> Uh I guess I do have a a bone to pick with uh uh the way taxes are distributed. Uh I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form. Huh. And the sales tax can't. I think that's regressive. And uh uh it's kind of dumb. I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax. But on the other hand I don't mind that it's only on you know things that aren't like groceries and that. It's not on that. <SEP> Well I mean nobody taxes groceries. Oh yeah. They do. Where? In Arizona. <SEP> Is that right? Uh-huh. But we have a pretty low income ta- I mean pretty low tax rate here. Oh I think the the sales tax they just got to do something about it. <SEP> Right. But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes. Right. But I guess when I hear when I see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty-one forty-two and ours are like thirty-six thirty-seven you know. If you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well. T- th- there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are. Well and I still think that having lived in Europe for awhile you know difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Well I mean I think. I was in Germany you know for several years. <SEP> Right. And I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there. Oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher taxes. Yeah. Higher taxes. Yeah. <SEP> I suppose that's true. Yeah. Uh probably m- less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever. But. Still's that way to some extent. Yeah. I think the other problem is you know it it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you theoretically can do something about. <SEP> Right. But I look for example. And you're not quite in the same situation. But like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world. Right. I wish I didn't have to pay any more fo- to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Yeah. Since uh I send my kids to parochial school that. Yeah. That that's probably a little tougher on you. <SEP> It's not it's not quite the bargain that. But I mean I pay them gladly. That's a decision. I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f- with the same tax money. But uh I mean that's that's the way Americans want to interpret it. I guess that's all right. But. Yeah. I. <SEP> And if I were uh. When I was single and again when I'm retired I will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good. That's always been a high priority. No. I think that's just you though. <SEP> I do. Yeah. That's true. I think in places I think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the uh uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are uh just looking for fun th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens. Yeah. <SEP> And uh there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done. That seems a a like a cultural lapse. I mean people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools. They. Of course I think with the graying of America we're going to see that problem in lots of places. <SEP> Right. Yeah. People would rather uh increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them. But I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted. Or build roads. Yeah. <SEP> Well.
sw4784.txt:Yeah. I guess uh uh it's an easy one for me. I think that's uh there's something seriously wrong. Yeah. What is it that you are you know particularly upset about? Uh I guess uh I think they've lost their compass. And uh I'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore. But uh I voted with my feet. And uh my kids go to parochial school. <SEP> Uh-huh. So uh. What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in a the public school system? Well one hundred percent of the uh customers care. That's one thing. Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting. And uh they uh take an active relatively active part. Which uh I mean if you're uh sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on and you uh uh pay attention and participate. And and you can influence the way things are. <SEP> So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of uh real estate or other taxes. And and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen? Yeah. The immediacy just isn't there. Uh-huh. And uh uh I also think that one of the problems. And actually I don't think this I think this is a cultural problem. The uh problem with public education is really uh really a problem with the culture. And I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school. And you can't get a tax levy passed. Uh people are uh reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh they don't have kids in the schools. <SEP> Right. I think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of uh uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids. I think that's uh that's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it as uh as their problem. And there's an immediate problem. Right. It troubles me too tha- that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good. And by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that uh you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level. Right. <SEP> Yeah. Uh it means that you've got to be informed. And you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision. Yeah. <SEP> You know I I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution. Uh you know it barely made it. I think it was added afterwards. I think the real the principal was uh education for civic participation. Right. The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter. And you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes. <SEP> Right. It has taken on a more profound. And you'd think we'd notice it economic uh thrust. Yeah. Well that's exactly what I was going to say. Now there seem to be really three reasons for education. One is education for civic duty. One is education for economic reasons. And one is education for civilization. I mean and I think that one. Well I'm glad that you added that one. Yeah. I think that one's significant. That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor. And then I quit and got disabused of that notion. But uh the uh uh now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is uh an economic enterprise to train people for jobs. And uh I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is. And I'm really sad to say this. I never thought I would have. But I really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem. And uh that's why I guess I'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs. <SEP> Right. Well I I g- agree with everything that you've said so far. And the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact I think with public school teachers than perhaps you are uh except as a parent of your child. And the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing. And they are the three things that you mentioned. But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related. Right. That's what. Like consumer.
sw4321.txt:Well have you ever served on a jury? No. I've not. I've been called. But I had to beg off from the duty. And you? Well I was called. And then I was not chosen. <SEP> Um. Well I was I was uh originally chosen primarily I think because I was a young fellow. And they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict. I don't know why. Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago. Oh really? Yeah. It's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason. And they kind of liked me. I looked conser- and all that stuff. And they. I don't know what they saw in me. But they saw it. But uh back to the issue is uh. I don't know. At times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun. But there too there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly I think in civil cases. In criminal cases I'd like to see the unani- unanimity remain. But in civil cases I think a majority rule by by jury would be sufficient. Well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that? <SEP> Well in a criminal case say one in which you know there is like say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this. And in civil law there you know is such a thing as like let's say uh misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that. A majority rule I think would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases. I don't know if I'm making any sense or not. Well I mean I think. Are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more uh tangible. Or. Yeah. Often there's more incriminating evidence. Like for instance say uh and also too. I think I'm I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious in a criminal case. Well do you think that that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up? <SEP> Um well I really can't say for certain truth be known. Uh as it stands there's there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a civil uh civil and criminal case. I mean the uh documentary the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that. You know I don't know for if you're familiar with that or not. No. I'm not. A uh fellow when he was much younger uh was tried and convicted and sentenced to death. Fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked. And uh so he served out his his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system. The case was reopened. And he was exonerated. Well I mean I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served. <SEP> Yeah. Many laws but little justice. Say. But uh. And I also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that uh the just the process of picking jurors is not always objective. Oh certainly not. Certainly not. And you know they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this. But they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires. You know the. Because you get up. And and they ask you a few questions. Both sides do. And then you you're either challenged which is. You know each attorney can use that as much as they like. Or I think it's a limit now. They probably have a limit now. But they pretty much go through that. And then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve. For me it was financial hardship. So. But onto the thing uh I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing. It was always my impression that the Justice himself or herself had the final say.
sw4372.txt:So let's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order. And after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? Well actually I don't think they're out of line. De- Devil's advocate possibly. But it you are trying to avoid paying taxes. And whe- whether or not you agree with that law i- you're still circumventing it. You are legal in in your circumvention of that law. What what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying uh income tax on something that you purchase mail order? <SEP> Really I I I don't think that's a valid argument. I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax. Um s- s- naturally some some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or or uh Bryn Mawr stereo dealer. Uh but th- th- th- then why not pay pay the sales tax. Corporations have to. Why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax? Well I mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when I purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania. It's because I'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Yes. Uh it's because I I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. So I go outside the area for that. And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state. I don't I don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer. <SEP> I I'll agree it it's not your responsibility. But b- is it also legal for you to do that? W- w- fr- from what I understand from v- v- various net readings i- i- it the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes uh in into place in the next few years. It is it is a lost revenue stream right now. And states c- can use all the revenue they can get. With some with something like that d- do your arguments still apply? Well I think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then I don't argue with it. Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh I bought this out of state. I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania. <SEP> Which is exactly what businesses do at the present. Right. But the point is is that businesses do that. The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question. That's a cost of doing business. The burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer. And I I I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it. <SEP> Uh. That's my understanding of the way uh the way it works. Usually the the person ordering doesn't pay. But the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. And there r- there are s- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that. Uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing. <SEP> I-. No. Businesses uh if purchasing things mail order. <SEP> If if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these this great deal on forty-six mother boards uh from from say Utah. Um I I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. My a- accounting department will at the end of the month. I think that i- i- I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania. And I know they work that way in uh say here in D C. Yeah. See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't I never see that end of the business. Yeah. So my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. Uh but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that uh the opportunity f- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided. <SEP> That's true. I- i- a r- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh I I forgot that. There there is no well defined mechanism at all. And and that it is a a l- loss. I I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju- just to do just that in or- in order to gain the revenue that's being lost. Uh I mean I I don't know if I agree with that. But it but.
sw4339.txt:Yeah. Jonathan uh you s- you say it's near and dear to your heart. Buying a car is uh something you're contemplating I take it. Uh fantasizing about. Uh. <SEP> Can't do it right now. Our situation is that we're a two car family. Uh-huh. And I have a mini van we bought a few years ago. Uh. <SEP> It's got a uh five year loan. So that's still got a couple years to run. Uh-huh. And the car I get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month. So I think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years if I can. Wow. They get. <SEP> Uh-huh. What do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next? <SEP> Well since I just turned forty I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car something uh something real sporty. Uh-huh. But uh realistically with uh the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. Uh-huh. <SEP> Something a little seating room. How about you? Well I think the next car we get will probably be a well. I I like Buicks. We have a Buick Century now. It's a nineteen eighty-seven. Uh-huh. And uh whatever I get I want to have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over. So I think the four door is probably a major requirement. <SEP> Sure. And other than that uh you know reasonable cost and safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car. Uh you know I'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh. Sure. Something that will carry it around careful I guess is best best way to describe it. Right now we've got a V six. And it that seems to be just fine. I know they s- they're coming out with some V eight now. And I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age. <SEP> Yeah. I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back. So they've got some pretty powerful sixes. Uh-huh. And uh you know V eights seem to be a return to the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon. Right. I uh I drive a a truck a Ford truck. I I like trucks because they're spacious. And it's handy to haul things. Uh it's not related to my business. I just really use it basically for transportation. But there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that. And it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one. <SEP> Sure. Is uh traction much of an issue for you up there. Traction? <SEP> Uh not really uh you know. It's a two wheel drive truck. And I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway. Actually uh pretty good way of looking at it. Yeah. We uh we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago. Wow. <SEP> A case where there was a sort of freak ice storm. And we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car. And this is a rear wheel drive model. So we got some monster studded snow tires after that. Uh-huh. Haven't had any problems since. What kind of what make is the mini van? <SEP> It's a Mazda. Mazda. I see. And uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh driveability. Fuel economy isn't great being a mini van. But uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others. And it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around. Right. <SEP> So we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon. One of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager I guess. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And uh they have a a child that's five years old. And it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff. And of course as he gets friends I'm sure that will be even handier. So I know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value. Yeah. I think that we're going to be uh owning a mini van for some years to come. Probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway. What about uh all wheel drive? Is that something that you'd be interested in. Or is that. <SEP> Uh I'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra. Uh-huh. And even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh again like you if conditions are are that bad I probably don't want to be driving anyway. Right. So I know I'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door. You know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the.
sw4370.txt:Actually to tell you the truth I think uh jury selection is a uh prime uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh uh finding of uh guilt. Uh I certainly can't argue with that. Definitely does need some improvements. Uh. <SEP> And the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to. Yeah. I think there's a limit on that. The uh the uh peremptory challenges are limited to I don't know how many. I think it's Four or five. But you can. <SEP> I can't remember which. I was on a jury trial last year. Only I got kicked out as uh the last selection that the uh defense got. Um. Yeah. It seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things. I think I have a severe demeanor or something. Um. Uh. <SEP> That uh. But typically you know basic- uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process. And I suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who is well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice. Right. But it still has to be a group of your peers. Right. <SEP> See. So. So if it's your peers and you're not educated then. So if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd you'd have to have nincompoops to uh. <SEP> You want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them. <SEP> Um. So that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant. Uh-huh. <SEP> So uh I think the jury selection process is pretty neat. But I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards. Um. I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have. M- you're talking about the person's already been found guilty right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And many times I've seen on trials they have on T V the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever. But I think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be. Um. Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure. Also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure. Well I suppose you may be right on that. Matter of fact I've heard that I've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that. <SEP> Well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime. But when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side. And the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury. Oh is it? Oh I didn't realize that. Okay. <SEP> At least in California they're supposed to be. Not during the trial. During the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background. Right. But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down I think that uh that they should. Uh-huh. <SEP> I don't I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial. They get too boring. Uh-huh. So you what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them. Well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time. Um. <SEP> So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better. When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing I'm all for that for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant. You give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things. What about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets. I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. Like what? Well uh say embezzlement right. Ri-. <SEP> You get a guy down the street who comes up uh carrying a kni-.
sw4325.txt:Okay. So What kind of experience do you do you have then with child care? I guess I think uh I wonder if that worked. <SEP> Does it say something? I think it usually does. You might try uh. I don't know. Hold it down a little longer. And see if it uh. Okay. Well Does it usually make a recording or s-. <SEP> Okay. I Well I don't remember. It seemed like it did. But it might not. I guess I guess we can start. Uh. Okay. <SEP> Okay. No. I don't I don't have any kids. I uh my sister has a she just had a baby. He's about five months old. And she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different. Uh-huh. <SEP> Do you have kids? I have three. Oh really? Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I do. Yes. Uh I don't work though. But I used to work and when I had two children. Uh-huh. I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit. But I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care. <SEP> Yeah. But does your sister live in a big community? Uh yeah. She lives. It's a it's a fairly large community. She uh got real lucky though. He had a boss who uh moved into a larger office. Uh-huh. <SEP> And she's able to take her baby to work with her. Oh really? And it's a small office that she works in. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it's a it's a legal firm office. And it's just one lawyer. Um. And so she's the only one really that takes care of the office. There's no one else that works there. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby. So it works out pretty good for her. Wow. How lucky. I I know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids. <SEP> Yeah. And but the community I'm in is not a real large one. So there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that you know. You either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to. Yeah. So it's fairly safe. Yeah. To get references and that. So but uh. I I d- don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because there's so many kids and so many. <SEP> Worried that they're not going to get enough attention? Yeah. And uh you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things. Yeah. But and they're expensive. And course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things. <SEP> Yes. Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that. But. Take a long time to find the right place. Yeah. And you and you don't always even know if it's it's going to be the right place or not. Uh-huh. <SEP> Anything I guess could happen. Uh-huh. Because after I guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care. Uh-huh. When he starts toddling around and stuff. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. When when he's not when she can't keep control of him. And he starts crawling. That's. Uh-huh. It would be hard. I think it would be kind of stressful. It would be nice to have him around. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh seems like you know. Goll-. What if he cried at the wrong time. Or the phone rang or you know at the wrong time. <SEP> Yeah. But. I think she has problems with that too. Uh-huh. Well when you have kids will you work? Do you work now? <SEP> I don't know. That's something I've considered. Uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time. Uh-huh. Is that what you do? Uh yeah. Actually I teach my kids at home. So I'm here all the time. <SEP> Oh so they don't go to school. Is it like uh. Oh what's that called. It's uh correspondence school. They do it at home. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> That's interesting. So. Do you have to have any special training? Not. It depends on the state you live actually. Some laws absolutely prohibit it. Some states uh say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that. Our state doesn't yet say that. And I'm not a certified teacher. I went to college. But I you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now. And so. <SEP> So they haven't been to public schools at all. One of them was for a couple of years. And so you know my oldest he was. And then my youngest two have never been. Um. So anyway. But we don't. <SEP> So you've never had.
sw4347.txt:Okay. So what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products? Uh not too bad really. Uh I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just I really didn't want it. But I got it anyway. And uh it was a Braun. And they were real good about taking it back. It wasn't a problem at all. So uh I was able to get that back pretty easily. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh I don't know. I really haven't returned a whole lot lately. Have you? I haven't had to. It's uh the. Every so often. I mean I I I'm almost pushing it myself. Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's. And it shrinks too much. And say well I should have known better. I mean I bought it from G I Joe's. Um. And it was probably made in China by slaves. <SEP> Right. But uh they uh. Most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway I get pretty good stuff. Yeah. I think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized. <SEP> Right. Like. And if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find. Exactly. It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S. <SEP> I was reading. Right. I was reading something in uh CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact. They were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out. And about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever. Yeah. Uh like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger. And and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi. Huh. <SEP> You know so it's like what are you going to do you know? Yeah. Really. But uh that's the way it is. I don't know. I I personally feel that uh uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them you know that's the way it goes. And you know people man- more than manufacturers should get a clue. And you know they should start making quality products. Yeah. I think they're beginning to. The the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away. And. <SEP> That's what I thought too until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue. Uh-huh. Uh they've got all the American well all the all the cars rated you know. And uh essentially I h- I don't see much of a trend. I mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there. There's nothing wrong with them. Uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars. But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy. And they're pieces of junk. I know. Still at it hey. <SEP> Yeah. That's ninety that's eighty-six through ninety-one. Wow. But uh I don't know. May- maybe they're getting better. Maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh. Well they got a three year lead time. It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so. <SEP> Yeah. That's just it. Technology that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road. But uh. The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer. Oh yeah. Yeah. Because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time. And can you think of any other industry where in software they. <SEP> Uh. If the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail s-. Yeah. Or uh maybe I say well you know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade. <SEP> Yeah. It. Uh th- they keep up c- with it pretty quickly. And that's that's a real good thing I guess. Yeah. <SEP> Uh I don't know. And the hardware well I mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity. And the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along. Yeah. <SEP> Right. They're kind of the leaders right now you know. I used to see all those commercials for Windows you know. And you're like oh gee they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name. Really. Why don't they just say almost a Mac for half the price. <SEP> Yeah you know. They'd sell more if they were honest. Exactly. Almost is the key word there too you know because I I really I've used both. And I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all. Yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. Base. <SEP> Uh. Yeah yeah that's true too. <SEP> But uh I don't know. I'm really I've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home. I I do use a Mac at work. But uh uh I really don't don't do much with it at home. Uh-huh. But uh. Apple's sort of making a s-. And they're ones were. Growling consumer uh need to worry about the Mac they're getting. Like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back. They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. Yeah. You sound like you must uh work in the computer business. Yeah. I have one. I do desktop publishing at work. And I have a machine at home. And I belong to the user's group. And I I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out. <SEP> Yeah? All right. But uh technically I'm not actually in the industry. I don't work a computer company. No? I'm an abuser. <SEP> Well that's that's all right. But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen. Yeah. That's true. <SEP> Something that I find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer. And you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know. Let let's take the example the modem for you know. Yeah. Okay. W- w- what baud rate do you get? Well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-.
sw4548.txt:Well actually uh. I I don't think I'm in the uh majority of in in Texas. I don't think I agree with. <SEP> Oh really. No. You don't believe in it? Uh I wouldn't say that. I think I would have said that a few years ago. <SEP> When I was younger I thought it was uh a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment. But um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion. Yeah. I'm not thoroughly opposed to it. I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment. But I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought. <SEP> You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with. Uh-huh. She has very very black and white opinions you know. There's no gray in her opinions you know. She she probably would agree more with you. But but I don't know. I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again. I've never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done. Yeah. And we see that more and more. Like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know that's fourteen years old. What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult. Yeah. I certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose. Yeah. I'm not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail. But uh. <SEP> No. It doesn't. But it costs less. Yeah. That that's a factor. <SEP> And yeah. To me it is. I mean I work and I pay my taxes. And I lived out in Texas for a little while. And they're. And that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia. I mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in Georgia. Right. But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part. If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well I. The cost is something. But it's but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime. And I guess I would like. I don't know. The European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment. And they they don't have a crime problem either. <SEP> Oh really. No. You can't. They don't execute anybody in Britain or France. And I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either. And they don't have the crime problems we do. I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two. Yeah. I guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when I see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing. And the that that bothers me. <SEP> You might be right. But it. But uh. I mean I I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know. <SEP> I would never in a million years want that job. Huh. But I do believe it's necessary. And I. Yeah. <SEP> On the one hand I I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing. Huh. And I couldn't pull the switch. But uh. Well actually I wha-. The other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it uh I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else. I think it just becomes a uh symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians. So. <SEP> Yeah. I would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh. Right. Like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country. <SEP> Uh-huh. Now I'm I'm not so sure of that. I'm I I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around. <SEP> What what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing? Uh I guess I'm I'm. My view of uh. My. I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh that uh uh costs and other factors justify uh uh executing people. <SEP> Yeah. Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that uh uh than anything else. And uh I've also never been a victim although I have some I have two friends whose wives were murdered. And uh I can imagine that uh uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case. <SEP> Oh gosh. Oh yes. If it ever touched my fam-.
sw4318.txt:Before the one will take. Uh okay. Let's see. I guess uh I can start. I'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing. Are you really? Yeah. Uh so I'm looking at uh something larger than what we have. We've got like an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty-nine Horizon. So I'm looking for something uh littler bigger. <SEP> Uh-huh. Which are both kind of small. Yeah. Uh so we were thinking mini van for a while. And uh we're looking at uh some just four door five passenger sedans as well. Uh-huh. <SEP> Are you looking for an American car. Or you open to buying foreign cars? Uh I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know. Uh-huh. It's you know it. I guess the American cars had a bad reputation. But I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Personally I have a Japanese car right now. And I really like it a lot. Uh I think the Japanese really build good cars. Uh-huh. And I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now. But I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while. Yeah. <SEP> If I were to buy another car I would be uh I would be partial to buying another Japanese car. But I would also look at American cars. But when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also. And I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product. Yeah. I mean e- even if it's just details it seems like uh they you know. So if I were. <SEP> Right. I j-. There's a door seal that s- doesn't quite seal. And you have to take it back every once in a while. It's clearly just a a design problem there. Right. It is. Uh I'm kind of. Right now. The next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car. I would really like to have a sports car. Uh I don't really I don't have a family. So I don't need a a mini van or such to uh haul people around in. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh. Oh like a Miata or something like that? Well I like the Miata. But I don't like it enough to buy it. I would buy something. Actually the the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car. Um. <SEP> But uh something along that lines. Interesting. Uh because I have a an economy car right now which is okay. But uh I think I I'd like to move on to something a little better. Yeah. <SEP> That's interesting. Yeah. I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for you know size and safety and then mileage. Right. Probably. <SEP> Right. Uh. That's. When I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage. And I was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was g- that I would get a for the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was that was worth that money. Yeah. <SEP> So. Yeah. I c- I think in terms of computer terminology I look at you know price performance and things like that. And then a little bit at life expectancy I guess. Right. Exactly. But it you know depends on what you what you pay initially. <SEP> Yeah. But you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger. That's right. Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage. <SEP> Uh-huh. And she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton. Uh-huh. It's you know. We we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles. But uh the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it. <SEP> Uh-huh. So But uh. <SEP> Okay. Uh I've had uh I've had one or two American cars I think. And and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once. And and I never had a problem with it. But uh my mother had a Dodge at one point. And I I had driven it a few times. And I really did not feel that it that I would buy a Dodge j- just from. Um. <SEP> Well actually I had a uh a Dodge Omni at one point. Uh-huh. And that was I think what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality uh car. Yeah. <SEP> So I guess you'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car. That's interesting. But. Yeah. It it's hard to beat some of the. Uh like I guess in particular we're looking at a like a ninety-one Corsica uh buy back at a they say G M sponsored auction. But I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you. <SEP> Which is a good deal. Yeah. Because I guess uh. I mean well ninety-twos granted but the new ones you know. Uh-huh. Fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot. <SEP> Right. So all the depreciation has been taken off. And s- the dealer comes out okay you know. Yeah. That. I don't know what kind of I don't know what G M corporate kind of hit the I don't know what kind of hit they take on it. But sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it. And So but uh I don't know. <SEP> Yeah. I'm sure they did. We keep looking at that mini van. It's just you know. We can get a like a Caravan for at twelve five. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now. But uh uh it's interesting. But uh I don't know. If if uh it seems to be.
sw4691.txt:Oh so. Okay. I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so. Well it. Let's put it this way. We've got the New England Patriots up here. So. <SEP> Oh yeah. Right. Well. They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years. Really? Yeah. <SEP> Why? Um well uh partly due to ownership. You know uh Victor Kiam owned the uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years. Uh-huh. And he always had this uh this wonderful quality of c- being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something. And uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth. And it recently was sold to uh some other people. So hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England area anyways. <SEP> Yeah. Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you. Oh yeah. I've been to a couple I've been to a few games before. <SEP> Uh-huh. Now you you're you're from Texas. Right. So you've got two football teams down there. <SEP> Well it depends on where you're from in Texas. I live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned. Uh-huh. Oh I see. <SEP> That's how it is. There's that type of segregation huh? It's divided. Yeah. Wow !. <SEP> It really is. So we've got our Cowboys here. And and uh I don't think anybody roots differently. Uh-huh. But I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno. Do you. <SEP> And he is for the L the uh Raiders. L A Raiders. Uh-huh. So. Do you follow professional sports at all? <SEP> Well I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well. But I've been trying more this year. I think I know a little more than I use to. Yeah. <SEP> I never knew very much at all. So I'm trying. Well it's a good past time you know. Yeah. Particularly football. They say uh i- football attracts more men because of the you know y- the you see the the physical aggression on the field. And supposedly psychologists say that uh that uh men take out their frustrations by watching football. And you know they get together with a bunch of guys. And they uh uh and they have a good time and everything. And that's suppose to be some of the uh the male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts I guess or something about the uh. <SEP> So I shouldn't even try to do it huh? Well no. It it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest. Yes. I think that uh. I personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport. It has the speed. <SEP> Right. And the hand eye coordination. And it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey. Yeah. So we. And. That's. We're a big hockey area up here. I bet up here in New England as well as you know in in the Minnesota area. <SEP> Really. But. I don't even think we have that in Texas. What hockey? <SEP> We might. Do we? I mean no. You probably know. I don't know. No. There's no hockey. There's no. <SEP> Nobody talks about it. So I don't think we do. There's no professional hockey teams in in Texas. No. Uh-huh. And we have a soccer team that comes and goes. We don't even have that very much. So. Yeah. I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like they have this World Football League. You see we have the N F L that that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams. Yeah. There are those teams that play in professional National Football League. But uh now they have what's called the World Football League. And they have all these teams from. There's a team in London. And there's a team there there's uh teams other European teams. <SEP> Oh. And there's teams in the United States. An- and they're playing now during the summer months. And it's really you know overkill. Oh yeah. And there's only so much football you can watch. <SEP> Yeah. Well I like to do. I don't like to watch. Yeah. That's good. I don't like to watch anything. So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff. I think it's an excuse to do nothing. <SEP> And I I can see what you're saying about the male bonding. And the guys get together. Yeah. And that's kind of cool. That's fun you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> But it can get really overdone. Now have you ever been to a professional football game? Yeah. I have. Have you? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I have. Did you do the whole big th- the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole. Uh no. Actually no. Well see now see that's what you got to do see. Now we talked our. <SEP> I've done that for college football. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You the. Well the same thing. <SEP> Yeah. We we talked our wives. There's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games. And uh we talked our wives into going with us one time. And they had a real good time. And it was basically for the social atmosphere. Right. And that's the thing you know. You go you know three or four hours before the game. You go set up. We set a table up. We do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more. <SEP> Yeah. But but that whole. It it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself. But it's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game. I-. <SEP> Yeah. That you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with with a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know. That's right. You you miss that. <SEP> Yeah. That's right. And and any professional sport I think you miss that. <SEP> Uh-huh. The atmosphere of being there you know. Yeah. Well in high school I went to every football game. And well I twirled you know. <SEP> Yep. And I you know I didn't. I still don't know that much about football obviously. But I still had a good time. You know. Well foot-.
sw4830.txt:You want to go first? No. You can start. Okay. Uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we d- wh- what do we think about a judge making the decision? <SEP> Uh-huh. And I really don't agree with that. I think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than e- having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time. Right. Yo- you know what I mean? <SEP> Right. There's there th- this topic is kind of mute. Uh. Yeah. There there's no way. We we couldn't survive in a sy- in a juror syst- in a trial system without a jury. Right. <SEP> Uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case. That's it. Uh every person has their opinions. And that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh. Well I I feel the other thing too uh. They were saying uh you know what new ways could y- could it you you know change the system. I I really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal. <SEP> I mean i- if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught you know point blank in the crime. There's uh no question. Right. It's beyond a reasonable doubt. You know all these things. I mean you know we've gone through this over and over again. <SEP> Right. They shouldn't allow an appeal. And it can go on for ten twenty years. <SEP> Yep. I I think this is a little ridiculous. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers. Oh that's right. I work for a law firm. I I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha- that exist in the s- in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining. <SEP> Right. You know if someone is ill. Well plea bar- plea bargaining is a different story. Well. <SEP> Plea bargaining is something completely different. That that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up. Well I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard. I mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they. I don't know how it works exactly. But you know they get lesser sentences. Right. And I understand that the jails are full of people you know uh and that they have to do something. <SEP> Right. But I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it. Huh. Yo- you know what I'm saying? That w- we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment. <SEP> Right. And uh I I think they should. We do. I and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people. And uh you know all. <SEP> Right. They they're caught dead to rights. I I just think that that's they've they've taken a life. And if they should pay for it with their life. Right. When you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned. Yeah. <SEP> We just have the case. I'm I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry. Uh-huh. Uh his f- last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up. Oh really. <SEP> So I mean his appeal was denied. And two days later he got out of jail. For cocaine possession. It uh. Yeah. <SEP> But uh that was absurd. There is never there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence. I know that that. Uh-huh. And I don't know. Uh what would you do to change it? To make it better? <SEP> Well uh the the only I can I wa- you know. The appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Uh a- like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd. There's no way that could work. Oh yeah. I I I don't agree with that at all. Uh but. Imagine the guilt that person would have. I mean burned out. <SEP> Oh exactly. There's there's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself. Exactly. <SEP> Right. If you had to do something like that day after day. No one would want the job. No. Not really. <SEP> Uh and you know like I said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case. Well w- do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like. Oh yeah. I I feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury. That that that right s-. I mean supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you. <SEP> Well I mean were there witnesses? In other words you're saying that w- you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were. Right. <SEP> Right. That you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case. Yeah. I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place. Yeah. <SEP> And you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances. Well I I.
sw4319.txt:Uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job. And how do you feel about them? Uh pretty good actually. I work for Hewlett Packard. And they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package. In fact they're they're kind of known uh for having good benefits. The pay isn't fabulous. Although I saw a survey recently. And I'm actually making just about as much as you know I'm m- making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me. Oh that's good. <SEP> Uh-huh. What kind of a degree have you got? <SEP> I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering. So. Oh. And I'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good. We've got stock purchase program and a. That that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain. Uh-huh. But uh there's a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh there's. How long have you been with them? <SEP> I've been with them for seven years. Uh. Yeah. That's good. <SEP> And the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything. Uh-huh. So uh it's not t-. But there's full uh th- there's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything. I don't get sick that often. So I don't pay much of it. B- and I pay five dollars every time I visit the the hospital that you know for a checkup or whatever. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh they don't cover eyes though. And I I have contact lenses. So that's kind of a pain. Uh-huh. <SEP> But you know I I can live. But for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. So that you've got small small things to gripe about. Right. Wow. <SEP> And. Well that sounds like you must feel really good about it. Yeah. Yeah. And and the dental plan is fabulous. The dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because uh. Wow. <SEP> I I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that. Uh-huh. But that's not the case. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I guess nothing. It's fabulous. Wow. Uh the. What about you? Well I uh work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory. I also have a part time job at a law firm. And I get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh and benefits through the government are uh really. Uh they just uh they're not the greatest. Uh I before I I uh uh got my degree. <SEP> Uh. I'm uh c- a computer scientist. Uh-huh. And before I got my degree I had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh at that time I was in gravy city. Uh the law firms in this town are not you know. For a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties. Yeah. And uh benefits were just amazing. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we had everything paid for. And uh anyway with the government it's not uh quite that nice a deal. Uh but it's you know it's it's okay. What we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our uh uh our costs. And it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing. And the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet. And uh so I I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good p- plan at this point. Uh but uh it could be better. That's for sure. And uh but you know the- there are other things that you get when you work for the government i- uh in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere. Yeah. It's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where I don't have to uh uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that. And so I'm I'm really kind of happy about that end of of things. It's uh. <SEP> Yeah. One of the things with my company is that they've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security. And uh there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do. Uh-huh. So there's. I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's and I and I haven't had to move my residence to do that. You know I still live in San Jose. And. Wow. That's fabulous. Yeah. It. You see now that's that's interesting. Because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area. <SEP> Oh yeah? Yeah. He he lives in Andover. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh the work that he. He's uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the Hewlett Packard machines that do uh uh sonographic imagining. Right. Right. And uh I've been over to see his complex over there. And it's amazing. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's it's all ecologically designed. And and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up. Yeah. Yeah. And. <SEP> In fact I know a guy who works at Andover who used to work who I used to work with out here. Uh-huh. And he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position. Kind of interesting. Uh a- anyhow.
sw4362.txt:Uh well h- having. Sort of the reason we're going through the school system. I seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing. I'm I'm just graduating col- graduating from college. Uh I didn't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system. However when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and ad-. You can compare just about everyth- thing to Japan. And we look like wh- we don't have anything. Uh it seems to be not difficult enough for students. Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough. Uh however I if it weren't for our needless uh competition with Japan I I'd I'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace. I don't know. Uh I haven't. It's been uh well seventy-nine since I was at school. At high school. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I've seen things change. I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually. Because I wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then. So it's hard to compare. You know what I mean? Right. But uh it seems like when I li- I lived in Chicago. I I've lived down here. I hear the dropout rates from the schools. <SEP> And I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year. Yeah. And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth. <SEP> Huh. I mean I I've seen so many different things. So so many different bad reports coming out of the school system. And I recognize that there are good schools out there. I mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people. Right. <SEP> But uh I don't I don't understand the uh I don't understand I guess why the schools don- seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. Uh well I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then again I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh because the the dropout rate is in those areas w-. It's high in those areas where also there's poverty and and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle whether where you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better. So uh a- the other two a- a-. They're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly to me is a kind of government thing to to fix. But it's just like I I don't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like I don't know. It's it's a complicated issue. I I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school. I don't know if I blame it on the school. I think I think I blame it I think I blame it on a couple of different things. I think I blame it on the school system. Uh. <SEP> Well that's I meant when I said the school. Yeah. I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. I although I think that. I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than. Well they do quite well for themselves. Huh. Well that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid. No. Not all school districts are well paid. But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid. I mean I know one family that's got. They're both teachers. And they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons. <SEP> Uh-huh. They both work all summer full-time. And from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each. <SEP> Yeah. Well it it. I mean that family is making over a hundred grand. And I'm. I mean okay. Okay. Yes. I agree that teaching our kids is important. Right. However these people who only work eight hours day at it from seven to three. <SEP> And they only work nine months a year. And they get an awful lot of breaks in between. And that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that. And I don't even have kids. Yeah. Well that's true. But tha- there's. You can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this. My tax dollars are paying for this. This is wrong. But when you're talk- w- w-. And there's really not much you can directly do about that. I think that that if if there is a problem with the school system uh from it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh paid. That perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved. Uh w-. You have other professional jobs. And th- this is a profession. And as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on.
sw4886.txt:Are you in the middle of anything? No. I'm not in the middle of anything. I've just. About the last thing I did. About maybe oh close to a year ago now I guess I I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house. So I guess that. The whole thing? <SEP> Yeah. That that was fairly large undertaking. A a it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house. Did the framing and all? Oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking. Huh. <SEP> That was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that. We don't we we weren't sure how to do that. And. Maybe you and I should get together. Because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing. And I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work. Yeah. That's the exact opposite. We did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up. We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work. And that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together. Ye-. <SEP> And whatever you have to put in there to get the s- to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that. Yeah. I di- we didn't know a thing about any of that. And so. My wife wishes I hadn't done that. <SEP> It's it looked very hard to do. So. <SEP> We figured well just. I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional. So we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living. But. I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Probably so. And I we'd never done it. <SEP> So we just left it alone. Yeah. But that's. I guess I'm only twenty-one. So I my my vast experience of home home owner's knowledge is not very much. So it's just what I have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents. So. Did you you framed it in f- uh on on you framed in new square footage. Or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed? <SEP> It was brand new. Brand new. We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house. So it was. A- and you knew how you knew how to do the framing? <SEP> Uh well my dad knew how to do most of it you know. Uh-huh. He he'd we'd gotten a couple of books. And then he just started doing it. I don't know. He well he did all the flooring himself. He put the whole the whole floor in. And then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there. And then we were put a like a not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that. After we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less. It's not you know it's not enclosed. It's just somewhere to drive another car to to park. And it's. Do do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground? <SEP> Uh it's off the ground. On the piers? Uh-huh. It's on about uh twenty-two inch piers something like that. Did. <SEP> You had those poured. So. Or you did them yourself? <SEP> Uh no. Those those are. We did those ourselves. So. You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete? Yeah. Huh. <SEP> Exactly. So. It's. Well the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of. Yeah. Those ar- those are. We'd I've done one. I helped somebody do one of those before. Those are those are you know. You can buy them in kits. But we didn't do that way. But it's. No. I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job. <SEP> Yeah. Those are nice. They're pretty forgiving you know. You can always tear stuff out and redo it. It's a. Yeah. Yeah. That's not near like building a house or anything. <SEP> But. Right. Yeah. Those are nice. Especially when you get done you've got something you know. I don't know. I like them. You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have a barbecue. Yeah. <SEP> I I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff. Or. I. <SEP> Yeah. That sounds nice. All done by yourself huh? Yeah. I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes. <SEP> Designed. So we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts. And uh and then the rest of it I just did. Yeah. A a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the uh foundation work. But uh it was pretty. It was about four or five hundred square feet. The same size as the addition that I just put on. So. <SEP> Yeah. That's pretty that's a good size deck. Yeah. So yeah. That's. It's uh not that expensive. I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know no less than that. <SEP> Yeah. That's not. Co- cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together. Yeah. That's good. That's not bad at all. Didn't have to. Yeah. <SEP> Th- the wood may. It got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know. To get to get good lumber it costs. I don't know about Dallas but arou- even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all. I was surprised. I'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are. It's probably more there. Well yeah. It probably comes from where you are. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That it probably does. Most. I I'm not sure. But. When I drive through that area that's all I see is pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards. <SEP> Yeah. It's nothing but woods up here down here. Yeah. <SEP> I don't I haven't I mean I haven't. I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington actually. Uh-huh. And but that was just when I was a kid. So I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore. But it's I don't know we're a college town. So that doesn't help us out any. Right. East Texas. <SEP> We have. Gas is a dollar t- dollar twelve a gallon. So that's probably about what you're paying. Huh. So. Yeah. My current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to uh you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that. So. <SEP> Yeah. That's a lot easier. You've got something going all the time.
sw4341.txt:Okay. Looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment uh. The problem I have with capital punishment is that uh uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime. But I don't think that it really actually does that. I don't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are uh are committed with a without any thought to the consequences. And they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe I shouldn't do this uh because uh I might get the gas chamber or something like that. They worry about it afterwards. And then they try and get out of it. And uh how about you? Well I think that in some cases it is warranted. Uh-huh. I do too. Yep. <SEP> And I don't. I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not. Uh-huh. Yeah. You still have to do it. I I. I mean I mean I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or. So you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then. <SEP> Well for some things. Right. I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society. <SEP> I mean you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. Right. <SEP> And then do it all over again. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I don't think that that rehabilitation is effective. Right. Have to agree with you. And I'm kind of i- in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes. But I tend to agree with you that uh we should have it. I just I don't know that it's always effective. But I guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it. It's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh. But then you know I think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know just like for example uh you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. And I don't think that would really warrant capital punishment. <SEP> Uh-huh. Huh. Do you think they should be punished at all or uh like go to prison uh. Because they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that. Uh it is to a certain extent. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I think. I don't know because. I know they put uh put them in jail sometimes I guess. Uh. I think in s-. And it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um. Uh-huh. You know now I wonder what you think about this. And uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it. But uh it used to be a long time ago I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person. And I know that uh if somebody had done something to my family I would feel that I had the right to to get revenge on them. And uh but I I don't think that's done much anywhere. That's kind of drastic punishment. <SEP> Well I think that would be kind of drastic punishment. Right. And. Might make you feel better. But. <SEP> But one thing I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance sh- should be investigated. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> But like I said if if someone is is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Because they're a danger to everybody else. Huh that's interesting. I have to uh agree with that. <SEP> But. There's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh. And uh. And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison. Right. <SEP> Right. Probably more of them then the other way around. Interesting. I don't I don't not sure. I I'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it. I'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here. Well I know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I'm in I'm from South Carolina.
sw4642.txt:I uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair. Actually uh that is really a sore spot with me. I I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving. But uh like ten years ago uh reliability of automobiles at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal. And not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea. Yeah. But uh I. <SEP> So do you have a car? Pardon? Do you have a car? Well at that time actually I had a Volkswagen Rabbit. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh it was it was a real lemon. Uh subsequently I got a uh Buick Century. And it wasn't as bad. Uh-huh. But uh last year I bought a Honda Accord. And I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance. And that is it. And it's wonderful. <SEP> Yeah. We used to have a Honda Accord. And they're good. They're really good cars. Every time I get taken to an auto repair place you know every time I go I get taken. Bad you know. Huh. Woman goes in. And they go all right we got a sucker. Let's ge- see how much money we can get out of her you know. Huh. <SEP> That's what happens every time. Huh. Uh so. So wha- what do you have? <SEP> I have a Pontiac Six Thousand. All the more reason to uh have a a Honda. Yeah. But our Honda just got old and just wore out. It was let's see eleven years old. And it just just out of it. So. No. D- so you bought a Pontiac? <SEP> Huh-uh. My hu- uh ex-husband's. This is just happened a couple of weeks ago. He's my ex-husband. But just a few months ago when he was my husband uh his father gave us this car. And everything is wrong with it. I mean the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know. Now thi-. Wha- how old is the car? Uh eighty-seven. Huh. <SEP> And he just doesn't take care of things. And but I was awarded the car. So. There is a man in my church that is a mechanic. And I can trust him. So he is trying to get you know things fixed on it. Huh. But it's just you know leak leak leak everywhere. But uh you know I hate to go into a a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not you know and charge me twice as much. The last time I took it into a repair shop. The man told me I needed a master cylinder. So I said okay. And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars. And then uh about a month later a man was looking at my car. And he asked me. You know not a man not a repair man but just a friend. And I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on. And he looked at. And he said that's not a new master cylinder. Huh. <SEP> And I didn't even know what one was. And uh he showed it to me. And it was old rusty just awful. It was no more new than nothing. So apparently it was the same one that was on there. Uh more than likely. Apparently just uh re- re- uh probably filled the the brake fluid up. And that was it. <SEP> That was it probably. It was ve-. I was so irritated. And that's happened to me more than once or twice. Jus- just just about every time I've went in somewhere. So what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service. And and you ju- can hardly find one you know. Huh. <SEP> The guy that's doing most of my my car now uh goes to my church. And that's the only reason you know I go to him because I know him. Uh-huh. And I know he will tell me the truth. Because he doesn't even charge me for for doing it. So he's not going to you know take me. Right. <SEP> I just pay for the parts. And he does it so. Well that's wonderful. Yeah. You're lucky. <SEP> Yeah. I am. So I don't know. I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all. We took our Honda to the Honda dealership. And they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car. Oh really? Yeah. And so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars. We you know they told us we just had to have one. And we bought one. We didn't no more need no new engine. Give me break you know. Huh. <SEP> So it was it was not good. And uh.
sw4626.txt:Okay. How are you? You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget? Yes. Yeah. Well i- I I I feel like uh I am from Mars. I mean I'm fifty years old. And uh I've been divorced for um eighteen years. But I've two kids and all. But I uh I I've never had a budget. And I don't uh do any planning. And I don't know. <SEP> I don't uh uh I don't have a long-term financial plan. I don't try to control my expenses. But I'm I'm glad you're a stranger. <SEP> That sounds kind of like me. But really I'm I happy I I well I'm curious how other people live. Uh so maybe we should start with you. What do you do? About the same thing. Really? <SEP> Yeah. Oh. Maybe they're going to arrest us both. I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children. And uh we live from hand to mouth. We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we due for the next month. Wow. <SEP> A couple of times we've tried some things. And they worked. But I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it. Uh-huh. The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope. Yeah. <SEP> And when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area. Uh-huh. And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent. Uh-huh. <SEP> It was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money. And we did that pretty successfully for about three months. And then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope. And in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do. Huh. The uh. I had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy-six. And uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time. And so I was willing to take a half time job to do that. And I actually did. My bank account would uh. I'd I I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month. But I I had miscalculated. I well I didn't keep a balance. It's one of the problems. <SEP> I never had to in the past. I always kept plenty of money in my checking account. But when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money I sometimes I sometimes would just. Things would get to tight. Uh and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet. And every time I uh I spent money I mean cash mostly I would uh write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But I would forget to write the things down. And it that I I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not i- i- in keeping that kind of data. I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever. <SEP> I even find now like with the automatic tellers I'll go take money out of that. Yeah. And then I forget to take that out of my checking account. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh. Yeah. So I I I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make. Uh-huh. The uh. I i- I have to say that. Let's see at this point on I don't run out of money. Uh and it uh. A- and I don't I mean. Someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have. And I I I think my strategy if if I may i- i- is to is to not spend money. I mean I don't have expensive tastes. I don't go out. I mean I buy a car. Well the last car I got rid of I'd had. It was nineteen years old. Yeah. Pe- people were embarrassed for me. I mean it was it was a good car. And. <SEP> But it was still running. Oh it was great. My my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty-five Buick. And it just wouldn't stop. Uh and it. I I just didn't feel the need for a new car. It isn't like I couldn't afford one. Uh-huh. Uh and now I mean I I don't uh. I tend to eat expensive food. I mean I don't mind buying a good steak. But for me I only do that every week or without even I mean maybe once a month. <SEP> Yeah. I mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound. You buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars. To me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that. <SEP> Not very often. But but I'm just I'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket. And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up. If you're buying I mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to. That's right. So so that's I think one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have I don't I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing. <SEP> A lot of.
sw4936.txt:Why don't you start? Oh I don't know. I uh I refinished a couple of old uh dressers that were gi- handed down. You know nice it's nice tongue and groove uh uh construction. Uh that's been I've been pretty successful with that. Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that? <SEP> What? Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing? No. I've done some other things too. Uh you know. Yeah. I've done both. <SEP> Yeah. Uh uh my wife has picked up a couple of things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture. And uh we've done it a couple of times. I guess that we've been fairly successful with those. Oh yeah. That's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it I guess. <SEP> Yeah. That's a good way to get started. Uh I have a a uh really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire. Uh-huh. And uh we stripped it all the way down and refinished it. And it turned out to be really nice uh a nice desk. Maple top I think or or something of that sort. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I I uh put together a a up rolltop desk from scratch. Oh really? You know a kit. Oh. I'm jealous. <SEP> Yeah. Still had to cut it and everything. But it was fun. Uh-huh. Yeah. I I do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking. I've built my own deck and uh things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I I've done the same. You know like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that. And uh I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too. <SEP> My I uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive. Uh-huh. And so I do have a band saw and a router and uh things like that out in the garage. But I can't say I use them very often. <SEP> Um. Yeah. I'm looking at trying to get a router right now. They're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times. Putting doors in is the time when I'm. Uh I bought myself a uh template for making mortices and doors. And that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel. <SEP> I'll bet. But I've also I've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain. Uh-huh. So I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it. And now I use it twice a year maybe. <SEP> Yeah. My br- my brother's used it a lot for making drawers. I don't know. The big. What what's your opinion of wha- what a good router is like? You know I. Uh I guess it. <SEP> Because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great. They've plastic parts and stuff. The ones that what? That you dial in on the side. Uh I have never even s- I have never even looked at one closely. Uh the the little use that I've gotten from my router I would say uh I would spend my money on the bits. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh I have a I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router. And the uh. <SEP> How strong is it? It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time. But the problem is that the uh as with. Any any time you buy a a tool with a a as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end. Don't they. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> So the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably uh I mean a a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars. And uh uh if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it. Because y- e- uh. I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself uh they won't last. And I've never had the bits sharpened. So. That's a thing to consider is to. Uh-huh. <SEP> They they really get hot don't they? Yeah. And they they dull after awhile. Especially I did some cabinets in uh ash and oak. Uh-huh. And uh that that wears a bit down. We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth. And uh routing hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast. So. <SEP> Yeah. I've cut some one by eight oak before. Boy was that fun. Right. That's uh. Big solid pieces of oak are just tough. And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right. <SEP> Well that was you know with a with a circular saw. Uh-huh. <SEP> Like oh my gosh. Right. Is this going to be fun? Yeah. Well I've used mine on treated wood. And now all my blades need sharpening. Because uh treated wood will also chew them up. <SEP> Yeah. Treated wood can really make you sick too.
sw4698.txt:Actually I've been involved in electronics a long time. Uh in computers. And I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home. Uh up until I guess maybe about a year and a half ago. Oh yeah. I got one for my son. A a Macintosh uh L C. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's a real easy to use color uh computer. And I got a very nice printer that goes along with it. And he uses it for his school work. Uh-huh. Well I've I'm currently in school. So I I've had an I B M clone I guess for a couple of years now which I've been trying continually upgrading I guess. And uh I've found I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it. And I can't really. I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis. So. Huh. <SEP> It it's pr- very essential for me. Schools have them. Uh but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school. It's very easy it's much more convenient to have one at home. Where you going to school? At Georgia Tech. I see. <SEP> Yeah. So. In engineering? Yes actually. So that explains wha- all the uh computer assignments. <SEP> Yeah. It uh. Well do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work? Um sure. I have some games of course which I play on there. And uh uh I have a program which allows me to access a uh weather data bank. So I can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby. So it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on. So. Have you do you have a computer for yourself at home? No. No. I just have one for my son. And I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. Tha-. At wo- at work uh I'm a technologist uh. And I in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming. Uh but now I find myself using the computer. Even the computer at work is primarily a uh word processing system and a communication system. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Do you use Email and like that? Yes. Emil is probably pulls down a third a- of all my time. <SEP> Yeah. It's. I I uh I have modem night computer. So I can log into the sys- the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful. But uh yeah. That's that and word processing is. While I tend to. I mean obviously I do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. Uh-huh. So it's it's really become I don't know really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember. Actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a a to do a report. Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high. So. Huh. Well I'm a old-timer. I did my Master's thesis on uh a typewriter. Oh yeah. Uh I rented an I B M Selectric. <SEP> Oh. And it was a pretty big deal. Yeah. It must have been tough. It's a little bit strange for me. I I did my Master's thesis uh last year. And I did that on a computer. And it seems like. I just can't imagine how people did it before. It must have been just so much so much work. Yeah. It uh well you know it's just it was just a completely different world then. <SEP> Yeah. So uh so yo- you used your son's Macintosh then? Do you do you find it do you like that kind of computer? I like it. Yeah. I like it from a distance really. I I see the packages on it uh that are available. And it's nice. I really don't use it myself. Uh-huh. Uh I when I come home from work I I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things. <SEP> Yeah. Huh. Uh so I let my son do it. And Uh of course you know there's uh there's an intellectual evolution taking place where. <SEP> Yeah. It's sort of a joke. But it's really true. The old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot. And the kids they just take to it like candy. Yeah. Well i- if if if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge.
sw4618.txt:Go ahead. Uh have you every been tested for a new job or anything? Uh no. I haven't. But in my job I'm a nurse and we are allowed to be. I mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime. Uh I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested. <SEP> So it's just sort of uh. They can if they. They can if they choose to. Oh okay. Right. Have you well wai- have you had any experience with it at all? <SEP> Uh not really. But I've always worked on a university level. But a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff. Uh-huh. So what do you think about that? Uh I don't I don't think they're very accurate. Because I mean I know their lifestyles changed p- prior to the drug test. And I know they changed afterwards. Right. Right. See I know of that too. And I also know that things like antihistamines Sudafeds things like that can really throw it off. And you can not get a job because of it. And they may not tell you the reason why. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I I had a friend. It didn't cause her any problems with her job. But it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen. But what it was was she had been u- she had been uh in the jungle. And it was some Malaria medication. And she tested positive for that. See and so it really is a dangerous thing that way. Because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job. And they weren't told why. But a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing. Or they would tell you. Or this person never use any drugs. <SEP> See I always. I thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests. Uh you should. Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something. I have real mixed feelings about it. I don't know. How do you know how wrong they are? Are they I mean is there a margin of error? The accuracy? I don't know. I don't know. But I know there are a lot of things that can influence them. And I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time. <SEP> Yeah. And if you could show that. I I interviewed for a job recently. And I was taking Entex. And my doctor gave me a prescription for it. Uh-huh. And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know. And it didn't come up that I needed to do it. But this could happen to anybody. And if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. <SEP> And I I'm not so sure they are that needed. Yeah. I'm not sure either. I mean Ye-. The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it. Because they say they can spot check. <SEP> If you're using it while at a job I can see a problem. Yeah. But the occasional person then it's almost like it's almost an infringement of your privacy. Well it sort of is. And this is it. This. I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways. You know as a health professional I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs. <SEP> Yeah. You know so as a patient I feel well yeah we probably should be protected. But on the other hand there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too. So you know I guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way. Yeah. You can't go around testing everybody for everything. <SEP> Yeah. So I don't know. And I I think it could be used to hassle somebody. If someone was out to get you I think that a company or a boss could use this. You know they could keep on doing this to you or something I guess. I can see where it could become a problem. And it it's like it seems like now they have tests. I guess they can test your hair. And they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago. Really. <SEP> Oh wow ! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. So. <SEP> I know. That's the other thing. I mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on. And I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. Yeah. There's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult. Yeah. <SEP> But you can't say it was wrong at the time. I think that's true. Yeah. Yeah. So that probably wouldn't be too good either.
sw4312.txt:So what kind of music you into? Well I have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music. In fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that I don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal. The opera yeah it's right on track. I like classical. But I can't deal with opera at all. <SEP> And heavy metal uh it's noisy. I'm into uh some industrial music that's a a bit even harder than that. Uh-huh. But it's it's got to have a point to it. <SEP> Oh I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to. But uh the the uh basic point of heavy metal w- which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying. <SEP> Yeah. What kind of progressive stuff? <SEP> Uh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh oh you know. I'm thirty. So lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and R E M that sort of stuff. Uh. Uh R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point. And it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of people l- like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think that's pretty much you know bull. Because R E M really hasn't changed. If it's it's interesting. They're producing uh similar music. And it's good music. <SEP> Uh-huh. But you know people have picked up on it. That's good. <SEP> I think it is. I'm impressed. Uh for a while there music seemed to really ha- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it. I was really tired of uh the Michael Bolton. <SEP> Mi- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes. Oh yeah. <SEP> And I could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money. Uh but he picked the right songs. And and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has for that matter. I guess. <SEP> That and a marvelous hairdo. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm sure that that so- that sold a lot for him. That's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop. I'm ki- I've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop. <SEP> It just seems like there's no no real point. You hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises. Uh-huh. And. <SEP> Well i- it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music. Uh-huh. And I like a lot of classical music. But I also dislike uh some classical music. And what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time. <SEP> Yeah. I can I can believe that. What kind of things are you do you like in classical? What's the standard? Uh. <SEP> Stuff that I like. Uh I like Bach. I tolerate Vivaldi. I can't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy. <SEP> Uh uh I like Tchaikovsky. He can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined. Oh yes. Uh and some of some stuff that I like uh. For instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's interesting music. But it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive. <SEP> You know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth. That's right you know. W- we'll do we'll do the ninth. And everyone will know it and and hum it. It's safe. <SEP> And i- it it just isn't chance taking enough for me. Uh I feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times.
sw4876.txt:Well I haven't had an awful lot of uh incidents regarding child care. When my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek. And uh but uh that's about the the uh the extent of it. But but but when. I really am a- am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I and I and I'm saying to myself well you know y- you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place. And they don't pay very much. And w- why why would they be interested in in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know. Uh-huh. And uh that's a terrible kind of thing. And I don't think my children have ever been subject to that. But my wife didn't work. And so we really didn't have that much exposure to it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well I am a working mother. I have three children. And my children since I uh since they were very young. I've had various um different alternatives child care arrangements. And like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel uh in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home. And my kids I think are very very secure well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities. Huh. So I I I e-. You know it is a problem. And but as you pointed out I I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities. And that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford. When our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful. Huh. <SEP> And then as they got older they went to uh I preferred to call them schools. And they were really all day preschools. And they were wonderful. And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things. Oh well that's interesting. But we did we really truly did pay a fortune. I mean we were paying at one point well about about a close about five hundred dollars a week for two children. Oh my God. <SEP> So. Well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that. Well I mus-. I'm a physician. Uh and as is my husband. Oh well yeah. <SEP> And and I felt uh very good about working. I'm a pediatrician actually. Uh-huh. So uh but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children. But and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think. Well not not all of us. You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for. <SEP> I'm an engineer. Oh. Well. And. <SEP> I think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. And we had a really wonderful arrangement uh. I'm with the university actually. Uh-huh. And they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three. And it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. And so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. And they had wonderful. They had things like gardens and lots of pets. And just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio. Yeah. <SEP> So that that sort of an. Most of the teachers had degrees. Uh. Five hundred dollars a week. For two kids. Yeah. That's incredible. <SEP> It was incredible actually. Oh oh. But it was good. I mean it was it. At that time there were two children. And they were in special programs. And each one was a little over two hundred a week. And then in addition I paid a little bit extra. But the kids were. Well. <SEP> I mean they really had some great opportunities. But tha-. W-. What you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage an- and and really have t- feel they have to put their children. Yeah. <SEP> Sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying sit- situations. You know. They could. Somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare. And you know that's a good starting wage. <SEP> Uh-huh. But boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care. Uh-huh. <SEP> No. Even that that really I think I don't. It's been awhile since I've looked at. My youngest child is eight. So it's been a little while since I've looked into actually daycare centers. But they are. Huh. You know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since. I mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit. But mi- mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven. So you know that. <SEP> Uh-huh. I guess baby-sitters now are up at what five dollars an hour? Something like that. Oh my. <SEP> Well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children. I mean it has been a real uh. Th- there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences. And I think I think they have captured a certain market. Again the. But then there are baby-sitting groups. As a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections. Uh-huh. As you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around. Oh yeah.
sw4728.txt:I don't know what you drive now. I mean what do you drive now? Uh I have a Ford pickup. And uh the family car is a uh a Dodge Caravan. And uh because we have three kids and they're under thirteen. Oh okay. <SEP> So uh. Throw them in the back. They sort of fit our requirement. Yeah. I have a one of those uh pickups with the uh seat with a seat in the back. Cab. <SEP> Oh yeah? And so they just fit in there. When they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work. Yeah. <SEP> Right now I can right now I can throw them all in the back when we have room. And uh and since I do a lot of projects I throw things in the back. There you go. And I kind of like having a pickup truck. Yeah. Yo-. <SEP> Actually I think of it as a as a car that'll last. Right. Yeah. I know. I like the way trucks are built. And I don't care about comfort. So I'm pretty happy. Yeah. You're looking at. I got a Toyota Four Runner. I wanted a truck that I I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too. So I got a Four Runner. <SEP> So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one. I I never buy new. So I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck. You're just like me. I've never bought a new vehicle in my life. And uh yeah. I don't I don't need to pay for the glitz. I'll let somebody else uh have the showroom shine. No. <SEP> And I'll pay for the rest of it. Let somebody else break it in. Right. Right. And uh the van we're sor-. We might go again on a on a van. We we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time. I'm not sure. Yeah. <SEP> We have to we we'll have to face it in a couple of years. But uh I I guess we had a small Toyota wagon. Right. <SEP> And we were real happy with that because uh my my second requirement after price is uh low maintenance. Right. And uh th- it certainly had that. We didn't do much to it at all. Yeah. <SEP> So. Yeah. My my. Pretty much the same. I I got a like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners. Uh-huh. And uh it pretty much does everything I need it to. I mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds. So I can tow everything. And it. I can throw. I've had eleven people in it before. Believe it or not. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh it's real reliable. Belie-. I I mean I've had it for almost four years now. And up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it. Uh-huh. And then of course two weeks ago it decided. <SEP> I don't know. It's the strangest weirdest thing in the world. But it blew a head gasket. Uh-oh. Didn't do any damage to it. Uh I caught it real early. <SEP> How. At how at how many miles? Uh oh ninety-seven thousand. <SEP> Huh. So it's not real early. You didn't overheat it? No. Never overheated it. I smell I smelled the uh I smelled the coolant. <SEP> Uh-huh. Went out and looked. Saw it was saw where it was coming from. Drove it right to the shop and left it off. Huh. Well that was. And that was it. Because I d- I have that. And then I have a a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I mean that's that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle. <SEP> It it's a. I don't know. People who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves. I have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it's not raining. And uh uh he's a. It's. He's pretty conservative guy. I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess uh. I know. But I bet you he really enjoys riding it. <SEP> I'm sure he does. Yeah. Yeah. So you know yo-. H-. When was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving? <SEP> Yeah. No. And I go out twice a week on the bike so. At least. Just for the enjoyment. <SEP> Yeah. Uh. <SEP> Yeah. But yeah. I I mean the only thing I think I might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car. Uh I would consider going to a a non to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had ju- just an open bed to throw stuff in. Right. I'm sure I'm sure that that's very. I mean you got one. It's that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back. And. <SEP> If I only had some place that I could store the uh camper top I would have it off most of the time. Right. I really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty. To have it out of the way. Right. <SEP> But uh they're solid. Uh trucks are built uh I mean. I think they last a lot longer than anything else. They're the only things Americans still know how to build. And uh. Yeah. Yeah. The trucks do. Uh even though you know the Jap the little Jap trucks are are good there too. But so are the. Though I think the Chevies. I don't think the Che-. I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords. <SEP> Yeah. I think they I think the Fords tend to last a little longer. At least until recently. Right. I I kind of like mine. <SEP> Yeah. So mine's a Ford. A friend of mine just bought bought like a year ago. It it's a really nice truck. I mean I don't like Dodges at all. But one of the Dodges they have out now has a uh the Cummins turbo diesel on it. Oh I heard about that. Yes. Oh it's beautiful. <SEP> Yeah. That thing that thing will last forever I mean. That that's a serious truck. Oh yeah. That thing's uh. It's got a boat engine in it. <SEP> Right. This uh. I I know a contractor who just got one of those. Uh-huh. He's pleased with it.
sw4565.txt:I. You know actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many convenience appliances and whatnot. We don't even have to cook dinner anymore. Yes. Yeah. Really. Uh but I uh I've heard I don't know this for a fact but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together. <SEP> That ki- the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents. That's what I've heard too. Uh. It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it although I think probably the the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television. <SEP> Yeah. Not so much because uh it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming. And I thin- there's also some uh I think uh poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time. Right. It's so darned easy to turn the thing on. <SEP> I know it. I've I tell myself sometimes just sit down after work. So I refuse to have one in the house. Oh really? Yeah. <SEP> Well good for you. Good for you. A lot of people I talk to a lot of people about that. And I've thought about it myself. And I though about it a lot. Uh-huh. But uh I still haven't done it yet. Well that's good. Well I'll tell you. Television sure makes child rearing easy on you. I mean the kids can be a real pest uh. And turning the T V on is almost like magic you know. It's like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center. And you don't have to worry about them. <SEP> That's true. I've noticed that. But I don't think it's too good. I don't think so either. Uh so you know I don't know. I take advantage. I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids. But I take advantage of um dinner time. We always eat together. And you know whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them. <SEP> Do you keep your kids uh active in sports or anything. Or. Uh I guess our big outlet is music. Uh. Oh okay. Our thirteen year old son plays violin. And our nine year old daughter plays cello. <SEP> Okay. And uh when our son started playing violin I took up violin. And when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello. <SEP> So there's plenty of plenty of interactive time in uh practicing. Although neither kid likes to practice. I guess that's not a big surprise. <SEP> No. Not for kids. But I mea- I imagine with infants you are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them. Although. Yeah. Well I I try and read to them. <SEP> And I take them to the park and stuff. And Yeah. Oh you know reading is so good. I uh I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little. And I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore. <SEP> Yeah. Well they get to that stage. Uh but I read you know. There's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book. Have you ever seen that yet? Sleep book. No. Yeah. It's called a sleep book. And uh you ought to get it. I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized. <SEP> Uh. We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books. Yeah. Well I think I think his sleep book is my favorite. <SEP> Oh really? Uh-huh. Well yeah. I like to I like to do it. And they enjoy reading. I've actually I never read a lot growing up. And I never read until a few years ago. I just started picking up books. And so I've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read. To I like to get away in a book you know? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and. Uh-huh. So how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day? <SEP> Oh I probably spend an hour or two. Oh that's great. My wife works at night. So she does uh Tupperware. So she's gone a lot at nights. And so I spend a lot of time with them. Oh I see. <SEP> Ho- how old are your kids again? They're two and one. Two and one. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. So you have your hands full with them. That's for sure. Yeah.
sw4316.txt:Do you think that there's any way that uh. Or do you think there's too much crime now? I mean I guess any crime is too much. But It's out of control. <SEP> Uh yeah. Yeah. Uh well uh out of control I don't know. I guess it could be worse. Uh we've uh we've we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood. Uh I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington. Uh there's uh there's a lot of problems. I mean there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people. And uh you know we get c- cars on our block uh regularly uh uh g- uh gone through rifled through and stuff. Really? <SEP> Yeah. I would not of okay I would not have guessed that in Seattle. Yeah. You figured it was like Omaha right? Yeah. <SEP> You know. No. It's uh it's not Newark. But uh yeah. It's got problems. Yeah. I wonder I mean I wonder what what really is the answer. I mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system. <SEP> Yeah. I think most people regard it as a warehouse. Where you put away the people that are so bad that uh you don't want them out in circulation. Yeah. But but the problem is is that we we only have but so much room. And we we try to put aside in the warehouse. And all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes. <SEP> Yeah. And. That's what I hear. So it's uh. <SEP> Yeah. I I think you know. Don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea? I get the feeling that a lot of people have. I'm not convinced that I have. Yeah. Uh see I mean my mom taught English as a second language. And and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes. And uh. <SEP> Oh you mean she taught in a prison? Yes. Oh. In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia. <SEP> I see. Uh. And the problem she had was not with the inmates at all. The the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison. <SEP> I mean It was it was I mean. Yeah. The b- the bureaucracy. They they put her I mean. I didn't obviously I didn't see the classroom uh and hopefully never will. But uh they they put her at the end of a hallway. <SEP> There were no other classes going on at the time. And they refused to let her wear a body al- a body alarm. Which. Uh. And. I don't know exactly what that is. But I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people. <SEP> Yeah. But uh you know. So she didn't feel safe. No. She didn't. She didn't. She she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates. And then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse. And uh she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around. <SEP> Yeah. But well she had decided that it was when we came back to the States she decided that it was too. She didn't feel that public schools were s- were safe. So next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison. Yeah. Right. But uh. <SEP> Well at least it's maximum security right. Yeah. But but the point that was that it you know. You said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible. And and I'm I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it. Uh well I I think the people that run yeah that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical you know. Uh. <SEP> I mean I uh you know I I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff. And it's uh. You can get pretty hardened I'm sure. But getting I mean well see. I always have problems because because I can never decide whether or not I'm I'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal. But. Yeah. Right. But I keep I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is circumstances. <SEP> Those are funny labels see. I mean I can't help but wonder if if I grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison at this point? Oh yeah. <SEP> Oh Oh yeah. Absolutely. I think uh yeah I think you can blame it on social problems. Sure. I mean I don't know. <SEP> I mean as as you know as poverty has gotten worse as you know education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's m- been more crime. We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program. Yeah. There's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse. <SEP> And yep. It's a mess. I don't I don't remember the the gentleman's name. But the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a is a Rhodes Scholar. And what he. Is he the guy wants to like deregulate heroin or something? Well what he wants to do is take all the money that uh he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education. <SEP> Uh-huh. And basically just just attack the problem at the demand side. Uh-huh. Stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't. I mean Switzerland tried the the grand experiment. And you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park. And.
sw4831.txt:See wh- when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good. And and you know the pay is regular. But uh you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on. And I I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that anybody could get in in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on. And maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do. What's what's your feeling about benefits? What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company. Well since I'm kind of on the the older side you know I I I just feel like uh when I start talking about benefits I talk about I'm concerned about medical benefits. Uh my uh my husband works for McDonald Douglas. And so his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know. That's really great. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know I work for uh Wes- a bank Western Financial. Uh-huh. And uh they don't let me know really about anything that's going on. Even some of the immediate things that I need to know I don't know it until the next hour. And all of a sudden we know we've got changes made. We're changing departments. We're changing policies. We're changing doing other kinds of things. Which to me is is disturbing. I mean I feel like if I I don't necessarily need to uh be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level. You are you are right there. You know I'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh the company is concerned. But I I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening. And I think I can be a better and more effective employee if if I had a little bit more information along that line. Well th-. I I well I work for the government. <SEP> And uh actually I work for the F B I. Oh my gosh. And uh and so you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told. For good reason. But uh but basically uh there's lots of things that that we should know about projects. I'm an engineer. You know. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm I'm a COTR. And sometim-. And I I worked in the same lab with a guy. And we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years. And we should have. You know we're we're now collaborating. Oh. And. <SEP> And it it. For two years we didn't. And we which was a kind of stupid. But uh but our organization is doing something else t- on Monday. Uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways. And every all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do. Which I thought was kind of interesting and But uh but that that sort sort of thing. Yeah. That is interesting. <SEP> But if you I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on. Exactly. And and but of course most time most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know. And you know if you don't really count. If you're not part of the program you might not get told for months. Or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly. Or if your management doesn't think that. But but regard to benefits. You know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing. In the private sector I would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid-fifties wa- is keeping a job until you retire. <SEP> A-. Right. And engineers are uh are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies. And uh it's very much like the military. It windows out. You know you you think well boy I'm getting more money. And I'm getting more responsibility. I'm doing this. But as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree. Uh-huh. And pretty soon somebody falls off. I I've fallen off twice in the private sector. <SEP> Oh. And uh and you know I can get up. I know. It it seems to be be kind of kind of scary you know. Because you think of. Uh see my son's eighteen right now. And he he's uh he wants to go into engineering. And the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open. And he's interested in basically three different areas. But uh it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that. He needs to do his own course of investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical. I mean my uh brother-in-law is like uh I mean he's sixty. He's not ready to retire. But his company is is uh is uh closing up. Uh-huh. And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff. And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on. He's getting cut back. And he's not ready to retire. Yeah. He may be retired.
sw4859.txt:Okay. Uh generally I get uh you know most of my news uh in the you know weekly magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK and and uh U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. With with occasional smatterings of of uh you know THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and of course the local paper. Uh-huh. But uh my my only complaint is I really don't enough time to to look at the articles every day and and go through a paper you know exhaust the details. So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. <SEP> Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? Well yes. I I well I I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article. Uh-huh. And and so I I I like the weekly magazines uh because i- it gives me you know the high points of what's going on. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh but many times uh you know the the local uh the local news kind of suffers you know. But here I am you know cheek by jowl with our nation's capital. And. Oh that's right. You're very close actually. It's almost a uh bedroom community for the capital. Yeah. <SEP> Yes. E- exactly. Well when when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself hey guys I'm inside the beltway. <SEP> But uh i- it turns out that uh that that the C N N is I think is great. And for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events. Uh-huh. But generally they're they're they're more sound bitish you know kind of thing. And and I don't really uh you know I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient uh you know dose of news that way. <SEP> Yeah. A lot of my information comes from several sources. Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio. Uh which I like. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yes. Uh I I think it's fairly objective. And I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative. And while there's an inherent uh filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read uh I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of uh favoring the other side. That's that's potential indication of balance. And generally I really do believe they are pretty balanced. Uh I also read TIME magazine. And we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the uh various uh of the articles and the front section. And uh. Well the MERCURY and the and the and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really can stand up there. <SEP> Oh. Oh you st-. Did you use to live around here? Uh Redwood City. I use to work at Anteks. <SEP> Oh okay. Oh yeah. Okay. I know exactly where that is. Anteks Amdahl and places like that. Yeah. We we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper. Yeah. <SEP> A-. The newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times i- at well the LOS ANGELES TIMES. Which I've found to be a uh a very good quality uh newspaper. Uh-huh. And I like a lot of the articles there. Th- the other thing when you said we don't have cable T V so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is is called C SPAN. Yes. I I've I enjoy. See they have uh we have two the both C SPANS here. But but really the th- on the public T V you know MACNEIL LEHRER is one is an hour's program that I always. <SEP> Both? Uh-huh. If if I watch any news program it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. And and occasionally C SPAN. <SEP> Uh-huh. I I like a I saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust. Was the whole thing was was run on that. And and and a- also they have the uh the uh uh PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD. Oh I never say that. That would have been interesting. It. <SEP> Yeah. I I think that's always fascinating. I wish I wish we had something. When wh- when it first uh you know when it first tuned in on that I you know. It's one that's. I think it was somebody was just scarcely just just ripping the hell out of someo- another person. And I. And everybody was you know making noise in the background. And then Yeah. <SEP> But it's usually the Prime Minister. Right? Here's this dude in a wig. Thatcher. Major. And I said to myself it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about. <SEP> And then and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench. And I said oh it's Parliament. Which could be another of Monty Python. Yeah. So I I thought to myself I can't wait. I'm going over to to Britain in mid you know in mid-May. I I I'm going to uh you know a- you know apr- approach my uh you know. This is how I discovered you know the que- the Prime Minister's you know question and answer period you know. P-. <SEP> I I have seen that. And uh a aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in American politics uh which I really enjoy. I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions I think. And it's unlike the fairly controlled uh press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they they always seem. Yeah.
sw4329.txt:Okay. So I guess it starts recording now. Okay. Okay. I don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in. We live in the Saginaw area. <SEP> Saginaw? Uh-huh. And I'm not real familiar with uh anything that. I. Fact as far as I know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. And uh or the grocery store or anything in this area. Really? Yeah. <SEP> The rec-. We live in Plano. And they started off recycling by uh putting the. I think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now. I guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans. And uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now. And you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum. Uh-huh. And you set it out. And they pick it up. And it it works real neat. They seem to be having a real good response. Really? <SEP> So. That is pretty good. I'm we're originally from another state. And I know in the state we were from that they did that t- similar type thing. The city brought ought you know set tr- separate trash cans. And you separated your stuff. And you put it in there. And they took it you know. Did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for for cans. I don't really know. <SEP> Even or. I don't really know. They they started after we moved down here. And so I I'm not really familiar. Yeah. I just know that uh my in-laws up in up in Oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up. But I don't know if they get a get anything back on it. Or do you get money for it? <SEP> No. I just I noticed it. Iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can. Oh. So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles. Really. <SEP> You know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to I guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in. Right. <SEP> I n- I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel. Right. And now now most of them are throwaway. Right. <SEP> So maybe that's one thing they can do. I think now they're a lot more expensive than that. Uh I bought some Cokes the other day in the br- the little bottles you know. Uh-huh. And I think the bottles were like I know they were at least ten cents apiece. I started to see at home. I was like God how much were those bottles you know? <SEP> Yes. And it was they come in like uh eight and and eight and ten packs you know instead of six packs. Right. And uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles. You know I was like God Almighty. It costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes. <SEP> That was my brother's first job in a grocery store. He was in the bottle area. In the bot-. It's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over. But but it's uh it's quite. Right. <SEP> They say that the green glass now that there's a big glut of green the green glass. Oh really? Of green glass. <SEP> Yeah. It's amazing. Well out in this area they really don't have anything. Now I know that like Minyard's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front. Uh different colors for different things and and things like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But I I do know some of these places were doing that. And they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them. Right. <SEP> Yeah. It's. I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs. Yeah. It it's. People just. They they really don't. Uh there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff. Yeah. More than it's worth. <SEP> It's. I don't know. It it can be. It's not as easy selecting you know clean junk as they say. Right. Well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away. <SEP> That's right. That's right. It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. Right. Uh yeah. We all do it. <SEP> Well it was nice talking to you. It was nice talking to you. I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything. Oh I think I think two or three minutes is fine. I-. <SEP> Is that it? Yeah. Okay. Well it was nice talking to you. And I I guess I'll do this for I was doing this for actually I was going to do it for my son so that he could uh he he's in high school so that he could make some money. <SEP> Right. Uh but then it has my name on it. So I'm like okay. I'll sit down here and call it. Well we're doing it for a church choir. So. Oh are you? <SEP> Yeah. Oh that's interesting. So. That's nice. Well. <SEP> Well thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.
sw4358.txt:Okay. What is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling? Uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup. Uh-huh. Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts. Some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect. And they do have bins set up. But I live in a a metropolitan area. And uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that. <SEP> Well here they and. Uh live in an apartment complex. Uh-huh. And they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins. I I know a lot I think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort. Whether. And and I think that and I know Massachusetts has. A bottle bill was passed. And we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now. And the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh. That's the majority of people that I know of anyways. Where people aren't really you know eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do. And I'm not going to throw a bottle away. It's like throwing a nickel away. That type of thing. <SEP> Right. They Th- here they're trying to push through a bill. But uh people need to be more conscious of it. And a lot of people are against it. And it's going to create a lot more work for the uh the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff. Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything. Yeah. It didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. Uh and and matter of fact I think it took like three tries t- for it to go through. But and it's been pretty successful. And people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know. People would dr- have a drink of soda. Instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle. So it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth. But more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing. And that's the big thing I think that th- they try to promote. <SEP> Right. I think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate. Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. <SEP> Th- there definitely has to be a motivation factor. And I know that at w- where I work. I work for a defense contractor. And there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh Styrofoam usage because of the uh the process involved in Styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that. And and they're very proactive. And uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh Styrofoam stuff. So. So i- i- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it. I think that's that's what they need to do. Be more proactive like that. Uh I know uh I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books. Uh usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones. Usually just get dumped out with the trash. And phone books are a large volume of annual trash. Yeah. They they just. Matter of fact that that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa-. The local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school. And what they'll do is they'll recycle it. Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time. A guy went to a d- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty. Because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time. <SEP> Well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper. Yeah. They contain the glue and stuff. And they used to have to take out all the uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them. Yeah. <SEP> Now I think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out. Yeah. Okay.
sw4796.txt:Okay Randall uh uh. Do you have any special interest in uh space flight? Oh yeah. Ever since I was a young and uh used to watch the old uh Apollo missions going off in uh classroom T V -s. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off. Uh-huh. Uh very exciting. Yeah. <SEP> The uh uh. I've al- I've always uh w- wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that. And uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen. Uh-huh. Of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately. What do you do now? Uh computer programmer. Oh. <SEP> Unfortunately that can be done from the ground. Yeah. To bad huh. Yeah. Made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space. <SEP> The uh uh. I used to think when I was when I was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh frustrating at times. Uh-huh. <SEP> I don't know what you think about all that. Well uh yo- I uh I'm kind of young. I'm only twenty-two. And so uh uh I'm not you know. There's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all. Although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties. Uh-huh. Uh although I have a. I I kind of wonder uh if some if it were possible to market some uh form of uh space technology you know to uh uh to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the uh respect that you know there's endless amounts of research to be done. Endless amounts of resources and and whatnot. <SEP> Yeah. It would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy. Well Yeah. <SEP> Well the uh uh. I've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up. Uh-huh. Uh because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact. Exactly. <SEP> And you can just get as much power as you need up there. Uh-huh. It's just a matter of how big you build it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing. So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good you know very very good for al- for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also. So I'm. Right. Yeah. It seems like uh there's. So you're talking about positive side effects then. Yeah. Right. Okay. I understand. <SEP> Right. Uh Right. Sure. That makes a lot of sense. The only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And they want to do the research. And uh they're all you know nor-. Yeah. <SEP> The only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to Mars. Which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth. Right. Exactly. But the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and you know so forth. Uh-huh. <SEP> It it would de- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of instead of for you know. Uh-huh. We should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so. Right. <SEP> We should do it because for for the return we get for it. Uh-huh. And uh unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened. Exactly. Least not. <SEP> I I would settle for the gli- for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the uh. But uh. Yeah. The downside of that is you after you do one of those people say well we did it. Right. <SEP> Now let's now we're done. Now we're done. <SEP> No need to use this anymo- to play around with this space stuff anymore. That's what happened with Apollo. Uh But uh I'd give almost anything to get into space. Yeah. I think you're right. I would too. I'd I'd uh. Was it John Denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle?
sw4628.txt:Wha- what sort of company do you work for? Do you work for a big or a little place? Uh I work for Georgia Tech. Yes sir. I work for the research facility. Uh and it's it's kind of small in a sense. But it it does have about uh I guess two thousand civil employees. Uh-huh. <SEP> And on a a scale I guess it's still considered small. It just have a lot of different laboratories. Uh-huh. The area I work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so. Uh-huh. <SEP> So that's make up most of the laboratory. So from from that standpoint it's pretty small it's pretty small. Uh-huh. What about yourself? Huh. Well I I work for uh actually probably similar kind of place. I work for uh Lincoln Laboratory. <SEP> Oh okay. Uh yeah. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech. Oh okay. I see. Uh and uh. So we're we're part we're actually part of M I T. So it's very much the same kind of place and uh the technical institution. <SEP> Oh okay. Right. Uh. Uh while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a and a job. I guess uh list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. I don't know. What are your uh what sorts of things would you consider important? <SEP> Well those and probably the security aspect of it. Uh-huh. Because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working uh you're treated. And it may not be true in every place. In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a a person. Uh-huh. <SEP> Because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and and you know their well being as far as you know how they going their next dollar going to come in. How they going to pay their bills. They just lay them off. Yeah. And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had uh. I think the company still exists. What they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> That way that you know one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time. Uh-huh. And uh you know I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better you know other than s- you know something like. Unemployment is good. But I mean the company as a whole. Because you as an employee even the company is making money. They paying you a salary. But you are responsible for that company growth. You're responsible also for helping that company get to the par- point that it's at at making profits. So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than you know uh neglect or something like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know. Because it's not a person's fault that you know people not buying or businesses are are not on the up and up all the time you know. I don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of com- a company situation. Now how do you mean that? I know it. Well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. Uh for the bad times of the company. Uh-huh. <SEP> What about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well. Uh-huh. You know. In that standpoint. Well you you think it's better than to to try to spread the the effort equally among all the employees of the company. Or. <SEP> Ye- yes. I do. Uh-huh. I really do. I think it'd be better that way. And even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that that there are problems. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you know there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know. That's just that's my views you know. Yeah. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. I think uh back about a few years ago when things were tough Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. They went to a uh a a four and a half day work week rather than cut yeah just cut everybody back ten percent. And uh have to give everybody a half day a week off. Right. <SEP> Right. Right. And I think you can do that for a little while. But I'm. <SEP> Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know. Because the way it is a person really don't have a chance. Yeah.
sw4311.txt:Go ahead. Oh okay. Yeah. The uh subject is child care and how to determine child care. And that's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children. But I did run a child care facility for a while. Um. <SEP> And uh have some. Well you should you should have some opinions on that then. I do have some thoughts on that. Yeah. Uh it's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or parent for a lot of people there. And uh it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities. Well I guess if I were going to choose I mean my first consideration would be safety. <SEP> Right. My second consideration would be uh uh health. Right. And uh I guess my third consideration would be uh warm environment warm personal environment. <SEP> <SEP> Well right. Uh in Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level. So you meet the standards. But then after that there's there's a lot more. I think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people uh in terms of not just just. Because somebody has a child or uh likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that uh. Oh absolutely. As a matter of fact I believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children. <SEP> Exactly. And that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people. And it's the most difficult of all for a parent judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving. Oh. But if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are. <SEP> Oh exactly. And the other thing that's difficult in uh it's a too small setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't want to just warehouse the child. And I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important. And you have to have the right kind of enrichment. And that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe and and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for. But also his uh developmental needs are cared for too. Maybe the right thing to do is to uh when a couple has a child then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and I think I would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting. That would be lovely. Get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then uh and then of course to make up for that uh the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer you know. In other words they probably would not work may not en- may end up not working at all d- in the twenties. Uh. Well that's an interesting thought because. But then they have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety. <SEP> That would be okay. That would that would help on the other end too in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be. Right. Well you know the uh uh the world is changing f- uh from instit- from uh industrial uh base to uh information base. And so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's exactly right. All you have to do is have a sharp mind. And I believe that uh mental acuity is easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind. <SEP> Oh. So I think a person could work uh into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter. If they didn't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could main- maintain uh.
sw4801.txt:What do you think about capital punishment? Well I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes. Yeah. Which crimes do you feel that? <SEP> Well I think first degree murder uh probably warrants it. Yeah. Because of. So many times it's so brutal and just recurrent. Right. Selling I think should also. <SEP> Exactly. Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever. Yeah. I come from a state that has well I originally come from the state that has uh the death penalty. I come from Florida. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh they're pretty liberal on it. They tend to like fry people left and right. Which. Yeah. That's. Go ahead. Go ahead. Texas is too. Texas I saw on T V the other night is the has had forty-six in like the past several years. <SEP> Yeah. So they're pretty hip on it too I guess. They do it by lethal injection at Huntsville. Yeah. Okay. I think Florida still uses electric chair. Yeah. <SEP> Uh I don't I don't know. In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God. Yeah. And that's not. I don't think that's right. But on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it. Yeah. <SEP> I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it. And of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. Um. Yeah. With Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year. They. Yeah. That's what's happening here. There is. Like uh that's. In fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of uh r- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again. <SEP> Uh-huh. Sure. And it's like you know that's a big problem. But there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's really you know it's it gets to be a r- a big problem. Yeah. Uh go ahead. I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't. <SEP> Right. Be a little more you know. Not being able to put it off for fifteen years. Uh-huh. Yeah. Because a lot of these guys you know they get in. And they they get off for good behavior. And I don't know. Up in Minnesota where I am now they don't have the death penalty. And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know. Because they figure well you know sure I I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something. Uh but then for. If I if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten. Oh really? <SEP> Oh sure you know. Goodness. I mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails uh you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head uh. I don't know. I think that may solve a lot of that. Yeah. <SEP> Maybe not solve it. But I don't know. Maybe. I yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient. Yeah. Uh kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty. <SEP> Uh-huh. What do you do Georgeanne? I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas. Oh okay. Great. What program you in? Uh audiology. <SEP> Okay. Fantastic. Uh. Yeah. What do you do? I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida. Oh really. <SEP> Yeah. I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell. Oh really? Uh yeah. Neat. <SEP> But uh I don't know. It's it's an interesting issue. There's like you say in Texas there's been quite a few. And and in Florida in the last few years I think there's been a lot. I can't I you know I can't give you figures. But uh. Yeah. I just. This was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California. Uh-huh. So I think it. The forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what. <SEP> Oh is that right? They gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then. Okay. <SEP> Yeah. I I kind of. Yeah I've heard things about that. I've heard that they don't mess around very much. Yeah. Uh they they don't get repealed as easily as they do. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like the guy in California got thir- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber. And then they said okay no. You don't have to go. And then they took him back. I mean it just seems Yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent. Jeez. That's a lot of repeals. And then you have like two. You have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I don't know. I I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it. Uh I guess. What is it what's the policy now with treason? Do they uh do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? No. I don't I don't think uh the military doesn't execute anymore. So. <SEP> Yeah. Or death before the firing squad or whatever. Yeah. So I think about the only one is uh rape.
sw4363.txt:Wh- what's your uh. Uh. Are you into the Cowboys? <SEP> Oh God no. Uh no. I'm not. I haven't been. I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a Cowboys' man. I like Philadelphia Eagles. Oh yeah? <SEP> Yeah. Well that that's all right. That's my favorite team. So. <SEP> Uh now that Randall's coming back next season I hope they'll be do a little bit better. They didn't do too bad last season. Yeah. But I hope they can do better. How about yourself? Well I don't know. I kind of go back and forth uh depending on who's really hot and who's not. I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh I guess if I have uh my druthers I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks. Oh tha-. I kind of like them. <SEP> Yeah. That's another one of my favorites. Yeah. They're kind of. They're not they're not my favorite totally. But I do like them. I like. Yeah. Yo-. <SEP> Seahawks are good. They. Now that Steve Largent is gone I kind of lose a little bit for them. But you know he. Yeah. To be honest with you I I probably watch uh college a little bit more than I do pro. <SEP> Really? Yeah. Huh. I kind of like college actually. Quite a bit. <SEP> Yeah. That's kind of that's kind of strange. It's too much running for me in in college football. I like I like the pros. Is it? They do you know. It's more high tech. More you know players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when it's a job and not just you know. Yeah. Yeah. That could be. <SEP> When you're getting paid millions to do it you ac- I think they take it to another level. Yeah. But I can see it's more you know grunted out run the ball type. College football is a little bit different. But. Yeah. You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then. <SEP> Who- who's that? Notre Dame? No. I root for Nebraska quite a bit. <SEP> N- Nebraska. Yeah. There's a running team. Ye-. Yeah. That that that's boring for me. I I'll take the passing teams any day. Yeah. <SEP> But. Well I can see I can see definitely how you get into that. I to be honest with you I find th- that too much running gets pretty boring as well. And. Yeah. It's just it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle. Right. <SEP> That's you know it gets kind of monotonous. After awhile I I prefer forty a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit. Sure. And but. Well I think they're starting to realize that. A lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore. <SEP> Yeah. It's high dollar. You know it's all it's all money now. Even college is all can we get on T V. Right. So. Yeah. <SEP> That's that's. So uh what's d-. This World League is coming in? Uh that's getting ready to start up right? Right. Yeah. Have you followed that very much. Or. <SEP> Uh not really. I I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L. I think it's basically you know it's it's an institution. Yeah. It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball. It's just I just you know. Yeah. <SEP> I mean it it it can be it can take over part of it. But it's never going to be the next. Right. It can take over a small market share. But nothing really. Yeah. It's going to take a little bit. Some people are going to watch it. But it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything you know. Right. <SEP> It's just it's never going to reach that that standard. But. Yeah. I think I agree with you. It's it's kind of interesting to see uh to see their claim of you know like world football. But when in reality it's really Americans playing somewhere else you know. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of it's kind of strange. Uh I guess we're the only ones who take it that far. <SEP> Everybody else still nuts over soccer. But. Yeah. Actually uh I kind of like soccer. I've never really played it. Yeah? But uh I like the idea. It's it's an interesting game to watch. That and rugby. I've like to watch rugby every now and then. <SEP> Yeah. Or Australian rules football. That's. Yeah. Whatever you want to call it there. <SEP> Yeah. That's some brutal stuff there. That's that's worse than football as far as violence I think. Golly. Those guys kill each other out there. Rugby is something else. Yeah. Yeah. There's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere. Yeah. That's just wild. That's why it's a go- a big college thing. Yeah. <SEP> Rugby is definitely big in college. Because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Tha-. So yeah. I could see the feel for that. But it's it's pretty it's fun to play. Yeah. <SEP> I'll give it that. It is fun to play. If you don't value your very much. You've played it then? But you know I don't think rugby will ever be professional. But it it's it's. No I doubt it you know. Not at least not in this country anyway. <SEP> No. You can't stay healthy and do that. That's a rough game. Yeah. It is. <SEP> But uh I don't know. I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this year. So you. The the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team. They really are. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. My my it's kind of odd. My roommate that I live with here he's uh he's lived in Pennock Minnesota. Do you know where that is? Uh no. I don't. To tell you the truth I'm. It it's a small town. It's about two hours. It's in like central Minnesota. It's a couple of hours uh west of Minneapolis. Okay. <SEP> But uh. To tell you the truth I'm not even really from here. You just live there now. Yeah. I'm I'm up here for a year on an internship. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well he's. But I I actually live in Florida. Live in Florida. Yeah. <SEP> Like the Seahawks. Well you know I. I mean who who who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay right? Hey I I I've only been to Philadelphia twice. <SEP> And I you know I I still like. Really. Really. I mean I guess I could go for Miami. But I don't know. <SEP> Yeah. But. I'm from. I root for Nebraska. So I'm I don't have a real love for Miami anyway. But I don't know. I I guess I get into pretty much.
sw4826.txt:Okay. I'm here. How do you feel about public schools? Well our public schools are are really poor I feel. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation. But uh we're toward the bottom. Yeah. And uh there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But the system doesn't allow for the corrections. Uh-huh. <SEP> How about you? Well that's interesting. I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw Georgia. Oh yes. And uh she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there. And she complained quite a bit about their school system there. <SEP> Yes. And. And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in. Right. <SEP> She was in Cobb County. Right. I'm. I can't really say much about the schools up here. I really don't come from here. Uh-huh. I'm only up here temporarily on an internship. But uh I live in Orlando Florida usually. <SEP> Okay. And the schools down there from what I know are not bad. They're pretty good. Well that's great. But I know that in some I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good. <SEP> Uh-huh. For example I have a brother in North Carolina. And he says the schools there are are incredibly bad. Uh just terrible. Well I feel that we're way behind. Uh I have a son that is in the fourth grade. Huh. <SEP> And uh they have just now taken up division. Wow. Yeah. And. That is slow. <SEP> Uh i-. E-. My husband and I go to the store. And we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things. And I feel like uh there are several areas that we're just really really slow in. Uh-huh. And uh I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system. It is. What do you think's wrong to cause that? <SEP> Well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system. And the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely. Yeah. Uh she my son's teacher has twenty-seven students. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis. Uh. Yeah. Perhaps. <SEP> But more than that I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children. Yeah. And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps ca- the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It it you know it can it can really be bad. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That's that's one thing I worry about. Uh also I think we have a lot of uh Hispanics. There you go. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we have a lot of uh. The county I am I'm in the minorities are mostly Hispanic. Yeah. Probably quite a few black people up there. And and. No. We're from a county we're from the county they marched in. We're in Forsyth county. Oh is that right? <SEP> Yes. And we. And there's very very few blacks. Oh okay. Uh so so that's uh. I I hate to say uh. It's not a problem uh because I hate to feel like they are a problem although they are. Yeah. But you know it it's. You don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever. But then again. <SEP> But it is a problem. Uh especially in the inner schools inner city. Yeah. There is no denying that that. Sure you know. Teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school. <SEP> Well. And you can't put all the children in special education. That's right. You can't do that. Uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know. Right. <SEP> See I grew up in Nebraska. Uh-huh. And the school that I went to there was fantastic. It. I I really consider myself very very lucky. Uh we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty-seven thirty kids to sc- to a class. <SEP> Yeah. But. But your teacher had control. Yeah. We zipped right along you know. I I was I was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I I believe I was too. Uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But you're right you know. With all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline I think. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school. Yeah. We just can not afford it. Right. I was going to ask you if there if that was an option. <SEP> Uh if.
sw4382.txt:. Well here in Logan Utah we've got a nice little valley here. And it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in. And then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley. Huh. Well here in Seattle uh it's g- the air's getting more and more polluted. We're uh we're in kind of a basin. And uh Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains. And uh there's been a lot a lot of growth population growth around here. And uh it's uh it's getting worse. I think most of it is from cars. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo. And Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north. We get a lot of pollution. And it's like seventy percent of it is from cars. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion. And when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above. And it just sits and sits and sits. And we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago. Oh. <SEP> It's not it's almost sad. Because when I grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys. And now it's not in the mountain valleys. Yeah. Yeah. I live in the university district. And uh uh it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution. I think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school. <SEP> Huh. And then we're right next to Interstate Five also. They're getting serious about things like uh mandatory. Well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties. Emissions. Oh yeah. Have they started doing that yet? <SEP> Yeah. They've actually started doing it down along the. Not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better. We have a lot population is a lot lighter up here. We have that here. And uh they're they're expanding it to uh more counties here. Uh as the population spreads out. And I think they're also going to be making it uh mandatory for more cars. Th- th- there was uh something in the law about if your car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore. And I think they're eliminating that uh that loophole. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. They're ge- eliminating that out here. Yeah. They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun. Where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust. Kind of like a radar gun. And. Oh really. You mean they could do that remotely? <SEP> Yes. Yeah. Do it remotely just looking at the what they do. They do several different types of things. Sometimes they put a source light. And they look at the source light. And then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it. And you can look at the emissions actually. Huh. <SEP> And. Now where does the source light go? Like across the street. They'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense. Oh I see. <SEP> And they're also looking at uh other you know ways of monitoring this and cause they've found out something basically that uh. And a poorly tuned car can emit something. It's an incredible amount. It was like four hundred times as much uh of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a properly tuned car. Jeez. And and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know you it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half. Yeah. That's neat. <SEP> But it's also been uh oh you know. Everybody is talking about using more mass transient here. But it uh it's tough you know. Like I've I've looked into riding the bus to work. And I can drive to work in uh and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges. Uh-huh. But if I uh if I take the bus it requires several transfers. And it takes over an hour. <SEP> Huh. So so it it's it's not hard to see why why I keep driving. Yeah. And they're. And you know I feel guilty cause I'm driving a.
sw4353.txt:Okay. Thanks. Huh. Do you all have a budget? Well uh yeah. We we do. Um we've been married for twenty-three years. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we have uh three teenage daughters. And you know they're very expensive. So uh uh we yeah we have somewhat of uh a system. Uh it's it's kind of uh you know it's kind of hard to explain. Yeah. We've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts. We always had just one. <SEP> Uh-huh. And now we are having two. Uh it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal. Yeah. It's uh. So I have to be. That's that's kind of the way I feel about it. <SEP> Yeah. I usually uh. My wife handles a lot of the day to day finances. And of course we're ju- like ther- like a lot of people. We just scramble through month to month you know. Yes. And uh. Do you have a two income family or one income? <SEP> Uh we have a two income uh family. Yeah. She also works. Yeah. <SEP> And uh but she she enjoys it. And she's good at it. Uh if it's if it's. I am kind of uh uh I'm pretty bad about procrastinating. Uh-huh. And one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> You know how that goes. But uh uh if she she handles it pretty well. She uh she writes all the checks you know once a month. So your wife. Yes. It. That. What. Her is her career uh related to to finance or accounting? <SEP> Uh sort of on a peripheral. She's uh uh an annuity administrator. Oh. And so she uh she works for an insurance company. Uh-huh. <SEP> But but she enjoys it. She likes keeping track of all that stuff. And uh. Yeah. So that's sort of related to her field a little bit. Yeah. Sort of. Yeah. <SEP> And we you know we've experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh. But if you know. You have to keep up with them. So a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear. We try to keep our uh our retirement and our savings kind of automated. Yeah. So we never see that money. Just like taken directly. It's just taking it out right. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. We do the same thing. And that that's kind of handy. Yeah. Because if you don't see it you don't miss it. Yeah. If. <SEP> You don't spend it. You have something to take it out. That's exactly what we've always done. Yeah. And we've had uh they've always had uh where they match your funds you know. Sometimes if you if you save so much then they will match it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh that you know we've done that too. But my husband works for an insurance company. Uh-huh. And he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years I guess. But he was with another company before that. But we have we have. I I work also. But I only have a part time job. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I get paid very little. But uh you know I try to use that money for food mo-. Jim gives me a certain amount money. You know we just transfer it into my account. Yeah. Uh-huh. And then I use that for food household expenses. And then I add my own check to that. And then with that I try and handle you know some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that. <SEP> Yeah. But the expenses that we need and have around the house. Yeah. It sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do. So. <SEP> Just kind of play it by ear but keep the the deductions you know. Yeah. Yeah. We. <SEP> Well Jim has Jim has a budget. I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down. Uh-huh. Uh you know. I am given so much mon- money a month. So I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I try not to you know. We don't you know I don't ask for more. I mean I just try and make it on that. Uh-huh. Yeah. Because I think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. And uh you can you can really waste a lot of money that way. <SEP> Yeah. So uh well how long have you been married? Uh about five years. Yeah. Oh yeah. So you're just really getting started. <SEP> So do you have a family too? Uh I've got one little girl. She's like uh nineteen months. Oh yeah. Yeah. <SEP> So uh she's she's not uh. She hasn't effected your budget yet really. Not not really. Not too bad. Uh. No. Not like she will later on. <SEP> Yeah. You will see that all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do. Yeah. When. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know. Yeah. What can we do here. And then you have to really sit down and plan some more. And uh but I think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget. <SEP> Yeah. And then as the girls got older I think we we did more and more of that. You know more budgeting as as they got older. Uh-huh. Uh but uh but what do you do? Do you. <SEP> I'm uh I I work for I'm an electronic technician. Oh okay. I work at a for a university. Uh Georgia Tech uh research. Oh. Well good. <SEP> And uh. Good. So I just uh. Well we just have you know we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta. I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things. I'd better get back to the subject. <SEP> Oh well. But uh budgeting. I found you know I feel a lot better. You know we use to work out of one check book. Uh-huh. And it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month. <SEP> Yeah. Now I have know exactly what I'm spending. And it's so much easier.
sw4378.txt:One way or another we're now recording. Okay. Um um oh yeah. Home repair. <SEP> You were helping your parents. Right. I still am really. They're uh sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta in Candler Park. Uh-huh. And uh we've done lots to it. We've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them. And. <SEP> So you're remodeling? Uh-huh. Okay. How about you? <SEP> Well I I just live in a I live in an apartment now. I uh two summers ago I went to Massachusetts. Uh-huh. And I went with a friend of mine. And we undertook a building house. Uh-huh. <SEP> And this was a a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions. And it's preconstructed you might say. Uh-huh. And we started in uh we started from an empty lot with uh trees and stuff on it. <SEP> And we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot. We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. Pour the basement and uh went from the ground up. Wow. Our one of our main problems was. Wow. <SEP> Well in Massachusetts I thought I was going to. Well it was a a fun time. But I thought gosh summer time you know. Uh-huh. Well all it ever did was rain and thunder storms. <SEP> And one thing is that we're we had we were going to pour the basement foundation. Uh-huh. And we're in the process. And it started pouring down rain. Huh. <SEP> And I guess we had most of it done. But the end was result. What happened was that some of the the wa- a lot of water settled on the top. And it really didn't give a very good finish. And some of the. It was sort of sandy and and not uh a very good finish. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> But it turned it was okay. And it's only the basement floor. So it was okay. Yeah. But uh it kept us pretty busy. It was only uh. There was well me and my friend. And then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a a family type. Uh-huh. <SEP> It wasn't you know like a commercial project or something. It was sort of just you know uh gets your get his you know my bro- my brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes. Uh-huh. Wow. <SEP> And and then materials coming in. Uh-huh. And so we're we're hopping around pretty good. But overall yeah we got it done. And it's a three bedroom two bath house. And it's pretty neat. Nice. <SEP> Yeah. So. Nice. So uh I mean what was it for? You just. Well it was uh for my friend's parents. They had some property there. And they'd lived in this this old. <SEP> It's sort of like a farm you might say. And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something. Uh-huh. And his mom just wanted a a new house. You know. Uh-huh. <SEP> That has been her dream. And so we did that. And uh she was really pleased with it. So it came really great. That's great. So. Wow. <SEP> So what why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot. Huh? Where you live it gets very hot? Yeah. It does. <SEP> And that's why you. An- and the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in? Huh. Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in uh you know the solar game? Right. <SEP> Have you. What what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or. No. We just we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass. My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it. Oh okay. Okay. And uh but it. See in a lot of the windows? <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh it's the house is eighty years old. And it's had several owners and stuff. And uh they have put plastic Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows. Okay. <SEP> Oh these. So you have the sash windows in? Uh-huh. Did t- uh did it go up and down? Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh I see. Yeah. And so uh and and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there. Uh-huh. So. <SEP> Yes. There's a problem with those. Those are uh. They usually most of the time don't open very well. Yeah. Ours didn't. Uh-huh. And the ones that would open uh wouldn't want to stay open. They wanted to slam shut. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And they also there they they. A lot of vibration. And it causes the glass to crack. And it's a never ending problem. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. So. So I haven't uh I haven't been in any really home repair things lately. I.
sw4725.txt:Regarding uh taxes. I you know. Taxes are really a necessary evil and in a civilized society. But really people get upset at taxes because you it's more efficient to do things yourself. Right. And uh and so as as a result uh you know it's it's a trade-off you know for the common good you know. For for the benefit of others you know. How much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others? Have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really don't deserve it? <SEP> Uh well yeah. I know it's it's a lot you know that uh that I feel like you know just like you said that there's just so much that you can do yourself. That you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for. But they're giving it to other people that don't really need it ei- either. But yet they accept it. Well the thing of it is if I wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader I guess I could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know lo- lo- look for uh look for people to uh take care of me. <SEP> Like so many people do. Uh-huh. And uh probably a good woman. Right? <SEP> Right. Just you know just just con somebody to take care of me. And then you don't have to be on the tax roll. Right. But uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing. And everybody really hates it. It was very timely. I I I always over pay my my deductions. So I wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding. <SEP> Uh-huh. So uh you know that that's always a smile. But of course you know I've I've paid it in. And I should calculate it better. <SEP> Right. You are you in business for yourself? No. I I I work for the F B I. <SEP> So I I'm a federal employee. Right. Yeah. Guess I don't sound like it huh? <SEP> Uh well I th-. No. I think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as as everybody else you know. Unless you work for Internal Revenue. Yeah. I belong. Oh I I've got all four feet in the trough you know being a federal employee. <SEP> Yeah. And and so but but I can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits. Like every every time there is a a bond issue you know I vote no on every one of them. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. I'm I. But there. This is this is tax not tax revolt country. I mean there's too many. Every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know. Plus our snout right up to our ears. Yeah. So you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that that you want to you know get into a tax revolt situation. <SEP> Right. But uh uh the uh the local taxes here I I. I- in this particular area uh you know I've uh I think I pay about uh oh thirty-five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know. And which is a lot of money. Right. An- and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and they they're building old people's homes uh you know at tax expense. Well I think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper. At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes. Why I I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that. Right? Yeah. That's right. You know. In in instead it's it's the taxes here. So. <SEP> Yeah. Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not you know or Seguin or someplace like that. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. But uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer. And and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer. If you're not going to use them then you want to be in in environment. That's a strategy I think tha- that the people have to have to take. Is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living. You know. I'm I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire. And and I'm saying well you know I really can't stay here uh as a retiree. After you retire. Yeah. It's too expensive. <SEP> Yeah. I'm going to have go out and you know in you know East Fork someplace. And and do my thing you know. Right. <SEP> My parents are in the same situation you know. They their home is paid for. But still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes. And they have no children in school or you know anything now. They don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards. Right. They they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five you know. Uh yeah. And they're not doing it a- again you know. <SEP> Yeah. So. Well it's certainly uh uh. You must be a T I employee. You must be what? You must be a T I employee? <SEP> No. I'm not. You're not a T I. Who do you work for? I I don't work. I'm a student. I go to school. I'm in nursing school. You you're.
sw4697.txt:Well th- the question was talking about the juries. And uh one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that uh. Maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again. Uh so that uh a judge I think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. Right. I I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases uh the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed. <SEP> Right. <SEP> Uh I I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case. Right. So a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there. Uh-huh. <SEP> And if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri- position to give an appropriate uh sentencing. Yeah. See I agree with you. Uh one thing I heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court. I mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything. Uh you go. And you present your case. The other side presents their case. And you're done with it. It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. Uh-huh. Uh and uh but it's not that we have uh such. It didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending. Uh so I. That was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. <SEP> In other words not not. There would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? Yes. Yes. Now. <SEP> I I I don't. Th- there's a point on which we don't agree. Uh-huh. I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a one of the parties wants one. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I usually it is the defendant I guess that wants to have the jury hear the case. Sure. So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know. <SEP> That would require a change in the Bill of Rights I believe. And so. Oh yes. And and I wasn't I didn't mean that. Oh oh okay. I I didn't mean that no. Because I mean gee whiz if I was uh uh didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that oh. Yes I would feel uh you're right that my civil rights had been violated. But I meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here. We're not going to have a jury you know. Let's get it over with. Sort of like car accidents you know. <SEP> Right. Well I think that's all ready possible. Yeah. I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Right. <SEP> So. I agree that that should be encouraged. Uh-huh. People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial. But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into per- giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher uh you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award. Right. Giving a different sentence. <SEP> Uh-huh. The take. Right. <SEP> Yeah. And I suspect it in cases like. I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil. Is that right? Well I I i- we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well uh in the case of civil uh things I think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage. <SEP> And I think that may be where jury use is overdone. I mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently. <SEP> Right. Right. <SEP> But the lawyers are really uh. It's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible. Uh-huh. <SEP> So. Uh I was wondering too if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in in a criminal cases. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that. But I am in favor of it for criminal cases. So there's a difference of my view there for those two. Right. Right. Yeah. Bu- well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that. Have you ever had to serve jury duty? N-. Well I was called once when I was nineteen. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me. And I was doing school and things like. They they let me out. Uh-huh. An- I've never had to it since. And that was almost twenty years ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. It isn't. Sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in uh. That would have been about uh twenty years too. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh uh just last year. And uh the case I heard was a criminal case. And it seemed it really trivial. It involved two bicycles. Uh-huh. <SEP> We didn't do the sentencing. The judge did. Huh. So. How interesting. <SEP> We we a- rendered a verdict. And then the judge was the one to do the sentencing. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And that was here in Wisconsin. So I I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it.
sw4334.txt:Type of music is hot down in Texas? Uh well I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas. I know what's hot down here with me. So that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know. I don't ever listen to the radio. And that's usually what's hot around here. So So what kind of music do you like? Oh okay. <SEP> Uh mostly folk music. Folk music. Yeah. I find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or New England uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well we're on totally different wavelengths. Okay. I'm more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know uh Van Halen that kind of thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. What about uh classic rock type stations. Uh I don't listen to the radio at all. We live in a fairly small town. So uh classic rock for me is what I have which is like uh Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix. Oh okay. <SEP> So some some of the older Eagles stuff was good. Uh. <SEP> Yeah. I I didn't like uh. They started getting a little more you know. The type of music at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes. And I don't like listening at high volumes. Yeah. Yeah. But uh some of their older s- stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me. <SEP> Yeah. Well they. You know Ho- Hotel California and that era. Yeah. Yeah. That does that's something you don't doesn't even sound good loud really. You know. Yeah. <SEP> You know definitely. Uh so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some I might know of. I don't know any folk music at all. Well down in Texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then. Yeah. Oh yeah. Here. I'm sure there's a lot of that down there. <SEP> Oh plenty. Way way more than I can stand down here. I I don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it. I. Well there there's a Conway Twitty twang. Then there's the uh Dolly Parton uh Hollywood sound. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's more even more commercialized for of country music. Yeah. But uh it's getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as I see it. Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses. So. Yeah. I think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts. <SEP> Yeah. It's it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is. Concert tours for country and western sings is it's it's quite quite odd. But uh I don't know. It's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays I think. It's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know. Hey. I I I think most artists are in to make a few bucks. Yeah. And that's all it. But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do-. <SEP> Yeah. Late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message. That's what it. <SEP> Yeah. That's what what you say. And and then music is wrapped around now. Now it's the other way around. Yeah. I I don't I don't think Gun. At least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message too much to say. No. No. They don't have anything really important you want to hear. But you know it's kind of odd. It's like it doesn't have to be good. It's just who does it you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> You hear a you hear a Paula Abdul song. And you. And I think if somebody else were to play that you know they wouldn't they nobody everybody would think that's lousy. But because she did it it's supposed to be good you know. It comes to the point where it's your name not what you do more than anything. Right. Madonna can do anything. And it would be considered good because it's Madonna you know. Right. <SEP> Madonna could start playing folk music. And folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it. So it's it's it's really backwards how things are working now. Uh-huh. But. Yeah. I- i- it's the artist not the merit. <SEP> Yeah. Exactly. So I don't know I I don't know that that's I don't think that's a good thing at all. But that's that's what the point we've reached. So I don't know how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least. Yeah. Well I don't know. I know for myself that uh for the most part I don't know which artist is which. So I listen to a song. I either like the song. Or I don't like it. <SEP> Yeah. And then if I really like the song eventually I'll figure out who it was. Yeah. Yeah. That's about how I am on popular music. I don't you know you don't I don't know enough about it because I just listen. Uh everything I listen to is what I buy not whatever they play on the radio. So. Well you have to figure out what to buy. Or do you just buy along the same artist? <SEP> Uh I. Yeah. I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time. I don't really switch around to new things very often. Yeah. It's just it's you know it's way to hectic and too confusing. Yeah. So you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop? <SEP> Uh. Yeah. Generally. Or about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard. Yeah. And I listen to it that way. But as far as. Yeah. I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it. Yeah. See that's one thing I like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know. There's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey. <SEP> Yeah. And it's very nice. You go into the coffee house. And you know an artist is there. And very often the artist will have a d- an album. And so if you like the artist you buy the album. Yeah. So you definitely get to try before you buy. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's definitely. I. You know it. You you you don't always quite get it right.
sw4868.txt:Budgeting activity in our household I has is uh uh kind of an informal kind of situation. We we you know put. Actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited. I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore. It just gets deposited. And and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in. And you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. You see. And so our our budgeting. W- we really don't have a formal budgeting situation. Every time I've ever tried one it's uh I've just got wrapped in my inertia. And uh I've just decided not to pursue it. Uh what what's your budget situation? <SEP> Well actually uh I've I've had a couple of different situations. My current one has been the most successful. Uh at a certain point in life. An- my husband my ex-husband was an alcoholic. And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies. And that left me with three teenagers. You know well a- a- actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it? It certainly is. <SEP> But at any rate what happened was that I I just absolutely put away all the credit cards. I didn't rip them up. I didn't send them back. Nothing. I just put them away. Because there was one that it was really handy to have. If I absolutely had to have something I could go use it. Uh-huh. But uh mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had. And if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it. But then as things improved you know. Once once I got them all through college uh it came to the point where uh. My parents came through the depression. I'm not sure how old you are. Well my you know my my parents too. You you you were born in in the in the late thirties or early forties. <SEP> But my. Late thirties. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> And uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house. And that's kind of the way I was raised. And so I'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect. So for quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money. Um. Now meanwhile I got had a a building bank balance. And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there. And not ever have to spend any money on interest. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well that that's good. And that that's the way I've operated ever since then. It. And you know if if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it. Well we we buy what well. We just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher. <SEP> Oh my. And and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars. Oh my !. And you know. <SEP> Oh my. Right. I mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in. But but we also have zero in- interest being paid. And we pay it off as as it goes. Uh-huh. And that's the way I do my credit cards now. Yeah. So we never really get that much over uh over extended. <SEP> Yeah. I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards. Huh. But it's the fact that I have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full. Yeah. We're we're doing that. We have you know uh. Th- this is our our our big uh. We did redecorating. Two you know two new pieces in the ref- in the family room and new carpet. I mean we just uh we've just been spending spending spending. <SEP> Oh my. I'm envious. Well I. Bu- but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year. <SEP> Uh-huh. So we're you know we don't have that. It's time for you to do these things then. Right? Yeah. It's uh it's about time that we did that. But th- the the terrible part about it. I've looked at it all. And it all looks still pretty good to me. Why why we need to replace it? <SEP> But but un- unfortunately my my my wife really feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate uh thing to to I mean. That rug is thirteen years old. Why not replace it. I mean uh I say it might go for another thirteen. But uh too late we'll never find that out. This is so funny. That's wonderful. But you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it. And. <SEP> I mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not. You know I I I don't spend that much money. I just uh we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know. We sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they they got through school. And that was the major you know decade of expenses you know. So we we feel as uh. But as far as any formal budgeting uh you know I I we just apparently have been very fortunate. When we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat. We never really you know have to program money for that or make choices you know. But uh we don't have that uproarious a a lifestyle. After all we're.
sw4736.txt:Capital punishment uh I guess out in California is has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper. Uh apparently you know there's they haven't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe. Uh yeah. That's that's as far back as I can remember. Well that's before my time actually. Yeah. They. <SEP> Well I we were we uh we just started we lived in Redwood City when we were out there. Uh-huh. And uh and we found that uh you know it was a very liberal kind of community. But the uh I I really feel that that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars. And then they they uh uh you know lawyers these lawyer groups get together. And they uh they I think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process. Uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years. Uh and I I think that uh that there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that. I think capital punishment uh uh was or probably stringent enough. But I think the appeal process is really getting in the way. <SEP> Uh-huh. Do do you feel as though there should be uh more uh was or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment? Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not. It's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself. It's at that point where they're saying like here you're you're going on death row. But you'll stay there for twenty years. Uh-huh. <SEP> And nothing is being done about it. Uh the laws exist and are frequently upheld in in uh in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find. And it's it's really getting out of hand in many states. Well the term technicality. The law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous acts are done to uh to you know to get somebody into a a situation where they're going to be guilty of of a crime. <SEP> Or whether uh an- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impuned. Uh but or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a uh a you know a non a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it. But but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker as being supportive. Now I I'm a- a- at this juncture. I you know I'm I'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality. You know that that's what all c- these these hearings are about. And that's what all these you know court cases are about. I mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of out of the can. And uh you know he he tried to appeal his conviction. Uh. And you know it didn't work. But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry. Uh in in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of Hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody. And he you were his slave. And if he didn't like what you did he killed you. <SEP> And that has that's pretty effective. Uh you know it's not good for civil rights I guess. But it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community. And if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods. So I I I mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh imaginations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in so- in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing. Well it seems like well it it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished. And the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off. Um for instance um there's a case a few years back where uh someone uh someone who's being convicted for was under a tri- was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that. The of- the arresting officer uh did not read the defendant their rights. Uh-huh. <SEP> And where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet.
sw4572.txt:So uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy? Ooh well I don't know. What do you think? Oh I don't know. I had a little bit more time to think about it. I was thinking of like uh. I don't know. I was ju- started to think about all the big you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those you know demographics studies that they do that um you know have who knows how much you know stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I don't know. I don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there. But I know they use that I mean they sell those. Huh. <SEP> Well what about uh required drug testing uh as a uh condition of employment? Yeah. That was that that was the other one I was thinking of. I think that's uh. I mean I know drugs are illegal. It thing actually. Uh I uh have worked at Texas Instruments. Huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh they instituted a drug policy there. Drug testing policy where they randomly would test uh employees. Uh-huh. And actually to tell you the truth I really did not think much about it. I I hadn't you know. It really didn't relate to me. But there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have. Uh-huh. <SEP> And also uh uh this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing this kind of big brother activity. And yet uh a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they don't admit to it it's actually oh a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure. Uh-huh. So what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this. Although they don't actually e- execute it themselves it's really the government that. So in that sense it at least philosophically it's really borderline legal. Uh-huh. Well I I think the I think that you know a person's competence should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior. And if they're you know if they're on some kind of you know contol- controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate them. I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a you know a chemical you know. <SEP> Well what about this uh AIDS epidemic now? Where you find that uh uh you know certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for it- others. These people that are carriers and don't that don't reveal it? Yeah. And and uh of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't. <SEP> It uh it destroys their libido. Yeah tha- that would be kind of an extreme. <SEP> Now uh you know if they ever. I mean I've heard of things like you know making them you know marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all someplace like in a kind of. So what about that as an invasion of privacy? Yeah. Wel- I guess it kind of borders on where I mean what do you value more. The invasion of uh the person's privacy or the possible danger to you know other people. <SEP> So really. It i- gets to balancing uh personal freedom against uh the general welfare of society. Yeah. I guess that's alwa- that's been the big role of government I guess. I mean generally. <SEP> Well it it's supposed to have been. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's kind of a difficult one to go into. I mean that that particular case. No. It. Because I mean there's a lot of people that uh I mean they could require you know ob- obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I'm you know there's a huge part of the population. Not a huge part but a you know. <SEP> A growing part. The AIDS population I guess that have it that don't know they do are spreading it. Uh-huh. But again to require you know such a test and jus- and then to make make it is to subject them to to discrimi- discriminatory practices and other things. I don't know. Uh I don't know how exactly I feel about that. <SEP> Maybe chop their weenies off.
sw4376.txt:Your turn. Okay. Uh I don't think they should abolish it. I think I think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got. But not for petty theft? <SEP> Right. No. No. For major things like premeditated murder. Mass murders. Uh you know that type of thing. I don't think it should just be used loosely. Well it should be used as a deterrent do you think? Well. Or should it be used uh. A- to prevent further uh crime? Huh. <SEP> Yes. Yes. To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street. By you know some technicality. And they go down the line ten years. And then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you know that's about the only thing. Like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know. I don't think they should do that. Well you know there's this old uh Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Oh well I guess if I if it was someone in my family I'd probably feel that way. <SEP> You know I've never had anybody in my immediate family uh murdered. And so I really wouldn't know. But but I feel like if I did I probably would feel that way. Well one of the things I was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value. So if you have someone that that destroys that value uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss. Uh-huh. Of course you have to also put value on the criminal. <SEP> Right. So if you terminate him that's a loss of value. Well that's true. So you know if you weight everyone equally then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him. If you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person. In other words you'd have to you'd have to murder more than one other person uh in order to justify taking his life. <SEP> Besides him. Okay. Another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people. Uh which is pretty delicate thing to do. But one way of doing it is uh by income. So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then then he's obviously not worth very much. <SEP> His life isn't worth very much then. And so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is uh integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of who knows eight hundred thousand dollars. Uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is uh small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him. Of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less. Which means well. <SEP> Right. I suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation. Potential. I mean that's that's the key right there. Potential. Uh-huh. <SEP> Now are they are they rehabilitative or or not. Now that's all fine and well and and uh good philosophical. But if you're involved yourself personally. Uh-huh. Uh I know I have a friend whose uh son was murdered uh on the night before his sixteenth birthday. And let me tell you uh I I knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well. And uh you're talking about real trauma. I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies. <SEP> I can imagine. The father you know. Of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get I think in terms of psychological impact. Yes. Uh and. <SEP> Was he murdered? Did they find who killed him? Oh yes. They found him. And he is on trial for capital murder. So it hasn't been a long time ago. Just recently. Uh well actually he has I I'm sorry. He was convicted uh. And of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process. But. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That appeals process I mean it's what you know really you know just drags out and out and out. My brother-in-law here in Texas his by marriage my sister's uh husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy in in well actually in Houston. And uh he.
sw4336.txt:Uh well I'm not sure how it is in Georgia. But in in Pittsburgh the r- the crime rate really is not very high at the moment. Is that is that true for for Atlanta? Atlanta is kind of high. Uh it's it's lower than it has been in the past. Uh I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off. And usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher. Yeah. I. That's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere. <SEP> Yeah. Uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into? Any specifics? Well uh the least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences. What's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store or a car theft you know it things of that nature. Very few uh assaults. Although on the college campuses uh there are uh cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners. Um. But mostly petty things and n- no nothing nothing really too big. <SEP> Right. Well I guess here we run into that sometime. But I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins. Right. There are some but not not very high. Uh as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either. There were one case where uh this one guy uh was taking women from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all. Uh-huh. <SEP> So so that's kind of like a double assault there. Yeah. Uh a strange case that uh that happened oh it's about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine. Really? It was a free standing machine. And they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh wow. Now there's a crime for you. <SEP> Yeah. There's a crime. Yeah. But uh I guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous. Although uh from what I hear in the news. And and I I s- saw an episode of the T V show COPS uh one time that was in Pittsburgh. Uh-huh. And uh it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that. But I I don't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common. <SEP> Oh okay. I don't know. Crime situations here they. Like I say lot of lot of cases is usually just apartments and and break ins and things like that. And a lot of it is due to drugs. Uh drug related you know in in most cases. Yeah. It's not like uh it's someone do steal a a or television or V C R or something like that. It is for drugs you know because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you know. You going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it. Yeah. <SEP> So you really not making a sizeable profit. So it's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist. You know I just to diverge a little bit uh I live in an apartment. Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh. And uh the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in. Right. But even so it I mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out you know and things like that. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. There's a T V and a V C R. And they could uh they could get in pretty easy and and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music. Uh-huh. It could still happen then. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. But you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not uh participating in any type crime. I guess there was one case. I was surprised uh. So happened this person worked at the same place. I work for Georgia Tech. And they work at the same place I did. But I didn't know that they had been watching me. Because I was getting ready to to go in my car one morning. And the first thing they said is uh you must don't have to be to work at eight you know. Like shock.
sw4877.txt:Okay. Uh so your you I guess you're probably in the same uh same situation uh we're in. We're kind of past having to provide child care. Our our kids are grown up. We don't have any grandchildren yet. But uh uh they're. Uh-huh. How old are your children? <SEP> Uh one's twenty-six. And the other is uh twenty twenty-one. Uh-huh. So they're uh uh They're they're getting there. Well they're going to be getting there. <SEP> You know there's no no no prospects right away for anything to happen. Yeah. U- uh-huh. Oh I see. <SEP> But uh. I have uh five children. I have a eighteen year old son. The rest of my girls are like twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine. Uh-huh. And I have three granddaughters right now. <SEP> Oh. And uh I uh. One's in Iowa. Uh-huh. And uh she's she's a teacher. And what she does is she teaches at a preschool. <SEP> Oh okay. And and so she kind of. And they let her bring her her little daughter in for free. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then so. But she just works part-time. Uh-huh. Then I have another daughter in uh Bountiful Utah. And she has to work full-time. And it's just tearing her apart. She has a private baby-sitter. <SEP> Yeah. And uh the baby just screams. I mean the baby is like seventeen months. And she just screams. Uh-huh. Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there. They're not even there yet you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. It's hard. We. And and then I have my uh uh I have a seven month old granddaughter. And uh her mother stays home. And she they live they live with us. You know in as Orange County is really expensive. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. They live with us. And so of course we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time. But uh uh she just. Uh she used to work in pre in the preschool and and and child care. And she says after working in there. And and you know here she was a provider. But you know there's only so much one person can do. <SEP> Yeah. She said it's so awful. She said she'll never put her child in a in a in a preca- in a p- in a preschool. Uh-huh. I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere. <SEP> Huh. But it's really it's really really very difficult. And. Yeah. What did you do when your kids were growing up? Were you. Well when when. The uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years I stayed home. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh then after that I I went to work. Uh-huh. And uh uh uh a couple of times I just uh uh you know. Th- then I had one job. And then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job. And then and then like about later I I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter. Supposed to be good uh recommended person from the church. And I knew her personally. She had two kids of her own and everything. But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean first of all uh her children were sick all the time. So when my son stayed over there he got sick. He got sick. Yeah. Same thing same thing that the her kids had. Right? <SEP> Right. Well. And so uh we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock. Then he she'd take my son and her daughter over t- to kindergarten. But s-. That day uh I was saying now he he's sick. And she goes well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have. That's what he got you know. Goes well okay. So it's not like he's going to infect her kids. But then what happened was is I said uh he just threw up. And kindergarten starts at eleven thirty. So she said well she'll keep him home. And he'll probably just sleep anyway. Well you know what. That woman sent her sent him to kindergarten. She sent him to kindergarten. As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him. And he threw up again. And they put him in the nursery uh they put him in the nurse's office. <SEP> Guess so. Yeah. And then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter. Called her. And they said uh that he's sick. Well she wasn't home. Huh. I mean her all her kids were sick. But she wasn't home right. And her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick. Now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her? No. She didn't do that. So it got to the point where he's he's supposed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty. And I had to leave work. It was it was five o'clock in the evening. And I found out he was still there at school. And they were calling me. And they said somebody's got to pick him up. And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school. I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. And he had a hundred and four fever. They couldn't uh give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything. <SEP> Right. I was so furious. I I quit that job. And I stayed home for awhile longer. Then I went and got a uh a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better. Yeah. A little more flexibility. You can come and go. Yeah. But uh I haven't had any good really very good experience with child care. <SEP> Yeah. When when our kids were small we had a couple of uh good good women who uh would often c- uh get them to come to the house.
sw4346.txt:Okay. Okay. You go first. Well I have uh two kids. I have one seven and one five. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh they're in a public school here in Tyler. And uh I'm happy with it. Uh-huh. I'm happy with the school. It's great. Good teachers. Good curriculum uh. They learn a lot. They have no problems uh. But I do live in the better well in the best part of the city. Though I live in you know the real richy part I guess. I'm not. <SEP> But everybody around me is. And uh but they're. I have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town. And their schools are kind of rundown and uh older. And they don't really offer as much I don't know as uh the school that my girls are in. I don't really think that's fair. You know. Uh-huh. Uh but you know I'm happy with what they're in. So go ahead. <SEP> Well yeah. It it's it's pretty much what I was s- going to say. Is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in. Uh-huh. Uh I grew up in New York. And uh the place. Wow. <SEP> Or not New York City upstate New York. Uh-huh. And I went to uh the City of Rochester School District. Uh-huh. <SEP> And s- a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs. And it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other. But the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial. Uh-huh. And uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system. Right. <SEP> And that would result in some uh could result in more equitable distribution of money. Because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs. And the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with. Uh-huh. As a result the schools were rundown. There wasn't as many you know of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked. There wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when I was a senior that some other schools had. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it it. So I you know I think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people. And the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools. Yeah. Right. <SEP> So you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of. Also uh the the family environment. You know you can come to south Tyler where I live. And you have got room mothers in every room. You've got art mothers. You've got every every holiday. There's parties. All these kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something. Yeah. You can go to north Tyler to the schools. And the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. You know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh that has a a whole lot to do with it you know. As far as their learning I mean if the parents aren't uh you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know they really don't have much of a chance at all. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Why is that? Huh? <SEP> Why is that? Why you asking. You j- they just don't. I mean I mean I'm I'm up there at my kids' school. I know what they're learning. And if they're up I call and find out you know. Is she having problems. Does she need help with anything. No. She's doing fine. Okay you know uh. And I I know kids that their parents could really give a rip. And the kids are not motivated. <SEP> Right. Right. They have no motivation from home. So they just go to school. And you know eh you know I'll get through the day and uh bring homework home. And there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this. <SEP> Right. Uh just you know they they take a notion to do it. They do. And uh that doesn't work either you know. They have to have guidance. And uh they can't just have it at school and then come home. Uh-huh. And there's nothing you know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that that that was a big factor for me. I ended up coming out of of the public school system very well and was very good education uh. Uh-huh. Ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I think the difference for me was that my parents were you know they were definitely they were always there. Yeah. Was like well. Yeah. Of course you're going to study and do well. And that's the way. Of course are you.
sw4364.txt:So do you your privacy being invaded at any time? Well uh one of the things that uh that I found to be uh an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the on the uh credit card bill. That is something that is not required. Well yo-. <SEP> Right. And in fact uh it is actually prohibited. But it doesn't stop many people many people from uh from doing it. And it's n- o- one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic uh research. And to get th- your your phone number on uh uh lists for phone solicitations. Yeah. Yeah. Now th- that y- s- you can still yeah. I've always done that. I started. Once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse. And I say what are you going to do. You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all. And then ultimately they say no. You don't have to put it down. But uh really it's part of this compliance thing. Uh-huh. Uh the thing I don't like. I know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles. <SEP> Uh-huh. That really burns me because hey you're required. You have to do that. Right. And nowhere does it say you h- asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I think that it it's one thing f- to uh voluntarily give it because someone asks. You can always refuse. But it's another thing where it's required by law. And then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. You know. Right. Uh That. I don't think I don't think they have the right to do that. <SEP> I agree with you there. That's something that uh people have seen. Oh here's an easy way to make some money. But uh I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not. I I've heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state. Uh the budget problems up here are are pretty tense. And people are looking for alternate ways of uh. En- enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use. And they were talking about selling the D M V lists. And there was a lot of uh a lot of uh consternation about that. And the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea. But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made uh public that you don't know about. <SEP> Well that's easy. Whenever you donate money to someone? Uh-huh. They you become put on something like a sucker list. And you start getting millions of calls or solicitations. <SEP> Right. And then you s- y- y-. It kind of makes you feel from doing it again. Uh-huh. Like uh National Public Radio or any of these the public uh stations you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. I I I I think I sent in in money for f- once to uh to public uh T V. Uh-huh. And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine. <SEP> Huh. I. It's like. And it just started soon after I had done that one. Right. And I just said this is this is terrible. Uh and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh it's one thing. They don't sell the list. But the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people. Th- the people do these phonathons. Right. And they call you up. And they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that. And and they say oh we we know you. You uh had uh contributed x amount last year. Can you do better this year? And you know like hold on here. <SEP> How do you know that? Who how do you know that? Why why you even telling me this? Is it any of your business? I mean it's one thing that I and the college knows that. That's just our business. There's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all. <SEP> Uh-huh. Just uh. And that was very offensive too. I. And so. Last year the uh Lotus Development Company the uh company that puts out One Two Three was planning on marketing a uh C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right.
sw4330.txt:Well uh does the company you work for test for drugs? Actually uh they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting. Because w- when I went to work for them uh they didn't do that. But uh since then they've they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own uh convictions but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that. Huh. <SEP> How about you? Uh no. We're not being tested for drugs at all uh. Our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or its reasons for immediate dismissal. Uh-huh. It says use of narcotics on company premises. <SEP> Um. So that's pretty general. But uh I work for an environmental management firm. Okay. And I'm an engineer there. But I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites. But I don't operate any machinery. <SEP> Yeah. Now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a a medical monitoring program. Uh-huh. Because they're at a higher risk of exposure. And blood screening is part of that. And I I think that drugs. They do test for drugs in that capacity. But it's not their exclusive. It's just part it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. <SEP> Yeah. But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field. What is the nature of your company's business? Well it's actually uh. We do oil well services. So a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies. And they go out to. We have engineers who uh go out to the oil well to the to the client's oil well and and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff. So the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their their you know territory and everything. But the thing that's interesting is that I w- I'm an engineer and a software engineer. Um. <SEP> And I work in the software uh house. And everybody there you know are all software engineers. They've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything. And yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh th- all the engineers have to to. Well a little different actually. But uh you know we have to go through the same thing. And it's but it's uh it's a little different I guess than than a lot of drug policies. In our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you. And then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away. Oh really? Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that. But a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first. Particularly like uh we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol. And tha- they didn't find any problem with that you know. But. Right. <SEP> Uh. We that's been an a an issue uh in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening. In fact they'll have these little parties. And people will just get. I mean I've. My brother lives where I work. And I have many a time called him to come get me you know. And uh uh but y- you know they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know. Yeah. But uh I think drug testing. And I I don't know. I guess I k- I think it's got some relevance. But I think its relevance is pretty limited. I mean I think you know. In your case I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. <SEP> Yeah. I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. Yeah. It's really it's really bizarre. Uh particularly like where we are you know. I I. There was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle. And she she was a personnel secretary. And she had to get tested. And I don't know. I'm ambivalent about the whole thing. I you know I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if you know. They're they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense. And you know it's like you're I mean employments are contractual by nature anyway. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that where I had to uh uh do a drug test. And and it's it was kind of a long story. But it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through. And it amounted to uh going in uh before any of these interviews. I'm not even working for this company. I'm going in for like interviews. And they flew me out to Chicago. And and uh before I went into any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical. They said it was going to be a physical you know. And uh actually bec- beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening. But I had forgotten about that. And so basically I'd already peed off in that morning. And and when I got in there I didn't I wasn't like able to give a full sample. And so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again. Oh. Right. <SEP> And the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating. You go in there with the doctor. He makes you take off all your clothes. And then he examines you.
sw4659.txt:What do you think? Well uh I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago uh because I'm not that old yet. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um. I can be. But go ahead. Uh I know that uh. I mean obviously you look at at technologic- the technological aspect of of social change. I mean you didn't have uh you didn't have video games. You didn't have home computers. You didn't have Xerox machines. Right. <SEP> I mean uh you you try to. You go into a a business today. And you you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper. And it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and and everything have become such you know su- such a a par- a part of the way we live. Right. We fax everything. And. <SEP> Yeah. We don't even wait for the mail anymore. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Yeah uh. A business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail. And you had to do something. This was concerning the S E C. And so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail. Right. And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute. Because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> And because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder. Right. Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute. You're expected to. Exactly. And I recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse. It should be less because we have a microwave. And our grandmothers had to bake brownies. And we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes. But the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we have no down time. Like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to. Yeah. So we keep moving. We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen. We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing. So we have no relaxation time in between. <SEP> Uh-huh. So they say that's really a bad thing. That you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things. Uh-huh. So that's good. That's an interesting point. But I just think our our family lives have changed drastically. <SEP> And I think that's ju-. Of course a part of it is technology. I mean our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their T V shows. And no-. Some of that is really bad I think. But we have all single families. So many single families now. Uh a lot of working. Both parents are working. So there's a whole big effect on our kids. And not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father. You know I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years. Well there's that. And there's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen. I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country. <SEP> You're probably right. And I'm an O B nurse. And that's never really occurred to me but that's that's interesting. I never really thought about it that way. Yeah. Yeah. I saw that the numbers on that awhile back. And I was like uh-huh. So. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. When is this good or not good. <SEP> Well uh In terms of the long term effect effect on on America in terms of the culture and everything I don't know. We don't know that yet. Uh Most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an ex- ex- extremely large par- part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation f- uh from immigrant parents. Yeah. I don't know either. <SEP> That's true. <SEP> And they're going to be really struggling. And I don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good. Right. Right. I mean it's no longer the the uh the accomplishment that it that it once was. And not that many people are really trying I don't think. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of scary. Huh. Well that's true. But I. It's just very very different. And I guess every ten years it's just been very different. <SEP> Yeah. So. And I don't know what's going to happen. Uh I know what I'm seeing here at m- my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers. Yeah. Tha-. And they've got their homes. And they've got.
sw4366.txt:Well Julie uh are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly? Well I don't know. My grandfather is ninety-two years old. <SEP> Uh-huh. And he is still living by himself. My grandmother died a couple of years ago. But he doesn't want to to move away. He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm. Uh-huh. And he recently had to have an operation. But he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home. <SEP> Is he able to uh still do everything himself pretty well? Well he was until this operation. He has arthritis. Oh yeah. And now I don't really think he's doing that well. And my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him. And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot. <SEP> Yeah. But uh my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three. Uh-huh. And uh died six weeks after they put him in the home. <SEP> Yeah. And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f- grandfather's feelings. Because uh I th- you know I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left. And and for for I'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over. Uh-huh. And I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so I you know I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> They have can look after a lot of things. But there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. Uh I know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home. And they died. But they were all goodness younger than your grandparents. Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing. Uh but I did uh you know I guess. Uh when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do take care of themselves physically. Uh. But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job. And that's that's difficult part. Because I think what they often get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I know like here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in level in four levels. And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care. Generally are not able to look after this- themselves to very to a very great extent physically. Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease or those or or physical and mental handicaps. Uh you know where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. Even though it may be minimal. Uh-huh. And uh but I think that it can be helpful in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need. Uh. But I don't I mean. At least I mean I think some nursing homes do that. But I think a lot of nursing homes really uh are guilty of neglect. <SEP> Yeah. I th- and I think it happens more in areas where it's uh I guess uh a broad social medical system where uh you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing. If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals. And and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding. I think that a majority of the places in the U S uh you know there is some government aid available. But the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay. Uh-huh. And uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely.
sw4340.txt:What kind of crime do you think uh is the most prevalent in our society? Oh boy probably uh robberies people stealing from each other. Such as New York City? <SEP> Is that what happens up there a lot? Uh th- that that's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen. That's the most prevalent crime. Uh the ones that really you know the ones that really add up after a while I guess you know from s- far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs. You know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually. Yeah. I I I wonder if uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because I mean so many people use it. And even though just using is not really. I mean it is a crime. Oh well yeah. That that that is a crime. I guess uh when you when you count all the little things that people do like. Uh speeding is a crime. Well that's true. <SEP> I break that law every day. But I was I I was staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use. Uh-huh. Well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor. But uh what kind what kind. Have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything? <SEP> Well I've uh I've been caught with marijuana before. So I guess that was a crime. I got a year's probation for that. But uh. That that's not that much. I mean you know those aren't. No. It wasn't that big a deal. <SEP> I. Uh when I think of crime I think of stuff that that affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped. I think rape is one of the worst crimes. Yeah. I think it is. I in some ways it's almost worse than murder. <SEP> Yeah. It's very degrading. Uh. And Yeah. Murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to. <SEP> You know I mean it is a rather final solution though. Yeah. Right. Once once a person's you know gone then it's. But the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life you know. Yes. What what do you think is uh is an appropriate uh punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that. <SEP> Well for for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is. It's a pretty good thing. I agree with that. <SEP> They they have that down here in Florida still. They the electric chair. And uh. Yeah. I think Virginia does too up here. Oh do they? Yeah. I think I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy. And I guess usually they're they're always sure they got the right guy. But uh. Yeah. I think the appeal process takes too long. <SEP> Yeah. So do I. I think I I think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year. Yeah. I- if that. You know the sooner. A a a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out I guess. Uh-huh. <SEP> Then you know there's been guys in jail for six years. And the other guy admits that he did it. And they. It's like oops. But Uh-huh. Well yeah. I mean the system isn't perfect. I mean it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans. You do the best you can to make it perfect you know. You you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect. <SEP> Right. But I think you have to accept some of the errors. I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment uh for murderers. Um yeah. I don't know if it would or not though. I I don't think it's a so much of a deterrent as as it is a a good uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members. You know what I mean? And society probably too. <SEP> Yeah. I mean just general society to. Yeah. It kind of gets it off their chest. Uh. <SEP> Yeah. It does. And and it decreases the prison population. And which is significant. <SEP> Yeah. I know that a a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other. I mean Yeah. <SEP> And they're the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that. I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead. But I y- y- you might be able to uh stop people you know. They're thinking about it. They know they're going to get the chair if they get caught. Yeah. Generally the crimes of passion and things like that uh are not premeditated. <SEP> Right. I mean they can be. But usually they aren't. Yeah. They're spur of the moment. <SEP> That's right. And uh the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those those individuals I think that you you end up with a uh uh how do I want to you end up with a s- you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. They could p- probably do it again. Yes. They they would have no problems doing it again. That's right. They didn't have any time doing it the first time. Uh-huh. And I think locking them up for you know fifty years doesn't do a any good because as a as a taxpayer I'm going to pay you know one and a. <SEP> No. It do-.
sw4519.txt:Your turn. Oh I I start. Okay. Well uh we keep a budget to an extent. Uh and really i- i- we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm I'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh uh restrictions. And you need to make sure all your bills are paid. Uh about yourself? Well I have to say I really don't have a budget. Both my wife and I uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means. And uh our family income at this point is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say. And uh we're both so uh frugal that uh we really don't need a budget you know. We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing. <SEP> Yeah. Well I guess that really is sort of uh keeping a budget. You know. You stay within your uh within your means. Well we stay within our means. But we don't do it uh by conscious effort. It just sort of happens automatically. <SEP> Yeah. Although we just moved to California. And uh the cost of living here in California is uh I would say rather pathological. Yes. Uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than uh uh they were where I came from in uh Dallas. <SEP> Oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco. Yeah. So uh uh that presents a a real shock. That is a hugh difference. <SEP> Yeah. Ac- ac- actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California. But. But you have good sour dough. And it's a beautiful place to live. Yeah. It's God's country. <SEP> Yeah. Uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it. Uh so budget is not a problem for us. Uh at least it hasn't been. It may may be at this point. But uh up until this point it really hasn't been. When I uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago I uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that you know in my discipline was like oh six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I noted at that point that I was you know if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever. So I stopped worrying about money. Yeah. And it. Never have worried about money since then. <SEP> Well that that's a system too. Sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should. But uh I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments. But. Well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips. And you do obviously have enough to live on. So I guess you're indirectly budgeting. Uh just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal uh in spending the money. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I mean that's that's a form of budgeting I would think. It's it's kind of a strange topic to to try to for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money. Well I guess we're both lucky in that regard then. Yeah. How big is your family? <SEP> Uh well we're we have one on the way. I see. Uh my wife. And then we're we're having one on the way in uh in uh September. So how. You whe- once you get ten children though you may have. <SEP> No. I think it's just going to be one. Oh all right. How about yourself? I have two kids. Uh one nine and one thirteen. <SEP> Oh. And they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point. Do they budget at all? I mean do you have them on an allowance? I give them a I give them an allowance. And they uh. I basically give my son ten dollars a week. And I put half of it in the bank. And I give give him the other half in cold cash. <SEP> Yeah. And uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wi- do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank. But at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket. Yeah. If he wants to use it he has to go get it. And that usually.
sw4327.txt:Right. Uh actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years. I lived in Germany. And in Germany they don't have the jury system. What they do is they have uh three judges basically. And you get up there. And the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence. And your defense attorney presents their evidence. And those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not. Ou- ou- our judicial system is in such total chaos. <SEP> I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it. I mean when you have a man that's signed a a a statement saying he's guilty. We have a a family called All day family. They were all murdered. Uh-huh. All the people signed confessions. They went to a trial by jury. They been trying these people now for twenty-two years ever since I was a child. Wow. <SEP> And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done. Has nothing to do with justice whatsoever. Well you know it's it's one of those things. I mean uh uh I would have to look at it. I- if they did it with the uh just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight. Because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures. They know what's good and what isn't. They'd be able to say I'm sorry. You can't use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever. And you know you wouldn't have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury. And then the judge says oh no. D- disregard that. Come on. Any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know. Uh that's true. I I I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself. That may very well be. <SEP> I I hold it in the utmost contempt. Uh. The uh d- my favorite is the police department. They're not aimed at the criminal. The judicial system is aimed at the citizens. Because you and I we have work schedules. We can be called at work. We have Social Security numbers. They can trace us down. We have telephones. Then we have checkbooks. Criminals have none of these things. They're real difficult to catch. And if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check. Yeah. <SEP> So where do you think they target their efforts? That's true. You d-. They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals. Well How would you go about changing it? <SEP> You know that's a. I've nailed the problem down. But I. <SEP> Leave the details up to somebody else huh. Yeah. I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about. I think to begin with you would h- you would have. Like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical. Yet you go out on the streets. And they're giving speeding tickets. Yeah. <SEP> I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from. Well you know uh talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases. It's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh V C R or television repair. If you take your T V in a lot of these T V repair places will say well I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars. And if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it. He he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars. Now if he comes in and says you know I'll repair your your V C R or somebody else's V C R for a hundred dollars gets in there. Maybe it's a blown fuse. Takes him two minutes. He fixes it. He still charges you that hundred dollars. So maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it's a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case. And that's it. Now I firmly believe in that. None of this. <SEP> Because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney? Oh yeah. And here's this bum that didn't have a job. Yeah. <SEP> And he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford. That's true. Who's paying for that? Yeah. <SEP> Um y- well you you know you're talking to part of them that's paying for that. Yeah. And you're talking to the other half that's paying for it. That's right. You know that's it it's it's amazing. And and when you stop and look at it I mean the judges th- they're all former lawyers. <SEP> Yeah. Well that's another problem. I think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it. I mean they're they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever. And with that type person running it I mean you you could expect that you.
sw4679.txt:Why don't you go ahead and start. Okay. Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement. Uh trial by jury is good. But a lot of time i- a lot of cases uh is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness. And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me. I don't know. So you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit not to convict people on circumstantial evidence? <SEP> I think so. You know I I attended a trial in uh Germany when I was a student. And uh that's the sort of system they have. Uh-huh. The trials are held by a panel of three uh three or four judges who are well. They're like lawyers I guess. They're experts in the law. <SEP> Right. And uh there there really isn't a jury. And uh uh they do the questioning also. The judges do the questioning. And uh they. Uh-huh. Uh i-. I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh uh the judge is also sort of a jury uh. But I'm not sure I like that. I think I prefer the jury system myself. <SEP> You think you prefer the jury? You think your chances are better? Uh well actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury. What what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual. That's where you really need a jury of peers. Because uh anytime th- the government uh is the government against the individual you need som- y- you need the protection of ordinary citizens. Well that's true. I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is uh uh there ought to be a a well. I guess I don't think that uh uh juries need to decide sentencing all the time. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think maybe th- a judge is a better judge of that. Or uh. Well s- sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair. I mean even if well the jury I guess they do decide that. But but I'm like you. In a case like that most of the time its. I don't know. Maybe I'm too too uh uh conservative when it comes to that. Th- the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know uh. Yeah. <SEP> Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent. That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe. Right. But people who d- don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe uh a little bit naive. <SEP> Yeah. In Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people. Uh-huh. Uh it's kind of uh uh a hanging jury atmosphere. <SEP> Right. But in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way. But I guess I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it. Some some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that. Oh really? I kind of like that system. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That's that's not a bad system. But I I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit. Yeah. But the thing is too maybe they need more of a I don't know more of a expert types to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an- and call them in. Yeah. <SEP> Right. And lawyers blow sand in their eyes. <SEP> Exactly. I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries. Right. Exactly. Insurance cases and things like that. <SEP> Yeah. Where. And uh there would be more honest settlements instead of this uh tugging of people's heart strings and uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering. Uh-huh. Put- putting on a act or whatever. <SEP> Uh-huh. Exactly. Exactly. So. In I think i- in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government. But.
sw4649.txt:Uh I've had uh three boys through I guess uh some child care each one of them. And now they're in school. So it's all over. But uh I guess I would say it's not easy to find wha- what most parents would want. Well I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months. Is that right. I guess uh the only rule uh I can think of is that I like to look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that. If they're associated with a college or a university they're usually a pretty good bet. <SEP> Huh. Uh I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something. You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care. I guess not. Usu-. I suppose you're absolutely right there. Yeah. For profit places I would really look at them awfully carefully. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh when I was when my kids were young I was teaching at a university. And uh the child care center associated with our university was quite good. So I felt confident that they'd do right. Uh-huh. <SEP> Of. Aren't don't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? For their per- for their pet theories or some such thing? Oh you mean uh learning type uh yeah? I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission. Yes. But yeah. I suppose uh if you're if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another. I guess that's true. But uh I never had bad experience in that respect. Of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents. And they you know. Pretty good people. <SEP> Um. Well the thing I really worry about is uh the sexual abuse cases you read about. Uh-huh. And I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened. Yeah. I never really worry very much about it. I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public. So I never really worried too much about that being uh uh the case with my boys. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh. Uh I you know I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them. But. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't think it's as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe. Uh-huh. And another thing is cost. Oh yeah. I mean that. <SEP> I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now. And they finding in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare. Right. Um. Well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were uh in school. And I'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult. And I think it was the right thing to do. <SEP> Um. And we were uh we just decided that we would do it. And we went ahead. But uh not everybody can make that choice. And even even though my wife wasn't working we did have uh one or another of the boys in uh child care for part-ti- just for part of the day. Uh or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on. So So we did look around. Huh. I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not. And uh so I would always trust her judgment on that. <SEP> Huh. Huh. Well I'm just thanking heaven. My husband just got a new job. His last company he was only working four days a week. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's. And he just got a new job. He's getting lots of overtime. He got a pay raise. And so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not. There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid. So yeah do it as long you can. I suppose. But I think you know you have to look through a place. And you have to get a feel for uh how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I think you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open. That you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth. And if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere yeah. <SEP> You have to start wondering if they don't want you. Yes. Right. <SEP> Huh. You have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care? Uh I have one. But I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while. Uh-huh. So. But I really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and uh pay and exhaustion and you know things like that rather than these uh uh really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy. <SEP> This is true. Yeah. CURRENT AFFAIR can get several shows child cases. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well.
sw4890.txt:Uh with regard to uh to jury trials. I you know I I really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated n- body of law. And if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I I really don't think it they can really do much of anything to change it. What do you think? <SEP> Uh I I don't think so. Possibly in the jury selection would be the only. Just for example what we're seeing in California I guess. It makes you wonder uh had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome. Uh and th- and the problems that that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating. Uh just makes you wonder I guess whether or not they. Well won't. Well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that. But then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know the other two guys sat in the car. That's that's bad. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they didn't get beat up. You know. No. It. Rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh uh just like the burning and looting is self-destruct. Uh-huh. Everybody says well this is the nineties. <SEP> Oh yes. And they're going to rebuild. And it'll be even better. Hey what do you think. You know some some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area? That's right. With everybody with that mind set. They they're they're going to that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto you know. <SEP> They're only going to suffer. And you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know. T- they're only going to suffer. They they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence. Uh I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape. And uh. Well e- everybody is saying this is going to be a new era. And we're going to reexamine this thing. Hey the b- the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed. They're a bunch of animals you know. How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything. Forty deaths. I mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that. <SEP> I know. Yeah. It's really ridiculous. And I'm just trying to determine you know how you address how you weigh you know Rodney getting getting the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths. <SEP> Against forty other people being. Yeah. And there's no other. I'm not su- exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths. And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing. Those deaths. <SEP> Uh-huh. Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner? I you know. No tears. Or just a by- an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what. Yeah. And and so I but I I suspect a number of them. <SEP> Um. You know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street. <SEP> Or or beaten. And and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before rather than stop. And uh and there there would have been just nothing but carnage after after after if I'd been at the wheel. Um. No one would have stopped me. <SEP> Right. That's that's exactly how I feel too. I wouldn't have uh they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had I seen them coming. But I was just wondering since you're you're in you're back east uh and a little closer to the the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here. Right. I'm inside the beltway. <SEP> Oh. You know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus. And so and I say well wait a minute. I'm inside the beltway. And I don't think like that. Uh-huh. I'm a government employee. <SEP> Oh. In what uh section of the government do you work? I'm with the F B I. Oh. Oh that's interesting. Yes. An- and so uh uh and and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick who's another government employee wanted a spe- segments of my speech that that were done a year ago. <SEP> <SEP> Uh-huh. And he wanted another collection a year later. Oh. And so this is my seventh call. A year ago I did eleven calls. <SEP> Oh I see. And so that's that's why uh uh that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique you know I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate.
sw4908.txt:Uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers. And we keep the newspapers in a in a. They're collected twice a month and the trash and and this bottled stuff that is put in a in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck. So they ma- actually have about three passes at this collection. One for the regular trash one for the uh uh you know the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers. Sounds. <SEP> But I gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans. No. They they do that on the truck. Uh-huh. <SEP> They separate them as they as they you know dump them. And you know one guy comes around with his truck and and dumps it all in there. And I think they're they're running out of uh you know. The sanitary landfill I think uh is you know running out. Of course uh you being from New Mexico you've probably been n- to Washington. Especially if you're your present location. Yes. You must have come to Washington at least once. Yes. I know. Not only have I come to Washington but uh I find it very amusing that uh the thing that was just instituted here is very similar. That is we also have blue bins. We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and uh landfill space is in deed the driving factor here. And in fact uh despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still uh very hard to come by. <SEP> My you've got a lot a a lot of nothing out there. You know. A-. They got. I mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could you could use for landfill. Ah. But if somebody can make a regulation about it they will. <SEP> Well what other we- we- what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what in Los Alamos? Well uh. Uh other other than nuking it. Yes. Other than nuking it. <SEP> Um in fact Los Alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general. Um it it involves for instance uh creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general. And uh and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements. Well isn't that a that's a that's pretty uh upscale uh trash uh uh situation. I don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals. <SEP> And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has uh ter- made some special uh polymers that have the ability to uh make certain actinide elements adhere to them. Uh uh they've uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste. <SEP> Huh. And again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh E S and H uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about I think much more than they should. Actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable. We-. Back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the uh paper from the computer center. And uh in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable pa- recycled paper. <SEP> Huh. Well that's certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things. I I think it should be i- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy. You y- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know. Uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound. I I think I think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff. I think that's a wonderful idea. <SEP> The only alternative I would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain. Uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill. Uh-huh. And it would also cause people to compact their garbage more. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight. <SEP> Well of course that uh you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor.
sw4314.txt:. Well we have. We used to when I was younger. Yeah. <SEP> We'd go every weekend. All right. But we haven't done m- l- whole lot of it lately. Yeah. I'm kind of into it. I'm uh kind of a sailor. <SEP> Yeah. I'm up in Minneapolis now. But I was in Florida. So uh yeah. I was kind of into it for a while there. Were you sailboating? Yeah. For the most part. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I had a little sail. Well we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here. No. <SEP> Just motorboat's all we. What part of Texas you from? Uh Nacogdoches. Okay. Whereabouts is that? <SEP> That's between Houston and Dallas. Okay. All right. It's the oldest town in Texas. Is that right? <SEP> Yeah. Wow. That's pretty wild. We have uh Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches. So we do a lot of boating on. Okay. So you got some lakes around you can do that on. <SEP> Yeah. You do skiing and stuff. Or. Yeah. Little bit. Yeah? All right. <SEP> Just got through snow skiing. Yeah? Yeah. All right. <SEP> Just came back from Denver. But. Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah. We've uh our. The snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now. Yeah. It it it was heavy when we were there though. Yeah. <SEP> I didn't see any boats there though. Not not not too many no. But uh no. I just got back from a weekend. We went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing. It was pretty nice. But uh no I I have uh I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I do did a lot of sailing on and stuff. <SEP> Yeah? That's a lot of fun. But uh my parents are pretty big sailors too. They're kind of into it. Uh all we all we have up here mostly bass boats. Oh yeah. I guess it's pretty uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh? <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Lot of lot of fishing going on up here. Yeah. All right. So where about in Texas is that? Is that centrally located. Or. <SEP> It's uh well. You ever heard of Lufkin? Uh no. What what major city is nearby? Houston. Okay. And that's south or north of there or something? <SEP> Let me see. Houston's north. Yeah? Okay. Dallas is south. Oh okay. All right. Well that sounds pretty good. Does uh. I guess the weather. Does that stay pretty constant there. Or. <SEP> It's it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons. Yeah? Probably seventies eighties in the afternoon. Okay. Well that's pretty temperate. Yeah. That's not too bad. But uh yeah. Have you done uh any other boating then. Or. <SEP> No. I hadn't done any in a l- uh lately. But that's all. I used to ha- uh have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop. Yeah? And we used to when I was in high school we used to go out go boating every day just about. Oh that's great. Yeah. I. <SEP> And we had a n- different boat every day. Oh that's fantastic. Yeah. I used to uh kind of be that way myself when I lived in uh north western Florida in the panhandle. I used to sail about every day. I'd work go to work. I'd like to do some sailing. Yeah. It's a lot of fun. It's uh. Especially if you get a a pretty fast boat. Like those catamarans are pretty fast. <SEP> Yeah. What. You can actually. Do if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that. Or they just. Well actually I I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life. Uh my family's pretty into it. <SEP> Yeah. And uh I took sailing lessons when I was about six. And then uh. Is it pretty easy? Yeah. It it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know uh just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it. <SEP> Yeah. So it's it's not too bad. It's pretty easy to get the hang of I think. And uh generally everybody I've I've known has kind of gotten into it. But some people are more motorboaters you know which is fine. Yeah. <SEP> Well that's about all we have. Yeah. Yeah. Lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing. But then again they may nev- m- they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran. Uh-huh. And uh that's when you really start getting into speed. You know. You actually some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers. They get so fast you know. <SEP> I didn't know that. Yeah. They get pretty quick. But. That that would be something. Uh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I haven't I haven't personally done that. But uh the races. I I work with a guy right now that uh races catamarans in the summertime. Uh-huh. And uh he's pretty gassed about it. He's got a good uh. <SEP> What kind of what lake do you all use? Well he uh he's from Detroit. Uh-huh. So he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes I think and does his sailing. Uh. For me I I go back to Orlando uh in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast. We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast. And there's a lot of places there you can go you know. So uh so that's a good thing. <SEP> Yeah. But yeah so what do you do for a job? Uh I build transformers. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. Okay. Is that for T I. Or. No. It's for Cooper Industries. Okay. Are they primarily electronic then? <SEP> Yeah. Okay. Well. Well that. <SEP> They have a you know worldwide. But. Right. W- all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that. Oh okay. <SEP> Great. Yeah. How do you like it down there in Texas? It's real nice. Yeah? <SEP> Been here all my life. Oh no doubt. Yeah. Okay. I've never been to Texas. I've been to Oklahoma. But uh that's about as far as. <SEP> Oh it's n- Oklahoma's nothing like it. Yeah? Okay. Well that's good because I didn't like Oklahoma that well.
sw4834.txt:I guess I guess by what you said you're you don't feel your uh privacy has been inva- invaded anytime recently? No. Not really. Uh u- th- uh th- the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's the only thing that bothers me. That's not really invading my privacy. Right. Uh do you feel that yours is invaded? Uh no. I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. Uh you know I would. There there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot. And you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that. And it's real hard to to tell them you know that you're not interested. Or you do tell them you're not interested. And they still keep asking you you know and keep badgering you about it. And that aggravates me. But I don't know that you could call that invading of invading my privacy. Because you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know I want my name unlisted or want my you know. <SEP> But but that doesn't work. It doesn't? Uh no. Because they a lot of times they dial sequentially. They get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something. You put your phone number on there. They pass your phone number on to another company. Oh. Uh or you uh. Or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or s- and stuff. They even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe. <SEP> And uh while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they. Uh-huh. You call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing. <SEP> And the lo- local local papers ask them to remove your na- number from their list. And uh yeah. You call up their regular during regular hours. Their uh they have a special department. They'll take your numbers out of their lists. Uh-huh. Uh but the uh Orlando paper uh yeah they they refused to take it off of the lists. And they call every month. Huh. <SEP> And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have. Good grief. Well let me ask you about this. Here's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately. My fiance received a bill from a a Lord and Taylor company. Uh you know they're a they're a department store. <SEP> Uh-huh. She received a bill from them uh that she had visited some sto-. And and I think it was there in Florida. Maybe it was in Miami. That uh she had visited a store there. And uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise. Uh-huh. Uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number. Uh-huh. Uh and and I've I've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- you know. They use Joe Blow's so- uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit. <SEP> Uh-huh. If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address i- and their mother's maiden name uh you can basically become that uh person. Huh. <SEP> Uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to. Uh-huh. And since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her. Uh if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would ha- whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of uh you know document. Yeah. <SEP> And uh wh-. The signature uh. They should be able to provide you a copy with that signature. And if they can't provide a signature you know they'll have to eat the charge. Yeah. Well y-. But if the pers- has you know their social s- her social security number I'd be real concerned that they uh that she's not uh blacklist on uh Tel- what is it it's Telecredit or something? Yeah. <SEP> Uh because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there. She probably won't be ab- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle. Yeah. Well we got it cleared up eventually. What happened uh.
sw4785.txt:Kids too? Yeah. Oh you laugh. How many. What ages? <SEP> Well twenty-seven up. Uh. And we had five. You've been through the fun part. <SEP> Oh yeah. And how about yourself? I have a four and a half and a three. <SEP> Oh. Well. So. It's. I I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way in the way it's done now and then. Yeah. Well when mine were growing up I did some traveling and but not that extensively. But I always just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them. Yeah. <SEP> So it was an hour you know. Yeah. But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them. What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest? <SEP> Six years. So they were all real close? Yeah. That's tough. That's a lot of time. <SEP> Oh yeah. We look back and wonder how we did it. Did you both work? Your wife too? No. She never did. Uh well qualify that. <SEP>. She worked at home I'm sure. Well yeah. Yeah. But that's uh. Well both my husband and I work. And sometimes I feel like you know by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening. <SEP> Yeah. Maybe thirty minutes max. Well that's plenty though. And well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking. And then I spend time with them while you know he's doing other stuff. And and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend. You know there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it. But it's neat. It's straight. And I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids you know. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Well you know with kids you're not going to have a neat house. Well I've accepted that too. <SEP> And you know it it's tough to find time. E- espec- especially with both of them working. That's true. It is. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. And you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it. Well that's true. And and we do a lot of that on the weekends you know. We try to spend Saturdays together. <SEP> Right. If my husband golfs you know he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence you know. Right. And and we do a lot of family things together. We're we're kind of going the other direction this weekend. We're planning a trip just he and I. This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago. <SEP> Well that's good too. Yeah. That's good that way too. Well I decided that you know you need that once in awhile. That you you need to plan the quality time. And and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day. <SEP> Yeah. Well that they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day. Yeah. And you know and as the kids got older I made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too. Or whatever. Sure. <SEP> Sure. And. And they think that's a family activity you know. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. That's great fun. And uh well yeah. If. My daughter's like Mommy can I help you with the laundry? Of course you can. <SEP> Yeah. Just keep them talking that way. Absolutely. Yeah. But uh another thing we used to do is have ham- family councils. Every Sunday night. Uh-huh. <SEP> And what would you do. What? Discuss everything that didn't agree with them. And we'd take turns being president. Oh. <SEP> And everyone would get one vote. And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two. Yeah. But it never worked that way. So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week. <SEP> Yeah. Well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too. And then. Oh. <SEP> And that was always good time. Boy we really got to know the kids well. I imagine. And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them. Oh yeah. In fact they were all in uh over the weekend for Easter. I. <SEP> Oh that's wonderful. See I was raised in that type of family where you know you don't disobey me you mind me. But if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it. Well we did too. Yeah. <SEP> And I remember the one daughter saying we had a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree. Uh-huh. And she said hey I don't make fun fun of your friends. So why make fun of mine? Uh well. <SEP> Kind of r- kind of hit us between the eyes. Yeah. Yeah. You don't think of it that way do you. No. But that that was always good quality time for us. Now that's good. I like that idea. <SEP> And then never attend. But if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules. Whatever was voted on huh. <SEP> Yeah. And boy they they'd show up. Well I think that's great. And we'd usually take notes. Yeah. <SEP> And you know the younger kids uh or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another. Yeah. And uh but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us. And they loved it. I I think that's true. I can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment. <SEP> Yeah. And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know. Yeah. So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves you know. <SEP> Yeah. But uh boy I I feel for you and your husband. Oh why is that? Well my my uh two of my uh.
sw4379.txt:Kathy? Uh-huh. Do you. So what is your uh family. What do you usually do as far as budgeting? <SEP> We have a very detailed budget. Because my husband is a finance major. Uh-huh. And we have you know we have money that we take out each month that we uh you know for food and and for for gas and things like that. And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for uh other things. Uh-huh. <SEP> Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year. And we budget them into what we call our our needs and wants list. Uh-huh. And so uh the things that like a vacation. We have a vacation fund. We have a fund for the things we need. And then a for the things that we want. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need. And then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item. Uh-huh. So we very rarely buy anything on credit. Everything we buy is paid for. Yeah. My husband is a finance major also. <SEP> And uh we kind of have the same plan. Uh we have one credit card. And every month we put uh you know the same amount in for retirement. Uh and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby. So we're budgeting uh each month uh an allowance for his education starting now. <SEP> Right. Right. So that's in our budget every month now. That's the newest addition. But we too do the same thing as far as uh. We have a set amount. We take oh one big vacation a year and then maybe you know three small vacations. So we you know an exact amount that we spend on that each year. <SEP> Right. And. <SEP> Uh we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money. Uh instead of just writing checks for things. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here. I see. And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for uh the vacation. That we put in for Christmas. Like you have a separate account for that then? <SEP> Well a lot of that uh I don't know how safe it is. I guess uh we keep it all in a safe here at the house. Oh I see. Uh-huh. And so it's actually pulled out. Then we keep our. Oh I see. <SEP> We have a savings account for the kids' education. That money goes into there. Uh-huh. Each of our. We have three children. So they each have their own account. I see. <SEP> That money is put into each month. Uh-huh. Does your husband deal in uh stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff? Th- does he invest in that and for long-term? He does somewhat. <SEP> Yeah. He does somewhat. Uh-huh. Uh we have an investment plan. Yeah. I guess he does. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh we have really found. This is the first year we've done it this way. And we are really saving a lot of money. Really. Because you're you've you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to. So what goes into that that particular thing? It's vacations Christmas. <SEP> Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical. We just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental. Uh-huh. And uh and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from. Right. <SEP> We have it you know. Uh-huh. And when when we see something on sale uh instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill. Everything's taken care of. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought. Really. Yeah. Well you know uh what do you do as far as. I I take it. Do you uh run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing? <SEP> I do. Uh-huh. All the money. Uh-huh. And how what's that? All the money is turned over to me. Uh-huh. Do you have a set amount that that you spend each month. Or or how do you work that? <SEP> Yes. I have a set amount. It's very generous. And I usually have extra. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so then that can go uh you know either back into our checking account. Or I can just carry it over. Uh-huh. Uh you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months. And certain times when that will be left over. Uh-huh. <SEP> But that's completely up to me how I do that. And then uh because I don't work. I stay home. Uh-huh. I do too. I stay home also. <SEP> And so it's kind of my money. And I also get my own money to do what I want to. Go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing. Uh-huh. We have a clothing uh envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing. Uh-huh. <SEP> It really works out great. We're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that. And we're. Yeah. What what. As far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a T V or a big item like for the house. How. Do you have like a household? Yes. We have a household budget. Like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year. Uh-huh. <SEP> And also we need a new bed. And so we've got both of those budgeted. And we put a certain amount in each month. And we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those. Uh-huh. And if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards.
