Does the company you work for test for drugs? They just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting. Because when I went to work for them they didn't do that. But since then they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company requests that we do that. <SEP> How about you? We're not being tested for drugs at all. Our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section or its reasons for immediate dismissal. It says use of narcotics on company premises. <SEP> So that's pretty general. But I work for an environmental management firm. And I'm an engineer there. But I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites. But I don't operate any machinery. <SEP> Now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program. Because they're at a higher risk of exposure. And blood screening is part of that. And I think that drugs. They do test for drugs in that capacity. But it's not their exclusive. It's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. <SEP> But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field. What is the nature of your company's business? It's actually. We do oil well services. So a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies. And they go out to. We have engineers who go out to the client's oil well and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff. So the clients are very concerned that the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their territory and everything. But the thing that's interesting is that I'm an engineer a software engineer. <SEP> And I work in the software house. And everybody there are all software engineers. They never go out to the oil rigs or anything. And yet we're subjected to this policy the same one that all the engineers have to. A little different actually. But we have to go through the same thing. It's a little different than a lot of drug policies. In our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you. And then if you get injured on the job if you trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away. Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that. But a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first. Particularly we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol. And they didn't find any problem with that. But. <SEP> That's been an issue in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening. In fact they'll have these little parties. And people will just get. I've. My brother lives where I work. And I have many a time called him to come get me. But they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. But I think drug testing. And I don't know. I think it's got some relevance. But I think its relevance is pretty limited. I think. In your case I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. <SEP> I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. It's really bizarre. Particularly where we are. I. There was a story of a woman last year who actually did slip on the ice and sprained her ankle. And she was a personnel secretary. And she had to get tested. And I don't know. I'm ambivalent about the whole thing. I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if. They should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense. And it's like employments are contractual by nature anyway. <SEP> But I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job where I had to do a drug test. And it was kind of a long story. But it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through. And it amounted to going in before any of these interviews. I'm not even working for this company. I'm going in for interviews. And they flew me out to Chicago. And before I went into any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical. They said it was going to be a physical. And actually beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening. But I had forgotten about that. And so basically I'd already peed off in that morning. And when I got in there I wasn't able to give a full sample. And so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again. <SEP> And the procedure is utterly humiliating. You go in there with the doctor. He makes you take off all your clothes. And then he examines you.
