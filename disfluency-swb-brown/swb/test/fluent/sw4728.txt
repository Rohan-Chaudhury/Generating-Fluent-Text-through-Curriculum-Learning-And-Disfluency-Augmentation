I don't know what you drive now. What do you drive now? I have a Ford pickup. And the family car is a Dodge Caravan. Because we have three kids and they're under thirteen. <SEP> So. Throw them in the back. They sort of fit our requirement. I have one of those pickups with a seat in the back. Cab. <SEP> And so they just fit in there. When they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work. <SEP> Right now I can throw them all in the back when we have room. And since I do a lot of projects I throw things in the back. There you go. And I kind of like having a pickup truck. Yo-. <SEP> Actually I think of it as a car that'll last. I know. I like the way trucks are built. And I don't care about comfort. So I'm pretty happy. You're looking at. I got a Toyota Four Runner. I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too. So I got a Four Runner. <SEP> So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one. I never buy new. So I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck. You're just like me. I've never bought a new vehicle in my life. And. I don't need to pay for the glitz. I'll let somebody else have the showroom shine. <SEP> And I'll pay for the rest of it. Let somebody else break it in. And the van we're sor-. We might go again on a van. We could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time. I'm not sure. <SEP> We'll have to face it in a couple of years. But I guess we had a small Toyota wagon. <SEP> And we were real happy with that because my second requirement after price is low maintenance. And it certainly had that. We didn't do much to it at all. <SEP> My. Pretty much the same. Like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners. And it pretty much does everything I need it to. It'll tow three thousand pounds. So I can tow everything. And it. I can throw. I've had eleven people in it before. Believe it or not. <SEP> And it's real reliable. Belie-. I've had it for almost four years now. And up until two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it. And then of course two weeks ago it decided. <SEP> I don't know. It's the strangest weirdest thing in the world. But it blew a head gasket. Didn't do any damage to it. I caught it real early. <SEP> How. At how many miles? Ninety-seven thousand. <SEP> So it's not real early. You didn't overheat it? Never overheated it. I smelled the coolant. <SEP> Went out and looked. Saw where it was coming from. Drove it right to the shop and left it off. That was. And that was it. Because I have that. And then I have a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is actually usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining. <SEP>. That's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle. <SEP> It's a. I don't know. People who buy motorcycles for transportation are kidding themselves. I have one colleague that commutes to work on one when it's not raining. And he's a. It's. He's pretty conservative guy. I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess. I know. But I bet you he really enjoys riding it. <SEP> I'm sure he does. So yo-. H-. When was the last time you took your truck out just to go driving? <SEP>. And I go out twice a week on the bike. At least. Just for the enjoyment. <SEP>. <SEP> But. The only thing I think I might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but another car. I would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had just an open bed to throw stuff in. I'm sure that that's very. You got one. That's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back. And. <SEP> If I only had some place that I could store the camper top I would have it off most of the time. I really leave it on there just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty. To have it out of the way. <SEP> But they're solid. Trucks are built. I think they last a lot longer than anything else. They're the only things Americans still know how to build. And. The trucks do. Even though the little Jap trucks are good there too. But so are the. Though I think the Chevies. I don't think the Che-. I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords. <SEP> I think the Fords tend to last a little longer. At least until recently. I kind of like mine. <SEP> So mine's a Ford. A friend of mine just bought a year ago. It's a really nice truck. I don't like Dodges at all. But one of the Dodges they have out now has the Cummins turbo diesel on it. I heard about that. It's beautiful. <SEP> That thing will last forever. That's a serious truck. That thing's. It's got a boat engine in it. <SEP> This. I know a contractor who just got one of those. He's pleased with it.
