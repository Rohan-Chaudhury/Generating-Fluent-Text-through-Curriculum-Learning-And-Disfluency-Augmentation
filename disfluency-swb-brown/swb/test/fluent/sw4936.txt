Why don't you start? I don't know. I refinished a couple of old dressers that were handed down. It's nice tongue and groove construction. I've been pretty successful with that. Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that? <SEP> What? Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing? I've done some other things too. I've done both. <SEP> My wife has picked up a couple of things saying if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture. And we've done it a couple of times. I guess that we've been fairly successful with those. That's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it. <SEP> That's a good way to get started. I have a really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital liberated it after a fire. And we stripped it all the way down and refinished it. And it turned out to be a nice desk. Maple top or something of that sort. <SEP>. <SEP> I put together a rolltop desk from scratch. A kit. I'm jealous. <SEP> Still had to cut it and everything. But it was fun. I do things that might be too crude to be called woodworking. I've built my own deck and things like that. <SEP>. I've done the same. Like the trim around the house the baseboards and things like that. And I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too. <SEP> I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive. And so I do have a band saw and a router and things like that out in the garage. But I can't say I use them very often. <SEP> I'm looking at trying to get a router right now. They come in handy at the most unusual times. Putting doors in is the time when I'm. I bought myself a template for making mortices and doors. And that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel. <SEP> I'll bet. But I've also used them for rabbeting because rabbeting on my radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain. So I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it. And now I use it twice a year maybe. <SEP> My brother's used it a lot for making drawers. I don't know. The big. What's your opinion of what a good router is like? I. I guess it. <SEP> Because he was tell me the ones that you dial in aren't all that great. They've plastic parts and stuff. The ones that what? That you dial in on the side. I have never even looked at one closely. The little use that I've gotten from my router I would spend my money on the bits. <SEP>. I have a medium quality Craftsman router. And the. <SEP> How strong is it? It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than three-eighths of an inch at a time. But the problem is that as with. Any time you buy a tool as a package the bits that they give you are low end. Don't they. <SEP>. <SEP> So a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars. And if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it. Because e-. I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself they won't last. And I've never had the bits sharpened. So. That's a thing to consider is to. <SEP> They really get hot don't they? And they dull after awhile. Especially I did some cabinets in ash and oak. And that wears a bit down. We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen. <SEP> <SEP> And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth. And routing hardwood will take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast. So. <SEP> I've cut some one by eight oak before. Was that fun. That's. Big solid pieces of oak are just tough. And then you take the blade to get sharpened. <SEP> That was with a circular saw. <SEP>. Is this going to be fun? I've used mine on treated wood. And now all my blades need sharpening. Because treated wood will also chew them up. <SEP> Treated wood can really make you sick too.
