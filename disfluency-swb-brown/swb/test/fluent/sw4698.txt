Actually I've been involved in electronics a long time. In computers. And I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home. Up until maybe about a year and a half ago. I got one for my son. A Macintosh L C. <SEP> It's a real easy to use color computer. And I got a very nice printer that goes along with it. And he uses it for his school work. I'm currently in school. So I've had an I B M clone for a couple of years now which I've been continually upgrading. And I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it. And I can't really. I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer simulation or analysis. So. <SEP> It's very essential for me. Schools have them. But lot of times so difficult to get on them at school. It's much more convenient to have one at home. Where you going to school? At Georgia Tech. I see. <SEP> So. In engineering? So that explains all the computer assignments. <SEP> It. Do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work? I have some games of course which I play on there. And I have a program which allows me to access a weather data bank. So I can check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby. So it provides other means other than just strict computations and so on. So. Do you have a computer for yourself at home? I just have one for my son. And I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing. <SEP>. Tha-. At work I'm a technologist. And I in the past have done a great deal of system development just through software development programming. But now I find myself using the computer. Even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communication system. <SEP>. Do you use Email and like that? Emil probably pulls down a third of all my time. <SEP> It's. I have modem night computer. So I can log into the network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which can be useful. But. That and word processing is. While I tend to. Obviously I do almost all of my report writing on my computer whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. So it's really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember. Actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out. <SEP> And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high. So. I'm a old-timer. I did my Master's thesis on a typewriter. I rented an I B M Selectric. <SEP> And it was a pretty big deal. It must have been tough. It's a little bit strange for me. I did my Master's thesis last year. And I did that on a computer. And it seems like. I just can't imagine how people did it before. It must have been just so much work. It was just a completely different world then. <SEP> So you used your son's Macintosh then? Do you like that kind of computer? I like it. I like it from a distance really. I see the packages on it that are available. And it's nice. I really don't use it myself. When I come home from work I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things. <SEP>. So I let my son do it. And of course there's an intellectual evolution taking place where. <SEP> It's sort of a joke. But it's really true. The old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot. And the kids they just take to it like candy. If the interface is there so that it's fun to use and the challenge.
