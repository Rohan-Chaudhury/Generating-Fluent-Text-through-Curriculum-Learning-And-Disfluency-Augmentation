Type of music is hot down in Texas? I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas. I know what's hot down here with me. So that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know. I don't ever listen to the radio. And that's usually what's hot around here. What kind of music do you like? <SEP> Mostly folk music. Folk music. I find myself listening to a lot of either old timer or New England dance bands as well as just more popular folk music and new artists coming up. <SEP> We're on totally different wavelengths. I'm more old rock and roll some newer heavy metal rock and roll type Van Halen that kind of thing. <SEP> What about classic rock type stations. I don't listen to the radio at all. We live in a fairly small town. So classic rock for me is what I have which is Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix. <SEP> Some of the older Eagles stuff was good. <SEP> I didn't like. They started getting a little more. The type of music at least to me only sounds good at a high volumes. And I don't like listening at high volumes. But some of their older stuff was quite enjoyable to me. <SEP> They. Hotel California and that era. That's something doesn't even sound good loud really. <SEP> Definitely. Anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some I might know of. I don't know any folk music at all. Down in Texas listen to a little country every now and then. Here. I'm sure there's a lot of that down there. <SEP> Plenty. Way more than I can stand down here. I don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it. I. There's a Conway Twitty twang. Then there's the Dolly Parton Hollywood sound. <SEP> That's even more commercialized country music. But it's getting pretty big everywhere as I see it. Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses. I think some of them the artists are even hitting the pop charts. <SEP> It's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is. Concert tours for country and western sings it's quite odd. But I don't know. Music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays I think. It's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music. I think most artists are in to make a few bucks. And that's all it. But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do-. <SEP> Late sixties early seventies they were definitely pushing a message. That's what it. <SEP> That's what you say. And then music is wrapped around now. Now it's the other way around. I don't think Gun. At least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much to say. They don't have anything really important you want to hear. But it's kind of odd. It's like it doesn't have to be good. It's just who does it. <SEP> You hear a Paula Abdul song. And you. And I think if somebody else were to play that everybody would think that's lousy. But because she did it it's supposed to be good. It comes to the point where it's your name not what you do more than anything. Madonna can do anything. And it would be considered good because it's Madonna. <SEP> Madonna could start playing folk music. And folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it. So it's really backwards how things are working now. But. It's the artist not the merit. <SEP> I don't think that's a good thing at all. But that's the point we've reached. So I don't know how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least. I don't know. I know for myself that for the most part I don't know which artist is which. So I listen to a song. I either like the song. Or I don't like it. <SEP> And then if I really like the song eventually I'll figure out who it was. That's about how I am on popular music. I don't know enough about it because I just listen. Everything I listen to is what I buy not whatever they play on the radio. So. You have to figure out what to buy. Or do you just buy along the same artist? <SEP> I. I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time. I don't really switch around to new things very often. It's way to hectic and too confusing. So you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop? <SEP> Generally. Or about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard. And I listen to it that way. But as far as. I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it. That's one thing I like about some of the folk music scenes. There's a couple of nice small coffee houses up in New Jersey. <SEP> And it's very nice. You go into the coffee house. And an artist is there. And very often the artist will have an album. And so if you like the artist you buy the album. So you definitely get to try before you buy. <SEP> That's definitely. I. It. You don't always quite get it right.
