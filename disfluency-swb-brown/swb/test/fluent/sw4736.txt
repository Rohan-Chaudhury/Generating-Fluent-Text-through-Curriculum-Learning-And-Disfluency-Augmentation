Capital punishment out in California has had a lot of discourse in the paper. Apparently they haven't executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe. That's as far back as I can remember. That's before my time actually. They. <SEP> We lived in Redwood City when we were out there. And we found that it was a very liberal kind of community. But I really feel that the law enforcement community puts these people behind bars. And then these lawyer groups get together. And they extend beyond the normal appeal process. And just drag his ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years. And I think that there's something that has to be changed in the system to do that. I think capital punishment was probably stringent enough. But I think the appeal process is really getting in the way. <SEP> Do you feel as though there should be more transgressions that would be enforceable by capital punishment? I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not. It's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself. It's at that point where they're saying here you're going on death row. But you'll stay there for twenty years. <SEP> And nothing is being done about it. The laws exist and are frequently upheld in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find. And it's really getting out of hand in many states. The term technicality. The law enforcement community has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous acts are done to get somebody into a situation where they're going to be guilty of a crime. <SEP> And whether the rights of that individual have been impuned. Or whether a policeman has just made a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it. But the merits of the case in terms of the guy was a law breaker as being supportive. I'm at this juncture. I'm not sure what constitutes a technicality. That's what all these hearings are about. And that's what all these court cases are about. Our glorious mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of the can. And he tried to appeal his conviction. And it didn't work. But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry. In the old days and round about times of battle of Hastings the villages if you were a transgressor they either drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody. And you were his slave. And if he didn't like what you did he killed you. <SEP> And that's pretty effective. It's not good for civil rights I guess. But it's pretty effective in that you've got to get along in the community. And if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods. As man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions especially murder cases and that sort of thing. It seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished. And the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off. For instance there's a case a few years back where someone who was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that. The arresting officer did not read the defendant their rights. <SEP> And where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet.
