Actually. I don't think I'm in the majority in Texas. I don't think I agree with. <SEP>. You don't believe in it? I wouldn't say that. I think I would have said that a few years ago. <SEP> When I was younger I thought it was a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have capital punishment. But maybe slowly changing my opinion. I'm not thoroughly opposed to it. I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment. But I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought. <SEP> You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A girl I hang out with. She has very black and white opinions. There's no gray in her opinions. She probably would agree more with you. But I don't know. I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again. I've never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family. <SEP> But I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done. And we see that more and more. In our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl. <SEP> That's fourteen years old. What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult. I certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose. I'm not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail. But. <SEP> It doesn't. But it costs less. That's a factor. <SEP> And. To me it is. I work and I pay my taxes. And I lived out in Texas for a little while. And they're. And that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia. You guys are a lot more for to each his own even than we are in Georgia. But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part. If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine. <SEP> But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore. <SEP> I. The cost is something. But I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime. And I guess I would like. I don't know. The European countries certainly none of them have capital punishment. And they don't have a crime problem either. <SEP> You can't. They don't execute anybody in Britain or France. And I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either. And they don't have the crime problems we do. I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two. I guess what worries me about capital punishment is when I see people enthusiastic about it and sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing. And that bothers me. <SEP> You might be right. But it. But. I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch. <SEP> I would never in a million years want that job. But I do believe it's necessary. And I. <SEP> On the one hand I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing. And I couldn't pull the switch. But. Actually I wha-. The other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else. I think it just becomes a symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians. So. <SEP> I would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed. Like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country. <SEP> I'm not so sure of that. I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around. <SEP> What's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing? I guess I'm. My view of. My. I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that costs and other factors justify executing people. <SEP> Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture than anything else. And I've also never been a victim although I have two friends whose wives were murdered. And I can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case. <SEP> If it ever touched my fam-.
