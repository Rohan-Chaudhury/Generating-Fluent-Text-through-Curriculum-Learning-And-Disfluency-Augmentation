Kids too? You laugh. How many. What ages? <SEP> Twenty-seven up. And we had five. You've been through the fun part. <SEP> And how about yourself? I have a four and a half and a three. <SEP>. So. It's. I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way it's done now and then. When mine were growing up I did some traveling but not that extensively. But I always just made it a point to spend about ten minutes with each one of them. <SEP> So it was an hour. But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them. What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest? <SEP> Six years. So they were all real close? That's tough. That's a lot of time. <SEP> We look back and wonder how we did it. Did you both work? Your wife too? She never did. Qualify that. <SEP>. She worked at home I'm sure. But that's. Both my husband and I work. And sometimes I feel like by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening. <SEP> Maybe thirty minutes max. That's plenty though. And he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking. And then I spend time with them while he's doing other stuff. And of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend. There's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it. But it's neat. It's straight. And I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids. <SEP>. With kids you're not going to have a neat house. I've accepted that too. <SEP> And it's tough to find time. Especially with both of them working. That's true. It is. <SEP> That's true. And you just have to set the time and say this is going to be it. That's true. And we do a lot of that on the weekends. We try to spend Saturdays together. <SEP> If my husband golfs he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence. And we do a lot of family things together. We're kind of going the other direction this weekend. We're planning a trip just he and I. This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago. <SEP> That's good too. That's good that way too. I decided that you need that once in awhile. That you need to plan the quality time. And I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day. <SEP> They say all it takes is about five ten minutes a day. And as the kids got older I made them help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too. Or whatever. <SEP> And. And they think that's a family activity. <SEP>. That's great fun. And. If. My daughter's Mommy can I help you with the laundry? Of course you can. <SEP> Just keep them talking that way. But another thing we used to do is have family councils. Every Sunday night. <SEP> And what would you do. What? Discuss everything that didn't agree with them. And we'd take turns being president. <SEP> And everyone would get one vote. And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two. But it never worked that way. So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week. <SEP> And we could bring up stuff too. And then. <SEP> And that was always good time. We really got to know the kids well. I imagine. And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them. In fact they were all in over the weekend for Easter. I. <SEP> That's wonderful. I was raised in that type of family where you don't disobey me you mind me. But if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it. We did too. <SEP> And I remember the one daughter saying we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree. And she said I don't make fun of your friends. So why make fun of mine? <SEP> Kind of hit us between the eyes. You don't think of it that way do you. But that was always good quality time for us. That's good. I like that idea. <SEP> And then never attend. But if they missed it they had to abide by the rules. Whatever was voted on. <SEP> And they'd show up. I think that's great. And we'd usually take notes. <SEP> And the younger kids or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another. But they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us. And they loved it. I think that's true. I can remember times my parents would say what do you think would be a fair punishment. <SEP> And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done. So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves. <SEP> But I feel for you and your husband. Why is that? Two of my.
