I guess by what you said you don't feel your privacy has been invaded anytime recently? Not really. The only thing that annoys me is when people call and you have solicitation calls. <SEP> That's the only thing that bothers me. That's not really invading my privacy. Do you feel that yours is invaded? I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. I would. There's a lot of times though you get those calls when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot. And next thing you know someone calls and wants to sell you this or that. And it's real hard to tell them that you're not interested. Or you do tell them you're not interested. And they still keep asking you and keep badgering you about it. And that aggravates me. But I don't know that you could call that invading my privacy. Because if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look I want my name unlisted or want my. <SEP> But that doesn't work. It doesn't? Because a lot of times they dial sequentially. They get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything. <SEP> You enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something. You put your phone number on there. They pass your phone number on to another company. Or you. Or the newspapers they just dial randomly and stuff. The newspapers here even call people who already subscribe. <SEP> And while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they. You call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing. <SEP> And the local papers ask them to remove your number from their list. And. You call up during regular hours. They have a special department. They'll take your numbers out of their lists. But the Orlando paper they refused to take it off of the lists. And they call every month. <SEP> And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have. Let me ask you about this. Here's something that has been kind of concerning me lately. My fiance received a bill from a Lord and Taylor company. They're a department store. <SEP> She received a bill from them that she had visited some sto-. And I think it was there in Florida. Maybe it was in Miami. That she had visited a store there. And they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise. And the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving. <SEP> And apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number. And I've heard recently that this is a common occurrence where people are using s-. They use Joe Blow's social security number and can potentially ruin someone's credit. <SEP> If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address and their mother's maiden name you can basically become that person. <SEP> If the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to. And since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove that it wasn't her. If it was some coming into the store and stuff then whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of document. <SEP> And wh-. The signature. They should be able to provide you a copy with that signature. And if they can't provide a signature they'll have to eat the charge. Y-. But if the pers- has her social security number I'd be real concerned that she's not blacklist on Telecredit or something? <SEP> Because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there. She probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle. We got it cleared up eventually. What happened.
