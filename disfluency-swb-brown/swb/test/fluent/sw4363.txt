What's your. Are you into the Cowboys? <SEP> I'm not. I haven't been. I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a Cowboys' man. I like Philadelphia Eagles. <SEP> That's all right. That's my favorite team. So. <SEP> Now that Randall's coming back next season I hope they'll do a little bit better. They didn't do too bad last season. But I hope they can do better. How about yourself? I don't know. I kind of go back and forth depending on who's really hot and who's not. I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects. <SEP> But I guess if I have my druthers I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks. Tha-. I kind of like them. <SEP> That's another one of my favorites. They're kind of. They're not my favorite totally. But I do like them. I like. Yo-. <SEP> Seahawks are good. They. Now that Steve Largent is gone I kind of lose a little bit for them. But he. To be honest with you I probably watch college a little bit more than I do pro. <SEP>. I kind of like college actually. Quite a bit. <SEP> That's kind of strange. It's too much running for me in college football. I like the pros. Is it? They do. It's more high tech. More players are apt to act a little bit different when it's a job and not just. That could be. <SEP> When you're getting paid millions to do it I think they take it to another level. But I can see it's more grunted out run the ball type. College football is a little bit different. But. You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then. <SEP> Who's that? Notre Dame? I root for Nebraska quite a bit. <SEP> Nebraska. There's a running team. Ye-. That's boring for me. I'll take the passing teams any day. <SEP> But. I can see definitely how you get into that. To be honest with you I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well. And. It's four yards three yards eight yards tackle. <SEP> It gets kind of monotonous. After awhile I prefer a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just to juice it up a little bit. But. I think they're starting to realize that. A lot of the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore. <SEP> It's high dollar. It's all money now. Even college is all can we get on T V. So. <SEP> That's. So what's d-. This World League is coming in? That's getting ready to start up? Have you followed that very much. Or. <SEP> Not really. I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L. I think it's an institution. It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball. I just. <SEP> It can take over part of it. But it's never going to be the next. It can take over a small market share. But nothing really. It's going to take a little bit. Some people are going to watch it. But it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything. <SEP> It's never going to reach that standard. But. I think I agree with you. It's kind of interesting to see their claim of world football. But when in reality it's really Americans playing somewhere else. It's kind of strange. I guess we're the only ones who take it that far. <SEP> Everybody else still nuts over soccer. But. Actually I kind of like soccer. I've never really played it. But I like the idea. It's an interesting game to watch. That and rugby. I like to watch rugby every now and then. <SEP> Or Australian rules football. That's. Whatever you want to call it there. <SEP> That's some brutal stuff there. That's worse than football as far as violence I think. Those guys kill each other out there. Rugby is something else. There's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere. That's just wild. That's why it's a big college thing. <SEP> Rugby is definitely big in college. Because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do. Tha-. So. I could see the feel for that. But it's fun to play. <SEP> I'll give it that. It is fun to play. If you don't value your very much. You've played it then? But I don't think rugby will ever be professional. But it's. I doubt it. Not in this country anyway. <SEP> You can't stay healthy and do that. That's a rough game. It is. <SEP> But I don't know. I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this year. So you. The Seahawks are an up and down kind of team. They really are. <SEP> It's kind of odd. My roommate that I live with here he's lived in Pennock Minnesota. Do you know where that is? I don't. To tell you the truth I'm. It's a small town. It's about two hours. It's in central Minnesota. It's a couple of hours west of Minneapolis. <SEP> But. To tell you the truth I'm not even really from here. You just live there now. I'm up here for a year on an internship. <SEP> He's. But I actually live in Florida. Live in Florida. <SEP> Like the Seahawks. Who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay? I've only been to Philadelphia twice. <SEP> And I still like. I guess I could go for Miami. But I don't know. <SEP> But. I'm from. I root for Nebraska. So I don't have a real love for Miami anyway. But I don't know. I guess I get into pretty much.
