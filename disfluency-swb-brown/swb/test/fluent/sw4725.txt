Regarding taxes. I. Taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society. But really people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself. And so as a result it's a trade-off for the common good. For the benefit of others. How much of your resource should you dedicate to making things work for others? Have you ever thought just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it? <SEP> I know it's a lot that I feel just like you said that there's just so much that you can do yourself. That you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for. But they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either. But yet they accept it. The thing of it is if I wanted to just permanently become a book reader I guess I could just go on public assistance look for people to take care of me. <SEP> Like so many people do. And probably a good woman. <SEP> Just con somebody to take care of me. And then you don't have to be on the tax roll. But taxes are very difficult kind of thing. And everybody really hates it. It was very timely. I always over pay my deductions. So I wind up getting money back from my withholding. <SEP> That's always a smile. But of course I've paid it in. And I should calculate it better. <SEP> You are you in business for yourself? I work for the F B I. <SEP> So I'm a federal employee. Guess I don't sound like it? <SEP> I th-. I think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else. Unless you work for Internal Revenue. I belong. I've got all four feet in the trough being a federal employee. <SEP> But I can understand who gets benefits. Every time there is a bond issue I vote no on every one of them. <SEP> I. But. This is not tax revolt country. There's too many. Most of us have all four feet in the trough. Plus our snout right up to our ears. So it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a tax revolt situation. <SEP> But the local taxes here. In this particular area I think I pay about thirty-five hundred for taxes on my four bedroom house. Which is a lot of money. And so as people get older and older they think about retirement and that sort of thing. <SEP> And they're building old people's homes at tax expense. I think the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper. At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes. I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a house for that? That's right. Instead it's the taxes here. So. <SEP> Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not or Seguin or someplace like that. <SEP> But there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer. And I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer. If you're not going to use them then you want to be in environment. That's a strategy that the people have to take. Is how to be able to lessen their cost of living. I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire. And I'm saying I really can't stay here as a retiree. After you retire. It's too expensive. <SEP> I'm going to have go out in East Fork someplace. And do my thing. <SEP> My parents are in the same situation. Their home is paid for. But still their taxes are so high that my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes. And they have no children in school or anything now. They don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards. They redecorated in nineteen seventy-five. And they're not doing it again. <SEP> So. It's certainly. You must be a T I employee. You must be what? You must be a T I employee? <SEP> I'm not. You're not a T I. Who do you work for? I don't work. I'm a student. I go to school. I'm in nursing school. You're.
