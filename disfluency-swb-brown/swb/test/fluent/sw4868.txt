Budgeting activity in our household is kind of an informal kind of situation. We put. Actually what happens is my check gets automatically deposited. I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore. It just gets deposited. And my wife looks at all those bills that come in. And all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. And so our budgeting. We really don't have a formal budgeting situation. Every time I've ever tried one I've just got wrapped in my inertia. And I've just decided not to pursue it. What's your budget situation? <SEP> Actually I've had a couple of different situations. My current one has been the most successful. At a certain point in life. An- my ex-husband was an alcoholic. And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies. And that left me with three teenagers. Actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it? It certainly is. <SEP> But at any rate what happened was that I just absolutely put away all the credit cards. I didn't rip them up. I didn't send them back. Nothing. I just put them away. Because there was one that it was really handy to have. If I absolutely had to have something I could go use it. But mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had. And if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it. But then as things improved. Once I got them all through college it came to the point where. My parents came through the depression. I'm not sure how old you are. My parents too. You were born in the late thirties or early forties. <SEP> But my. Late thirties. <SEP> And my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house. And that's kind of the way I was raised. And so I'm not a very demanding person in that aspect. For quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money. Now meanwhile I had a building bank balance. And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there. And not ever have to spend any money on interest. <SEP> That's good. And that's the way I've operated ever since then. It. And if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it. We buy what. We just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher. <SEP> And we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars. And. <SEP>. We got a monster bill coming in. But we also have zero interest being paid. And we pay it off as it goes. And that's the way I do my credit cards now. So we never really get that much over extended. <SEP> I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards. But it's the fact that I have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full. We're doing that. We have. This is our big. We did redecorating. Two new pieces in the family room and new carpet. We've just been spending spending spending. <SEP> I'm envious. I. But we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year. <SEP> We don't have that. It's time for you to do these things then? It's about time that we did that. But the terrible part about it. I've looked at it all. And it all looks still pretty good to me. Why we need to replace it? <SEP> But unfortunately my wife really feels as though it's just been an inappropriate thing to. That rug is thirteen years old. Why not replace it. I say it might go for another thirteen. But too late we'll never find that out. This is so funny. That's wonderful. But you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it. And. <SEP> Certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not. I don't spend that much money. We just sort of have had too many obligations to. We sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school. And that was the major decade of expenses. So we feel as. But as far as any formal budgeting we just apparently have been very fortunate. When we want to go out to eat we go out to eat. We never really have to program money for that or make choices. But we don't have that uproarious a lifestyle. After all we're.
