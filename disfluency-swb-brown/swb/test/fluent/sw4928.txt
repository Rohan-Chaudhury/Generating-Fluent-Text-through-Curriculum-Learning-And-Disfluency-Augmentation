My exercise program consists of. It's a opportunity to stay alive really. Instead of trying to exist on the good health of my youth. I'm. And what I like to do is I like to stretch out. And I like to run m-. I like to run get my heartbeat up. I like to run about two and a half miles. And then I like to work out on the Bailey Life Cycle machines up here at the Holiday Spa. And I think that. I've had a regiment now for about ten fifteen years of doing that. And I kind of think it's a lot of work. But I think it's a lot of work. But I think it's the amount of effort that's required to stay healthy. I have a sedentary job. And unless you do something like that you're going to get sick. <SEP> I need to get. I'm pretty bad about that. I'm lazy. I should I know. I always say that I need to start running. And I'm going to try and do that this summer. Because I never have time. I always put it off. By the time I get back from classes it's late at night. And I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever. Because I'm getting a gut here. I got to get back into shape. Two years ago I started having trouble with my knee. And I've got. I figured it'll go away. I've had to reduce my program. And I've gained fifteen pounds. And so it's e-. I need to get back into swimming instead of running. If I can't run I should be able to swim. I'm such a terrible swimmer. And I really feel I can dedicate about an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort. But if it gets longer than that I start not doing anything. <SEP> So I got a real problem in that regard. It. Do. You obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it. I do it I guess. I'm going to do it because I want to get in shape. It's not something I really enjoy all that much that I'll probably. Once I get into it and if I get into better shape then it won't be as much of a chore to me. It's always a chore. I started doing this when I was about thirty-five. <SEP>. And now I'm fifty-five. <SEP> And I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense. Some health related thing is going to blow me away. That's the same way. I got too much weight on right now. I need to lose fifty pounds. I need to lose at least twenty. But it's just I'm busy. I'm doing a lot of traveling. And it creates a problem when you're on the road. What other programs other than running? Have you ever done anything at all? <SEP> I have. Sit-ups. Or also last summer I was doing Nautilus. Or last year I belong to a club right here. Got kind of expensive to renew. They wanted another fifty dollars. That was a little bit too much money. But doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that. What club are you with? <SEP> I'm sorry? What club were you with? It's called. City Sports downtown Washington. So you're downtown. <SEP> I go to George Washington University. You're down there on twentieth and eighteenth and F G. <SEP> It's Plaza. I'd. There's a Holiday Spa down there on K street. Something like that. But I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria. And that's pretty good. But evening time it gets pretty busy. But generally I can get in and get a program. But I need to rededicate myself to doing this. And I got a problem ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it. I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years. <SEP> And I know it's going to bite me in the ass. And so I really don't want to back off on it. It's something. I think I'm young. I should get started getting into shape. I don't want to. I want. At one point it's going to be too late to do it. When you're young you can abuse all your systems. <SEP> And you can recover. When you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away. And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye. <SEP> And so the object.
