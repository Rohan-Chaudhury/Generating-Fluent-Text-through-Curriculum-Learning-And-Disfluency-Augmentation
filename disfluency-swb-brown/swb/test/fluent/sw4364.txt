Do your privacy being invaded at any time? One of the things that I found to be an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the credit card bill. That is something that is not required. Yo-. <SEP> And in fact it is actually prohibited. But it doesn't stop many people from doing it. And it's one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic research. And to get your phone number on lists for phone solicitations. That you can still I've always done that. I started. Once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse. And I say what are you going to do. You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine. <SEP> I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all. And then ultimately they say no. You don't have to put it down. But really it's part of this compliance thing. The thing I don't like. I know that certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles. <SEP> That really burns me because you're required. You have to do that. And nowhere does it asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone. <SEP> And I think that it's one thing to voluntarily give it because someone asks. You can always refuse. But it's another thing where it's required by law. And then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. That. I don't think they have the right to do that. <SEP> I agree with you there. That's something that people have seen. Here's an easy way to make some money. But I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not. I've heard fairly recently some talk about that in my state. The budget problems up here are pretty tense. And people are looking for alternate ways of. Enhancing revenue is the phrase they use. And they were talking about selling the D M V lists. And there was a lot of consternation about that. And the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea. But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made public that you don't know about. <SEP> That's easy. Whenever you donate money to someone? You become put on something like a sucker list. And you start getting millions of calls or solicitations. <SEP> And then y-. It kind of makes you feel from doing it again. Like National Public Radio or any of the public stations. <SEP> I think I sent in money once to public T V. And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine. <SEP> I. It's like. And it just started soon after I had done that one. And I just said this is terrible. And that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college. <SEP> And it's one thing. They don't sell the list. But the thing that makes me mad is then they start getting other people. The people do these phonathons. And they call you up. And they actually happen to be people who graduated in your class or something like that. And they say we know you. You had contributed x amount last year. Can you do better this year? And hold on here. <SEP> How do you know that? How do you know that? Why you even telling me this? Is it any of your business? It's one thing that I and the college knows that. That's just our business. There's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all. <SEP> Just. And that was very offensive too. I. And so. Last year the Lotus Development Company the company that puts out One Two Three was planning on marketing a C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria. <SEP>
