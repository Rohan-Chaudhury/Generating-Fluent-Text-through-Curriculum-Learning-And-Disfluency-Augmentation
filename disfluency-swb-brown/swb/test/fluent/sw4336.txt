I'm not sure how it is in Georgia. But in Pittsburgh the crime rate really is not very high at the moment. Is that true for Atlanta? Atlanta is kind of high. It's lower than it has been in the past. I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off. And usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher. I. That's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere. <SEP> What kind of crime problem do you usually run into? Any specifics? From what's on the news there are very few actual robberies reported of residences. What's more likely to occur is knocking over a small store or a car theft things of that nature. Very few assaults. Although on the college campuses there are cases of people getting from an automated teller and somebody trying to device a scam for getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners. But mostly petty things and nothing really too big. <SEP> I guess here we run into that sometime. But I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins. There are some but not very high. As far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either. There were one case where this one guy was taking women from the teller and making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all. <SEP> So that's kind of like a double assault there. A strange case that happened about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine. It was a free standing machine. And they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it. <SEP>. There's a crime for you. <SEP> There's a crime. But I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty innocuous. Although from what I hear in the news. And I saw an episode of the T V show COPS one time that was in Pittsburgh. And it did surprise me because they were doing drug arrests and things like that. But I don't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what's reported in the news at least it's not all that common. <SEP> I don't know. Crime situations here they. Like I say lot of cases is usually just apartments and break ins and things like that. And a lot of it is due to drugs. Drug related in most cases. It's not like it's someone do steal a or television or V C R or something like that. It is for drugs because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se. You going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it. <SEP> So you really not making a sizeable profit. So it's not really lucrative to take chances like that even though it does exist. I live in an apartment. Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh. And the apartment would be very easy for just about anyone to break in. But even so it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to lock the doors when they go out and things like that. <SEP>. It would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in. <SEP> There's a T V and a V C R. And they could get in pretty easy and especially since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open while they're upstairs playing music. It could still happen then. <SEP> That's true. But you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not participating in any type crime. I guess there was one case. I was surprised. So happened this person worked at the same place. I work for Georgia Tech. And they work at the same place I did. But I didn't know that they had been watching me. Because I was getting ready to go in my car one morning. And the first thing they said is you don't have to be to work at eight. Shock.
