I try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair. Actually that is really a sore spot with me. I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving. But ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal. And not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal. <SEP> And it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea. But I. <SEP> So do you have a car? Do you have a car? At that time actually I had a Volkswagen Rabbit. <SEP> And it was a real lemon. Subsequently I got a Buick Century. And it wasn't as bad. But last year I bought a Honda Accord. And I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance. And that is it. And it's wonderful. <SEP> We used to have a Honda Accord. And they're good. They're really good cars. Every time I get taken to an auto repair place every time I go I get taken. Bad. Woman goes in. And they go we got a sucker. Let's see how much money we can get out of her. <SEP> That's what happens every time. So. What do you have? <SEP> I have a Pontiac Six Thousand. All the more reason to have a Honda. But our Honda just got old and just wore out. It was eleven years old. And it just out of it. So. So you bought a Pontiac? <SEP> My ex-husband's. This just happened a couple of weeks ago. He's my ex-husband. But just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car. And everything is wrong with it. The power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks. Thi-. How old is the car? Eighty-seven. <SEP> And he just doesn't take care of things. But I was awarded the car. So. There is a man in my church that is a mechanic. And I can trust him. So he is trying to get things fixed on it. But it's just leak leak leak everywhere. But I hate to go into a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not and charge me twice as much. The last time I took it into a repair shop. The man told me I needed a master cylinder. So I said okay. And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars. And then about a month later a man was looking at my car. And he asked me. Not a repair man but just a friend. And I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on. And he looked at. And he said that's not a new master cylinder. <SEP> And I didn't even know what one was. And he showed it to me. And it was old rusty just awful. It was no more new than nothing. So apparently it was the same one that was on there. More than likely. Probably filled the brake fluid up. And that was it. <SEP> That was it probably. It was ve-. I was so irritated. And that's happened to me more than once or twice. Just about every time I've went in somewhere. So what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service. And you can hardly find one. <SEP> The guy that's doing most of my car now goes to my church. And that's the only reason I go to him because I know him. And I know he will tell me the truth. Because he doesn't even charge me for doing it. So he's not going to take me. <SEP> I just pay for the parts. And he does it so. That's wonderful. You're lucky. <SEP> I am. So I don't know. I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all. We took our Honda to the Honda dealership. And they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car. And so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars. They told us we just had to have one. And we bought one. We didn't no more need no new engine. Give me break. <SEP> So it was not good. And.
