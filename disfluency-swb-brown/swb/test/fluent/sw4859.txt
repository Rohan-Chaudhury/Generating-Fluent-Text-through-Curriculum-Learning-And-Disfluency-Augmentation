. Generally I get most of my news in the weekly magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. With occasional smatterings of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and of course the local paper. But my only complaint is I really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper exhaust the details. So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. <SEP> Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article. And so I like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of what's going on. <SEP> But many times the local news kind of suffers. But here I am cheek by jowl with our nation's capital. And. That's right. You're very close actually. It's almost a bedroom community for the capital. <SEP>. When the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself guys I'm inside the beltway. <SEP> But it turns out that the C N N is great. And for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events. But generally they're more sound bitish kind of thing. And I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient dose of news that way. <SEP> A lot of my information comes from several sources. Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio. Which I like. <SEP> I think it's fairly objective. And I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative. And while there's an inherent filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of favoring the other side. That's potential indication of balance. And generally I really do believe they are pretty balanced. I also read TIME magazine. And we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the articles and the front section. And. The MERCURY and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really can stand up there. <SEP> You st-. Did you use to live around here? Redwood City. I use to work at Anteks. <SEP>. I know exactly where that is. Anteks Amdahl and places like that. We get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper. <SEP> A-. The newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times the LOS ANGELES TIMES. Which I've found to be a very good quality newspaper. And I like a lot of the articles there. The other thing when you said we don't have cable T V but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is called C SPAN. I enjoy. We have both C SPANS here. But really on the public T V MACNEIL LEHRER is an hour's program that I always. <SEP> Both? If I watch any news program it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. And occasionally C SPAN. <SEP> I saw the tapes that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust. The whole thing was run on that. And also they have the PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD. I never say that. That would have been interesting. It. <SEP> I think that's always fascinating. I wish we had something. When it first tuned in on that I. It's one that's. I think it was somebody was just ripping the hell out of another person. And I. And everybody was making noise in the background. And then. <SEP> But it's usually the Prime Minister? Here's this dude in a wig. Thatcher. Major. And I said to myself it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about. <SEP> And then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench. And I said it's Parliament. Which could be another of Monty Python. So I thought to myself I can't wait. I'm going over to Britain in mid-May. I'm going to approach my. This is how I discovered the Prime Minister's question and answer period. P-. <SEP> I have seen that. And aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in American politics which I really enjoy. I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions I think. And it's unlike the fairly controlled press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they always seem.
