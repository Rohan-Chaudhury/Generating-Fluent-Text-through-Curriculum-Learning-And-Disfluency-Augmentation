You want to go first? You can start. One of the things they talked about was what do we think about a judge making the decision? <SEP> And I really don't agree with that. I think that the trial by jury is better having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time. You know what I mean? <SEP> This topic is kind of mute. There's no way. We couldn't survive in a trial system without a jury. <SEP> One man one woman can never be objectionable in every case. That's it. Every person has their opinions. And that's why jury selection is often very difficult. I feel the other thing too. They were saying what new ways could it change the system. I really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal. <SEP> If you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught point blank in the crime. There's no question. It's beyond a reasonable doubt. All these things. We've gone through this over and over again. <SEP> They shouldn't allow an appeal. And it can go on for ten twenty years. <SEP> I think this is a little ridiculous. <SEP> I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers. That's right. I work for a law firm. I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining. <SEP> If someone is ill. Plea bargaining is a different story. <SEP> Plea bargaining is something completely different. That actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up. I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think all of the whole criminal system is messed up in that regard. People who commit crimes that they. I don't know how it works exactly. But they get lesser sentences. And I understand that the jails are full of people and that they have to do something. <SEP> But I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it. You know what I'm saying? That a lot of states don't have capital punishment. <SEP> And I think they should. We do. And I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people. And all. <SEP> They're caught dead to rights. I just think that they've taken a life. And they should pay for it with their life. When you're saying as far as the appeal procedure was concerned. <SEP> We just have the case. I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry. His last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up. <SEP> So his appeal was denied. And two days later he got out of jail. For cocaine possession. It. <SEP> But that was absurd. There was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence. I know that. And I don't know. What would you do to change it? To make it better? <SEP> The only I wa-. The appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd. There's no way that could work. I don't agree with that at all. But. Imagine the guilt that person would have. Burned out. <SEP> There's no possible way that you could feel good about yourself. <SEP> If you had to do something like that day after day. No one would want the job. Not really. <SEP> And like I said everyone has their opinions about every case. Do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights. I feel that everyone is entitled to a trial by jury. That right s-. Supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you. <SEP> Were there witnesses? In other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were. <SEP> That you can't remove the jury regardless of the case. You could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place. <SEP> And there's still mitigating circumstances. I.
