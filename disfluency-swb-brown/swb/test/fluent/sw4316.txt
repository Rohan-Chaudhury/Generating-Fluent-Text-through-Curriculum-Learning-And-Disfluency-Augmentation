Do you think that there's any way that. Or do you think there's too much crime now? I guess any crime is too much. But It's out of control. <SEP> Out of control I don't know. I guess it could be worse. We've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood. I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington. There's a lot of problems. There's a big rise in homelessness and more street people. And we get cars on our block regularly gone through rifled through and stuff. <SEP> I would not have guessed that in Seattle. You figured it was like Omaha? <SEP> You know. It's not Newark. But. It's got problems. I wonder what really is the answer. It seems like the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system. <SEP> I think most people regard it as a warehouse. Where you put away the people that are so bad that you don't want them out in circulation. But the problem is that we only have but so much room. And we try to put aside in the warehouse. And all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes. <SEP> And. That's what I hear. So it's. <SEP> I think. Don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea? I get the feeling that a lot of people have. I'm not convinced that I have. My mom taught English as a second language. And she was dealing mostly with people that were in on drug crimes. And. <SEP> You mean she taught in a prison? In a maximum security prison down in central Virginia. <SEP> I see. And the problem she had was not with the inmates at all. The people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison. <SEP> It was. The bureaucracy. They put her. Obviously I didn't see the classroom and hopefully never will. But they put her at the end of a hallway. <SEP> There were no other classes going on at the time. And they refused to let her wear a body alarm. Which. And. I don't know exactly what that is. But I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and really annoy a lot of people. <SEP> But. So she didn't feel safe. She didn't. She didn't. She felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates. And then later on the administration kept getting worse. And she got a couple of inmates that she didn't feel quite as comfortable around. <SEP> But when we came back to the States she decided that it was too. She didn't feel that public schools were safe. So next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison. But. <SEP> At least it's maximum security. But the point was that it. You said that perhaps people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible. And I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people that run the system have given up on it. I think the people that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical. <SEP> I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff. And it's. You can get pretty hardened I'm sure. But getting. I always have problems because I can never decide whether or not I'm supposed to be a conservative or a liberal. But. But I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that a lot of this is circumstances. <SEP> Those are funny labels. I can't help but wonder if I grew up without a father on the streets and with little or no money wouldn't I be in prison at this point? <SEP> I think you can blame it on social problems. I don't know. <SEP> As poverty has gotten worse as education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's been more crime. We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program. There's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse. <SEP> And. It's a mess. I don't remember the gentleman's name. But the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar. And what he. Is he the guy wants to deregulate heroin or something? What he wants to do is take all the money that he gets for drug enforcement and use it for drug education. <SEP> And basically just attack the problem at the demand side. Stop trying to attack supply which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't. Switzerland tried the grand experiment. And they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park. And.
