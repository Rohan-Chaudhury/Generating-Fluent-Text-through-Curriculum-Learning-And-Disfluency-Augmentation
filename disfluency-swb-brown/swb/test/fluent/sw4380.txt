Recently graduated from high school. Meaning three or four years ago. I'm a senior in college now. And I can't really talk too much about the problems with public education in detail because the school system I went to was really superb even though it was a public school system. <SEP>. I feel that my. I'm a junior in college now. And I go to Tech Georgia Tech? <SEP> And I. I got a friend who goes there by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward. <SEP> I've. The high school I went to was a good one also. And I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. Because the one I went to was a lot nicer than a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta. It's more or less a suburban school system? <SEP>. That was true for mine too. Although I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity. But I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. I know that in my town most of the parents they're valued education. <SEP> What d-. And so the students were to some extent motivated to learn. That's true. <SEP> And I'm also. In those places where the economy is really bad they might be more tempted to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would in areas where they. That's true. But I think even more than that even if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read. Which it sounds like. <SEP>. That's true. I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because they have these sort of mandatory tests you have to take before you get a diploma. <SEP> But certainly before that there were people that would graduate from high school and could barely read. And that's just sort of inexcusable. And you can't really. I just can't even picture how that could happen. Except maybe to someone who's really badly learning disabled or something. <SEP> But these people obviously weren't. That's hard for me to say since I didn't really grow. <SEP> When I went to elementary school it wasn't in a great area. But I started learning to read when I was in kindergarten. So I guess I can't say what it would be like to grow up in a really oppressed region. <SEP> I guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people. And I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably. <SEP> I think people just. So I guess the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn. And. And again I don't. They got to know how qualified. I think it'd be interesting to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Sort of maybe from elementary through high school. Just sort of to get a feel for what it's like. <SEP>. <SEP> I think that'd be an interesting experience. But I haven't done that. I can't say that I have either. <SEP> But. But I do think that public education in general can work. And I think it's a good thing. I've heard statistics and things that compare a public education to a private education. Within the same income groups. <SEP> If you compare the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that did send their kids to private schools. I think they compare fairly well. I honestly don't really think I could have done much better than I did in the school system I was in. <SEP> My schools there. I have a lot of. Once I got into high school they had a lot of accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that. <SEP> That makes a big difference. Cause I wondered when they're taking classes with people that are interested in the subject and stuff like that. And in the. Once you start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels. I guess in junior high it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of instruction in the major subjects. Which. <SEP> Actually I think that works pretty well. And that makes.
