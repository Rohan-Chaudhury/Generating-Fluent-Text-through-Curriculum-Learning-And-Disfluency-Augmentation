. I guess you're probably in the same situation we're in. We're kind of past having to provide child care. Our kids are grown up. We don't have any grandchildren yet. But they're. How old are your children? <SEP> One's twenty-six. And the other is twenty-one. So they're getting there. They're going to be getting there. <SEP> There's no prospects right away for anything to happen. I see. <SEP> But. I have five children. I have a eighteen year old son. The rest of my girls are twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine. And I have three granddaughters right now. <SEP> And I. One's in Iowa. And she's a teacher. And what she does is she teaches at a preschool. <SEP> And so she kind of. And they let her bring her little daughter in for free. <SEP> So. But she just works part-time. Then I have another daughter in Bountiful Utah. And she has to work full-time. And it's just tearing her apart. She has a private baby-sitter. <SEP> And the baby just screams. The baby is seventeen months. And she just screams. Even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there. They're not even there yet. <SEP>. It's hard. We. And then I have a seven month old granddaughter. And her mother stays home. And they live with us. As Orange County is really expensive. <SEP>. They live with us. And so of course we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time. But she just. She used to work in the preschool and child care. And she says after working in there. And here she was a provider. But there's only so much one person can do. <SEP> She said it's so awful. She said she'll never put her child in a preschool. I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere. <SEP> But it's really very difficult. And. What did you do when your kids were growing up? Were you. When. The first ten or twelve years I stayed home. <SEP> And then after that I went to work. And a couple of times I just. Then I had one job. And then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job. And then later I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter. Supposed to be good recommended person from the church. And I knew her personally. She had two kids of her own and everything. But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child. <SEP> First of all her children were sick all the time. So when my son stayed over there he got sick. He got sick. Same thing that her kids had? <SEP> And so we didn't take her over there until about eleven o'clock. Then she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten. But s-. That day I was saying he's sick. And she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have. That's what he got. Goes. So it's not like he's going to infect her kids. But then what happened is I said he just threw up. And kindergarten starts at eleven thirty. So she said she'll keep him home. And he'll probably just sleep anyway. You know what. That woman sent him to kindergarten. She sent him to kindergarten. As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him. And he threw up again. And they put him in the nurse's office. <SEP> Guess so. And then what happened is they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter. Called her. And they said that he's sick. She wasn't home. All her kids were sick. But she wasn't home. And her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick. Why didn't she keep him home with her? She didn't do that. So it got to the point where he's supposed to get out of kindergarten about two thirty. And I had to leave work. It was five o'clock in the evening. And I found out he was still there at school. And they were calling me. And they said somebody's got to pick him up. And I kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives two blocks away from the school. I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. And he had a hundred and four fever. They couldn't give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything. <SEP> I was so furious. I quit that job. And I stayed home for awhile longer. Then I went and got a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better. A little more flexibility. You can come and go. But I haven't had any really very good experience with child care. <SEP> When our kids were small we had a couple of good women who would often get them to come to the house.
