Before the one will take. Let's see. I guess I can start. We're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing. Are you really? So I'm looking at something larger than what we have. We've got an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and an eighty-nine Horizon. So I'm looking for something bigger. <SEP> Which are both kind of small. We were thinking mini van for a while. And we're looking at some just four door five passenger sedans as well. <SEP> Are you looking for an American car. Or you open to buying foreign cars? I don't really have a preference either way. It. I guess the American cars had a bad reputation. But I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had. <SEP>. <SEP> Personally I have a Japanese car right now. And I really like it a lot. I think the Japanese really build good cars. And I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole buy American keep American auto workers working right now. But I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our car manufacturers have for a while. <SEP> If I were to buy another car I would be partial to buying another Japanese car. But I would also look at American cars. But when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also. And I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product. Even if it's just details it seems like they. So if I were. <SEP> I j-. There's a door seal that doesn't quite seal. And you have to take it back every once in a while. It's clearly just a design problem there. It is. I'm kind of. Right now. The next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car. I would really like to have a sports car. I don't have a family. So I don't need a mini van or such to haul people around in. <SEP> So I'm looking for more a two passenger car that. Like a Miata or something like that? I like the Miata. But I don't like it enough to buy it. I would buy something. Actually the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car. <SEP> But something along that lines. Interesting. Because I have an economy car right now which is okay. But I think I'd like to move on to something a little better. <SEP> That's interesting. I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for size and safety and then mileage. Probably. <SEP> That's. When I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage. And I was looking for dependability and something that was going to last a long time. For the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was worth that money. <SEP> I think in terms of computer terminology I look at price performance and things like that. And then a little bit at life expectancy. But it depends on what you pay initially. <SEP> But I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger. That's right. Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage. <SEP> And she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton. It's. We had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles. But the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it. <SEP> But. <SEP> I've had one or two American cars I think. And they were okay. I had a Pontiac once. And I never had a problem with it. But my mother had a Dodge at one point. And I had driven it a few times. And I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from. <SEP> Actually I had a Dodge Omni at one point. And that was what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality car. <SEP> I guess you'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car. That's interesting. But. It's hard to beat some of the. I guess in particular we're looking at a ninety-one Corsica buy back at a G M sponsored auction. But I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after they've used it for six months and put twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it. <SEP> And you can get those for eight thousand bucks if you. <SEP> Which is a good deal. Because I guess. Ninety-twos granted but the new ones. Fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot. <SEP> So all the depreciation has been taken off. And the dealer comes out okay. That. I don't know what kind of hit they take on it. But sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it. But I don't know. <SEP> I'm sure they did. We keep looking at that mini van. It's just. We can get a Caravan at twelve five. <SEP> But that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now. But it's interesting. But I don't know. If it seems to be.
