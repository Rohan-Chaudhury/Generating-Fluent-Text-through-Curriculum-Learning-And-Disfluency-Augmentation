. Do you all have a budget? We do. We've been married for twenty-three years. <SEP> And we have three teenage daughters. And they're very expensive. So we have somewhat of a system. It's kind of hard to explain. We've actually gone just recently to having two checking accounts. We always had just one. <SEP> And now we are having two. It's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal. It's. So I have to be. That's kind of the way I feel about it. <SEP> I usually. My wife handles a lot of the day to day finances. And of course we're like a lot of people. We just scramble through month to month. And. Do you have a two income family or one income? <SEP> We have a two income family. She also works. <SEP> But she enjoys it. And she's good at it. If it's. I'm pretty bad about procrastinating. And one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe. <SEP> You know how that goes. But if she handles it pretty well. She writes all the checks once a month. Your wife. It. That. What. Is her career related to finance or accounting? <SEP> Sort of on a peripheral. She's an annuity administrator. And so she works for an insurance company. <SEP> But she enjoys it. She likes keeping track of all that stuff. And. So that's sort of related to her field a little bit. Sort of. <SEP> And we've experimented with budgets from time to time. But if. You have to keep up with them. So a lot of times we just kind of play it by ear. We try to keep our retirement and our savings kind of automated. So we never see that money. Just taken directly. It's just taking it out. <SEP>. We do the same thing. And that's kind of handy. Because if you don't see it you don't miss it. If. <SEP> You don't spend it. You have something to take it out. That's exactly what we've always done. They've always had where they match your funds. Sometimes if you save so much then they will match it. <SEP> We've done that too. But my husband works for an insurance company. And he has now for about ten years. But he was with another company before that. But we have. I work also. But I only have a part time job. <SEP> And I get paid very little. But I try to use that money for food mo-. Jim gives me a certain amount money. We just transfer it into my account. And then I use that for food household expenses. And then I add my own check to that. And then with that I try and handle some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that. <SEP> But the expenses that we need and have around the house. It sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do. <SEP> Just kind of play it by ear but keep the deductions. We. <SEP> Jim has a budget. I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down. I am given so much money a month. So I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that. <SEP> So I try not to. I don't ask for more. I just try and make it on that. Because I think when you go to the grocery store you can go crazy with all the choices that you have. <SEP>. And you can really waste a lot of money that way. <SEP> How long have you been married? About five years. So you're just really getting started. <SEP> So do you have a family too? I've got one little girl. She's nineteen months. <SEP> She's not. She hasn't effected your budget yet really. Not really. Not too bad. Not like she will later on. <SEP> You will see that all of a sudden you're trying to decide whether you are going to do soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do. When. <SEP> And then you really have to start saying now what can we afford. What can we do here. And then you have to really sit down and plan some more. But I think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget. <SEP> And then as the girls got older I think we did more and more of that. More budgeting as they got older. But what do you do? Do you. <SEP> I'm an electronic technician. I work for a university. Georgia Tech research. <SEP> And. So I just. We have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta. I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things. I'd better get back to the subject. <SEP> But budgeting. I found I feel a lot better. We use to work out of one check book. And it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month. <SEP> Now I know exactly what I'm spending. And it's so much easier.
