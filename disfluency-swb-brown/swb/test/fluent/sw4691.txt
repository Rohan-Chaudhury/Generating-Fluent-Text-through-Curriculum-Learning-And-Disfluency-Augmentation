So. I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been. It. Let's put it this way. We've got the New England Patriots up here. So. <SEP>. They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years. <SEP> Why? Partly due to ownership. Victor Kiam owned the Patriots for a period of a number of years. And he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something. And they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth. And it recently was sold to some other people. So hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and keep the Patriots in the New England area anyways. <SEP> It will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you. I've been to a few games before. <SEP> You're from Texas. So you've got two football teams down there. <SEP> It depends on where you're from in Texas. I live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned. I see. <SEP> That's how it is. There's that type of segregation? It's divided. <SEP> It really is. So we've got our Cowboys here. And I don't think anybody roots differently. But I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno. Do you. <SEP> And he is for the Raiders. L A Raiders. So. Do you follow professional sports at all? <SEP> I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well. But I've been trying more this year. I think I know a little more than I use to. <SEP> I never knew very much at all. So I'm trying. It's a good past time. Particularly football. They say football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field. And supposedly psychologists say that men take out their frustrations by watching football. And they get together with a bunch of guys. And they have a good time and everything. And that's suppose to be some of the male bonding and the male instincts or something about the. <SEP> So I shouldn't even try to do it? It's good in terms of a contest. I think that. I personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport. It has the speed. <SEP> And the hand eye coordination. And it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey. So we. And. That's. We're a big hockey area up here. I bet up here in New England as well as in the Minnesota area. <SEP> But. I don't even think we have that in Texas. What hockey? <SEP> We might. Do we? You probably know. I don't know. There's no hockey. There's no. <SEP> Nobody talks about it. So I don't think we do. There's no professional hockey teams in Texas. And we have a soccer team that comes and goes. We don't even have that very much. So. I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now. <SEP> They have this World Football League. You see we have the N F L that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams. There are those teams that play in National Football League. But now they have what's called the World Football League. And they have all these teams from. There's a team in London. And there's other European teams. <SEP> And there's teams in the United States. And they're playing now during the summer months. And it's really overkill. And there's only so much football you can watch. <SEP> I like to do. I don't like to watch. That's good. I don't like to watch anything. So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff. I think it's an excuse to do nothing. <SEP> And I can see what you're saying about the male bonding. And the guys get together. And that's kind of cool. That's fun. <SEP> But it can get really overdone. Have you ever been to a professional football game? I have. Have you? <SEP> I have. Did you do the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole. Actually. That's what you got to do. We talked our. <SEP> I've done that for college football. You the. The same thing. <SEP> We talked our wives. There's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games. And we talked our wives into going with us one time. And they had a real good time. And it was basically for the social atmosphere. And that's the thing. You go three or four hours before the game. You go set up. We set a table up. We do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more. <SEP> But that whole. It's not so much the contest itself and the game itself. But it's the whole atmosphere of going to a game. I-. <SEP> That you miss sitting home in your parlor with a six pack of beer and some potato chips. That's right. You miss that. <SEP> That's right. And any professional sport I think you miss that. <SEP> The atmosphere of being there. In high school I went to every football game. And I twirled. <SEP> And I didn't. I still don't know that much about football obviously. But I still had a good time. Foot-.
