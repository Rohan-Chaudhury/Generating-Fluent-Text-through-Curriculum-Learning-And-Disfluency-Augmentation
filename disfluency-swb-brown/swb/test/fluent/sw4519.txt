Your turn. I start. We keep a budget to an extent. And we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions. And you need to make sure all your bills are paid. About yourself? I have to say I really don't have a budget. Both my wife and I grew up in families of rather modest means. And our family income at this point is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say. And we're both so frugal that we really don't need a budget. We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing. <SEP> I guess that really is sort of keeping a budget. You stay within your means. We stay within our means. But we don't do it by conscious effort. It just sort of happens automatically. <SEP> Although we just moved to California. And the cost of living here in California is rather pathological. Housing prices are from four to ten times more expensive than they were where I came from in Dallas. <SEP> You moved from Dallas to San Francisco. So that presents a real shock. That is a hugh difference. <SEP> Actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California. But. But you have good sour dough. And it's a beautiful place to live. It's God's country. <SEP> And one way you know that is that only God can afford it. So budget is not a problem for us. At least it hasn't been. It may be at this point. But up until this point it really hasn't been. When I was in undergraduate school a long long time ago I noted that the starting average monthly salary for engineers in my discipline was six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that. <SEP> And I noted at that point that if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever. So I stopped worrying about money. And it. Never have worried about money since then. <SEP> That's a system too. Sometimes it's a bit of a problem because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should. But I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of investments. But. Then again you said you are able to take trips. And you do obviously have enough to live on. So I guess you're indirectly budgeting. Just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal in spending the money. <SEP> So that's a form of budgeting. It's kind of a strange topic for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money. I guess we're both lucky in that regard then. How big is your family? <SEP> We have one on the way. I see. My wife. And then we're having one on the way in September. How. Once you get ten children though you may have. <SEP> I think it's just going to be one. How about yourself? I have two kids. One nine and one thirteen. <SEP> And they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point. Do they budget at all? Do you have them on an allowance? I give them an allowance. And they. I basically give my son ten dollars a week. And I put half of it in the bank. And I give him the other half in cold cash. <SEP> And he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank. But at least it isn't burning a hole in his pocket. If he wants to use it he has to go get it. And that usually.
