How do you feel about it? I don't see any problem with testing for random drugs. I myself almost am in favor of it. I work at Honeywell. And I went through a standard drug testing thing before I was brought on. <SEP> I think that's pretty standard. At least at Honeywell it is. I think it's important to insure the quality and almost the goodness of character. That kind of thing. Where do you work? <SEP> I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon. And I just came from Saint Paul. Interviewing with Three M. <SEP> And they have a policy for testing. If they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start. <SEP> And I guess the only drawback I can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem. <SEP> But i-. And that definitely happens. The drug tests they're accurate. But there's always that margin of error. And that's something to be aware of. Another thing is a lot of times they aren't that accurate. They aren't that sensitive. If you're on a prescription drug of some kind what are they going to do about that. <SEP> I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell. And I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something. I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types. Although the literature they give with you says we do this. And then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for. I don't know. What program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon? <SEP> Electrical engineering. I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida. And this is actually an internship up here. <SEP> But even for interns they do the whole drug testing thing. So. They test you before you start or before you even interview. <SEP> Or. They essentially. I sure don't. They essentially made me the offer and then did the drug testing thing after that. So it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests. And then they essentially give you the offer. And then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that. <SEP> So there's some noise on this end. I'm actually in a mall calling. So. You probably wondered. But. <SEP> What happens if you were to fail? Then do they give you one more chance or two more chances? That's a good question. I believe from what I remember of the literature if you fail they give you one more chance. They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it. But once again those things are not that accurate. So there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail. But wha-. Are you working right now anywhere. Or. <SEP>. I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and just interviewing with companies right now. <SEP> That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening. Was going to Honeywell. A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there. And he's doing an internship with I B M. <SEP> And they basically did the same exact thing. We both got our internships at the same time. And we both had to go through drug testing at the same time. So one of those things where we went through kind of an identical process. But. Do they test you right now at work too? That's one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job. <SEP> I think the unwritten rule is expect it. But they don't do it. So. That's good I guess. I don't know. I have gone to a couple of parties since that time. And while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there smoking a joint or whatever. <SEP> And that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up. But. They don't really do that. So. Is it formal policy that they said they might test?
