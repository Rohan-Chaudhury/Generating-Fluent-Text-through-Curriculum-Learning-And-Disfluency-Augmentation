. I'll let you start I guess. I'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing. And I've got some very definite opinions about it. Which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it. But developed a little more but haven't changed that much. What about you? Are you involved at all? I'm not. My employer does not do that. Although I had an ex-employer that. The previous job I used to have they. A few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test. <SEP> I don't know. My feeling is that when there's immediate threat to life and limb should somebody be under the influence of drugs I'd be willing to support that. For example train engineers. Because there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer. <SEP> He crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana. And I guess air traffic controllers. I wouldn't want them to be on drugs. And airplane pilots. But where it's not necessary in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property I would seriously question it. So. <SEP>. That's mine. It. I go back. To me no matter how much our company claims it's not a constitutional issue. That because this is between a company and an employee it is not a government. It's not. The Constitution doesn't apply. But it seems to me that it still should. Our company's doing it because they're a government contractor. And so some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts. And I'd. So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent? And our company has taken that and gone all the way. First off we don't have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they weren't. So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even. <SEP> And. I-. <SEP> Then. And they. So it's a complete random testing. It's random in the sense that you don't know when. It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested. And I sit at a terminal and write software all day. It certainly has no life threatening capabilities in my job. And. <SEP> And. I agree that there are jobs that are definitely life threatening. And there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper. I-. I agree. There's also the issue of. Out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of. There was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results. Or I shouldn't say high. I mean several percent. <SEP> That I will give credit to our company for in that I think there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs. And essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine or some. It's not quite that simple. But it's fairly simple. Kind of a coarse kind of test. Coarse kind of test. And then there's a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it's called. The chemotography to determine exactly what the things are. Is that done. <SEP> And. Now let me ask you this. At the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any. <SEP> I've been with this company for sixteen years now. So this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this. And. <SEP> And it has. They did that three or four years before they did it with everybody. And at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't know. But on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test.
