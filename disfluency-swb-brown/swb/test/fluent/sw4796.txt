Randall. Do you have any special interest in space flight? Ever since I was a young and used to watch the old Apollo missions going off in classroom T V -s. <SEP> I suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those go off. Very exciting. <SEP> The. I've always wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that. And to meet and to see it actually happen. Of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday. <SEP> But that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately. What do you do now? Computer programmer. <SEP> Unfortunately that can be done from the ground. To bad. Made the wrong career choice to get up into space. <SEP> The. I used to think when I was younger that by this time we'd have lots more stuff in space than we do now. Frustrating at times. <SEP> I don't know what you think about all that. I'm kind of young. I'm only twenty-two. And so I'm not. There's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as with the space shuttle and all. Although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties. Although I have a. I kind of wonder if it were possible to market some form of space technology to make it equitable it might severely help the economy in the respect that there's endless amounts of research to be done. Endless amounts of resources and whatnot. <SEP> It would be great if we could find some way to use that to boost the economy. <SEP> The. I've always felt that one of the long-term solutions would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up. Because that's a singularly renewable resource that doesn't require any particularly nasty environment impact. <SEP> And you can just get as much power as you need up there. It's just a matter of how big you build it. <SEP> And of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing. So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good very very good for everyone in the long run is some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also. So I'm. It seems like there's. So you're talking about positive side effects then. I understand. <SEP>. That makes a lot of sense. The only problem is of course that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there. <SEP> And they want to do the research. And they're all nor-. <SEP> The only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to Mars. Which would produce some useful scientific research and so forth. But the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth. <SEP> It would be being done for the glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of for. We should eventually send people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so. <SEP> We should do it for the return we get for it. And unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened. Least not. <SEP> I would settle for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the. But. The downside of that is after you do one of those people say we did it. <SEP> Now we're done. Now we're done. <SEP> No need to play around with this space stuff anymore. That's what happened with Apollo. But I'd give almost anything to get into space. I think you're right. I would too. I'd. Was it John Denver that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle?
