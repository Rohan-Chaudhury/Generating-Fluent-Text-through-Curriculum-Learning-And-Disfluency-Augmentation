I. Actually in this modern day and age it seems like we have more and more leisure time because we have so many appliances and whatnot. We don't even have to cook dinner anymore. But I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together. <SEP> The kids maybe on the average get something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents. That's what I've heard too. It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it although I think probably the worst thing that's happening in at least the modern world today is television. <SEP> Not so much because it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming. And there's also some poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time. It's so darned easy to turn the thing on. <SEP> I know it. I tell myself sometimes just sit down after work. So I refuse to have one in the house. <SEP> Good for you. Good for you. I talk to a lot of people about that. And I've thought about it myself. And I though about it a lot. But I still haven't done it yet. That's good. I'll tell you. Television sure makes child rearing easy on you. The kids can be a real pest. And turning the T V on is almost like magic. It's like sticking an electrode into their pleasure center. And you don't have to worry about them. <SEP> That's true. I've noticed that. But I don't think it's too good. I don't think so either. So I don't know. I take advantage. I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids. But I take advantage of dinner time. We always eat together. And whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them. <SEP> Do you keep your kids active in sports or anything. Or. I guess our big outlet is music. Our thirteen year old son plays violin. And our nine year old daughter plays cello. <SEP> And when our son started playing violin I took up violin. And when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello. <SEP> So there's plenty of interactive time in practicing. Although neither kid likes to practice. I guess that's not a big surprise. <SEP> Not for kids. But I imagine with infants most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them. Although. I try and read to them. <SEP> And I take them to the park and stuff. And. Reading is so good. I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little. And I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore. <SEP> They get to that stage. But I read. There's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book. Have you ever seen that yet? Sleep book. It's called a sleep book. And you ought to get it. I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized. <SEP> We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books. I think his sleep book is my favorite. <SEP>. I like to do it. And they enjoy reading. I never read a lot growing up. And I never read until a few years ago. I just started picking up books. And so I've found that it's really important to me to get to read. I like to get away in a book? <SEP> And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and. So how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day? <SEP> I probably spend an hour or two. That's great. My wife works at night. So she does Tupperware. So she's gone a lot at nights. And so I spend a lot of time with them. I see. <SEP> How old are your kids again? They're two and one. Two and one. <SEP> So you have your hands full with them. That's for sure.
