. How are you? You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget? I feel like I am from Mars. I'm fifty years old. And I've been divorced for eighteen years. But I've two kids and all. But I've never had a budget. And I don't do any planning. And I don't know. <SEP> I don't have a long-term financial plan. I don't try to control my expenses. But I'm glad you're a stranger. <SEP> That sounds kind of like me. But really I'm curious how other people live. So maybe we should start with you. What do you do? About the same thing. <SEP>. Maybe they're going to arrest us both. I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children. And we live from hand to mouth. We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we due for the next month. <SEP> A couple of times we've tried some things. And they worked. But I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it. The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope. <SEP> And when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area. And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent. <SEP> It was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money. And we did that pretty successfully for about three months. And then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope. And in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do. The. I had a part-time job around fifteen years ago seventy-six. And this was a sort of a career shift at the time. And so I was willing to take a half time job to do that. And I actually did. My bank account would. I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month. But I had miscalculated. I didn't keep a balance. It's one of the problems. <SEP> I never had to in the past. I always kept plenty of money in my checking account. But when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money I sometimes would just. Things would get to tight. And sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet. And every time I spent money cash mostly I would write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning. <SEP>. But I would forget to write the things down. And I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data. I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever. <SEP> I even find now with the automatic tellers I'll go take money out of that. And then I forget to take that out of my checking account. <SEP> And. So I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there. <SEP> And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make. The. I have to say that. Let's see at this point on I don't run out of money. And it. And I don't. Someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have. And I think my strategy if I may is to not spend money. I don't have expensive tastes. I don't go out. I buy a car. The last car I got rid of I'd had. It was nineteen years old. People were embarrassed for me. It was a good car. And. <SEP> But it was still running. It was great. My mechanics loved it because it was a sixty-five Buick. And it just wouldn't stop. And it. I just didn't feel the need for a new car. It isn't like I couldn't afford one. And now I don't. I tend to eat expensive food. I don't mind buying a good steak. But for me I only do that every week or maybe once a month. <SEP> You buy a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous twelve dollars a pound. You buy less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars. To me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that. <SEP> Not very often. But I'm just saying as a single person that's a drop in the bucket. And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up. If you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to. That's right. So that's one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing. <SEP> A lot of.
