What do you think about capital punishment? I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes. Which crimes do you feel that? <SEP> I think first degree murder probably warrants it. Because of. So many times it's so brutal and just recurrent. Selling should also. <SEP> Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever. I originally come from the state that has the death penalty. I come from Florida. <SEP> And they're pretty liberal on it. They tend to fry people left and right. Which. That's. Go ahead. Go ahead. Texas is too. Texas has had forty-six in the past several years. <SEP> So they're pretty hip on it too I guess. They do it by lethal injection at Huntsville. I think Florida still uses electric chair. <SEP> I don't know. In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God. And that's not. I don't think that's right. But on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it. <SEP> I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it. And of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. With Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year. They. That's what's happening here. There is. That's. In fact a big gubernatorial issue is the turnover rates of repeat offenders being let out and doing it again. <SEP>. And it's like that's a big problem. But there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build. <SEP> And it gets to be a big problem. Go ahead. I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't. <SEP> Be a little more. Not being able to put it off for fifteen years. Because a lot of these guys they get in. And they get off for good behavior. And I don't know. Up in Minnesota where I am now they don't have the death penalty. And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system. Because they figure I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something. But then for. If I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten. <SEP>. Just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early. <SEP> But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head. I don't know. I think that may solve a lot of that. <SEP> Maybe not solve it. But I don't know. Maybe. I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient. Kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty. <SEP> What do you do Georgeanne? I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas. What program you in? Audiology. <SEP>. What do you do? I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida. <SEP> I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell. <SEP> But I don't know. It's an interesting issue. Like you say in Texas there's been quite a few. And in Florida in the last few years I think there's been a lot. I can't give you figures. But. I just. This was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California. So I think it. The forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years is what. <SEP> Is that right? They gave a run down that Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then. <SEP> I've heard things about that. I've heard that they don't mess around very much. They don't get repealed as easily as they do. <SEP> The guy in California got thir- twice before he went to the gas chamber. And then they said. You don't have to go. And then they took him back. It just seemed a little inconsistent. That's a lot of repeals. And then you have two. You have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever. <SEP>. I don't know. I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it. I guess. What's the policy now with treason? Do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? I don't think the military doesn't execute anymore. So. <SEP> Or death before the firing squad or whatever. So I think about the only one is rape.
