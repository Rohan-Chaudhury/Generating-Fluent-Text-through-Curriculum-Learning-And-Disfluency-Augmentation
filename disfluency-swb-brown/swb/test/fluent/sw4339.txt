Jonathan you say it's near and dear to your heart. Buying a car is something you're contemplating I take it. Fantasizing about. <SEP> Can't do it right now. Our situation is that we're a two car family. And I have a mini van we bought a few years ago. <SEP> It's got a five year loan. So that's still got a couple years to run. And the car I get to drive is a Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month. So I think about sprucing that up in a couple years if I can. They get. <SEP> What kind of a car do you think you'll buy next? <SEP> Since I just turned forty I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car something real sporty. But realistically with the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. <SEP> Something a little seating room. How about you? I think the next car we get will probably be a. I like Buicks. We have a Buick Century now. It's a nineteen eighty-seven. And whatever I get I want to have air bags both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody rather than have them stoop down to get over. So I think the four door is probably a major requirement. <SEP> And other than that reasonable cost and safety and as much economy as you can get out of a car. I'm not looking for one with a great big engine. Something that will carry it around careful is best way to describe it. Right now we've got a V six. And that seems to be just fine. I know they're coming out with some V eight now. And I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age. <SEP> I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back. So they've got some pretty powerful sixes. And V eights seem to be a return to the days of ten or twelve miles a gallon. I drive a Ford truck. I like trucks because they're spacious. And it's handy to haul things. It's not related to my business. I just really use it basically for transportation. But there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that. And it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one. <SEP> Is traction much of an issue for you up there. Traction? <SEP> Not really. It's a two wheel drive truck. And I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway. Actually pretty good way of looking at it. We had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago. <SEP> A case where there was a sort of freak ice storm. And we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car. And this is a rear wheel drive model. So we got some monster studded snow tires after that. Haven't had any problems since. What make is the mini van? <SEP> It's a Mazda. Mazda. I see. And we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and driveability. Fuel economy isn't great being a mini van. But it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others. And it's got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around. <SEP> So we've been able to do some real creative load hauling when called upon. One of my sons has a Plymouth van or that same type of thing the Voyager. <SEP> And they have a child that's five years old. And it's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff. And of course as he gets friends I'm sure that will be even handier. So I know if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value. I think that we're going to be owning a mini van for some years to come. Probably till the kids are out of high school anyway. What about all wheel drive? Is that something that you'd be interested in. Or is that. <SEP> I'd be satisfied with a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra. And even as light as that is with the small tires it's done pretty well in winter. <SEP> Again like you if conditions are that bad I probably don't want to be driving anyway. So I know I'd be happy with a reasonable four door. Again we've got the same issue with getting kids into the.
