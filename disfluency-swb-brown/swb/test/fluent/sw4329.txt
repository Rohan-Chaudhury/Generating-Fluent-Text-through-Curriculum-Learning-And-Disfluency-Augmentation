I guess it starts recording now. I don't really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in. We live in the Saginaw area. <SEP> Saginaw? And I'm not real familiar with anything that. I. Fact as far as I know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. Or the grocery store or anything in this area. <SEP> The rec-. We live in Plano. And they started off recycling by putting the. I think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now. I guess the city has bought the big green trash cans. And they have a recycling truck that comes around now. And you separate your glass and paper and aluminum. And you set it out. And they pick it up. And it works real neat. They seem to be having a real good response. <SEP> That is pretty good. We're originally from another state. And I know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing. The city set separate trash cans. And you separated your stuff. And you put it in there. And they took it. On bottles did they give you so many cents back for cans. I don't really know. <SEP> Even or. I don't really know. They started after we moved down here. And so I'm not really familiar. I just know that my in-laws up in Oklahoma that's how they pick it up. But I don't know if they get anything back on it. Or do you get money for it? <SEP> I noticed it. Iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can. So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles. <SEP> All kinds of bottles they really charge people when you purchase them and then when you turn them back in. <SEP> I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel. And now most of them are throwaway. <SEP> So maybe that's one thing they can do. I think now they're a lot more expensive than that. I bought some Cokes the other day in the little bottles. And I know they were at least ten cents apiece. I started to see at home. I was how much were those bottles? <SEP> And they come in eight and ten packs instead of six packs. And it was two dollars and something for the bottles. I was God Almighty. It costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes. <SEP> That was my brother's first job in a grocery store. He was in the bottle area. In the bot-. It's pretty dangerous out there when they fall over. But it's quite. <SEP> They say that there's a big glut of the green glass. Of green glass. <SEP> It's amazing. Out in this area they really don't have anything. I know that Minyard's and places like that around Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have four different bins out front. Different colors for different things and things like that. <SEP> But I do know some of these places were doing that. And they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them. <SEP> It's. I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs. It's. People just. They really don't. There's too much labor involved to separate the stuff. More than it's worth. <SEP> It's. I don't know. It can be. It's not as easy selecting clean junk as they say. Who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away. <SEP> That's right. That's right. It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. We all do it. <SEP> It was nice talking to you. It was nice talking to you. I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything. I think two or three minutes is fine. I-. <SEP> Is that it? It was nice talking to you. And I guess actually I was going to do it for my son so that he could make some money. <SEP> But then it has my name on it. So I'm okay. I'll sit down here and call it. We're doing it for a church choir. So. Are you? <SEP> That's interesting. That's nice. <SEP> Thank you. Thank you.
