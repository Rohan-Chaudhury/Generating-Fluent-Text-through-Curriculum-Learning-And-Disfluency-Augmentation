Steve with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them. Or what do you think? That's a really hard question. I do know that politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths. I. Let's example. Our friend the President right now says no new taxes. We should be cutting taxes now because of the recession. And at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases. So I know the politicians aren't straightforward. In terms of economics I'm not. It's hard to call. It really is. I never really thought that the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little. I always that the real question is are we getting a reasonable return on investment. For instance like Social Security tax or Soc-. That's tax. We're paying money. And supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us. <SEP> So that's. When I see that money taken out of my paycheck or every other week I really think that money's history. And as far as return investment that's nothing. And we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back. Someone was telling me that there's still an office staffed with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio which. I may be wrong. But I believe that the cure for polio is already founded. But supposedly once you have an office in D C and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down. And they just haven't yet. <SEP> I'm not exactly sure about polio in particular. I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio. I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. That might be the difference. I don't know. The other thing that I remember seeing on T V lately had to do with. It's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically. <SEP> For some reason historical sites with the full federal money and everything seem to appear almost as political favors to very strong politicians. It's funny because it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where Congress is able to attach all kinds of funny amendments for individual congressional districts to the main budget proposals. <SEP> And the poor President has to either accept or reject the whole thing. It sounds like you think that we'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto. <SEP> I think the line item veto is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the President uses it to get rid of this kind of waste. On the other hand it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. And just to get rid of the unimportant things. And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to where the boundary between waste and necessity is. <SEP> So I'm not sure that that will help solve our problems. But there definitely is a problem with. I forgot. There's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something. Pork barrel politics. <SEP> Pork barrel politics. There has to be some way to do it. I know state governors usually have line item vetos. And I lived in Massachusetts for a while. And when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. But Massachusetts when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially. D-. At least at the end. I don't know. I. <SEP> They were very good at first. They were in very good financials at first. And that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well. And then of course the bottom fell out. It's tough. There's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations. I guess you can raise taxes and then create job programs and whatnot. Or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot. And spare the economy. It's a hard balance. It definitely is. Even not for government even just for a small business. I know some.
