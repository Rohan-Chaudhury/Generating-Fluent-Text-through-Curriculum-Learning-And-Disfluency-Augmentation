Your turn. I don't think they should abolish it. I think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got. But not for petty theft? <SEP>. For major things like premeditated murder. Mass murders. That type of thing. I don't think it should just be used loosely. It should be used as a deterrent do you think? Or should it be used. To prevent further crime? <SEP> To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street. By some technicality. And they go down the line ten years. And then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. <SEP> And that's about the only thing. For theft and stuff like that or manslaughter. I don't think they should do that. There's this old Jewish saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I guess if it was someone in my family I'd probably feel that way. <SEP> I've never had anybody in my immediate family murdered. And so I really wouldn't know. But I feel like if I did I probably would feel that way. One of the things I was thinking about is from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value. So if you have someone that destroys that value then you want to take steps to minimize the loss. Of course you have to also put value on the criminal. <SEP> So if you terminate him that's a loss of value. That's true. So if you weight everyone equally then you have to say the likelihood of not terminating him. If you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person. In other words you'd have to murder more than one other person in order to justify taking his life. <SEP> Besides him. Another way you could do it is weight this value by the value to society of the people. Which is pretty delicate thing to do. But one way of doing it is by income. So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then he's obviously not worth very much. <SEP> His life isn't worth very much then. And so the likelihood that maybe expected murders by him is integrated over the income of the people that he murders is maybe a loss of eight hundred thousand dollars. But if integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him. Of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's easier to terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less. Which means <SEP> I suppose you could say that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation. Potential. That's the key right there. Potential. <SEP> Are they rehabilitative or not. That's all fine and well and good philosophical. But if you're involved yourself personally. I know I have a friend whose son was murdered on the night before his sixteenth birthday. And let me tell you I knew them personally not intimately but quite well. And you're talking about real trauma. Trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies. <SEP> I can imagine. The father. Of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get in terms of psychological impact. And. <SEP> Was he murdered? Did they find who killed him? They found him. And he is on trial for capital murder. So it hasn't been a long time ago. Just recently. Actually. He was convicted. And of course now you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process. But. <SEP> That appeals process it's what just drags out and out and out. My brother-in-law here in Texas my sister's husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy actually in Houston. And he.
