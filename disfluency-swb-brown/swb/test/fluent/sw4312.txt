What kind of music you into? I have a pretty wide taste in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to lot of different forms of music. In fact it's easier for me to say the types of music that I don't like are opera and screaming heavy metal. The opera it's right on track. I like classical. But I can't deal with opera at all. <SEP> And heavy metal it's noisy. I'm into some industrial music that's a bit even harder than that. It's got to have a point to it. <SEP> I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to. But the basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you gets a little annoying. <SEP> What kind of progressive stuff? <SEP> Lot of stuff that actually has ended up becoming popular like Nirvana and. I'm thirty. So lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and the Sex Pistols and R E M that sort of stuff. R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being ultra mainstream at this point. And it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed. It's a lot of people saying that bands in that position sold out. <SEP> I think that's pretty much bull. Because R E M really hasn't changed. If it's interesting. They're producing similar music. And it's good music. <SEP> But people have picked up on it. That's good. <SEP> I think it is. I'm impressed. For a while there popular music seemed to have not a lot of point to it. I was really tired of the Michael Bolton. <SEP> Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes. <SEP> And I could go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money. But he picked the right songs. And that's about all he had going for him. Or still has for that matter. I guess. <SEP> That and a marvelous hairdo. I'm sure that sold a lot for him. That's all you really need for a lot of pop. I've kind of developed a short hatred for pop. <SEP> It just seems like there's no real point. You hear the same tune over and over again in a thousand guises. And. <SEP> It's interesting because you were saying that you liked classical music. And I like a lot of classical music. But I also dislike some classical music. And what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time. <SEP> I can believe that. What kind of things do you like in classical? What's the standard? <SEP> Stuff that I like. I like Bach. I tolerate Vivaldi. I can't stand Debussy. <SEP> I like Tchaikovsky. He can make a lot of noise when he's so inclined. And some stuff that I like. For instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition. <SEP> And that's interesting music. But it would not get performed by any municipally funded philharmonic just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive. <SEP> We're much better off playing Beethoven's ninth. That's right. We'll do the ninth. And everyone will know it and hum it. It's safe. <SEP> And it just isn't chance taking enough for me. I feel that music should take chances in one way or another and that if you've heard a piece a hundred times.
