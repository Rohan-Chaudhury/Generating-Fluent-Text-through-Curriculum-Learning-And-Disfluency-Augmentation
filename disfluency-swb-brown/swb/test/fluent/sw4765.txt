A lot of companies now are using drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users. And I know the government gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government. <SEP> And I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it. I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian. And I feel that if you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background. Of course we're. Being involved in my organization we have deep background checks. But sometimes drug use can escape that. <SEP> And I have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to figure out who has a drug problem and putting that guy into therapy whatever it is to break this activity. <SEP> Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs. And there isn't anything. But getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope. What's your feeling? <SEP> I guess I'm probably a little more toward the other direction. I guess mainly because I. There's two sides to it I guess. One is that if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever even if it's smoking inhibits your ability to function then I think that I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual on the spot. But I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business. And I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go. We had prohibition for awhile. And then we didn't have prohibition. We've had laws against various other forms of drugs for the last sixty or seventy years. <SEP> Maybe a little longer. I think the first morphine laws were nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that. Eighty years or so. <SEP> So I. It's hard for me to justify what seems like basically a breach of the freedom from search and seizure on something that may or may not stand as a law fifty years from now or even twenty or ten. Who knows. The thing of it is that is in many respects just an over simplification. Prohibition certainly didn't last. I think there's so much criminal activity that people go into to support drug habits. <SEP> But you got to look at prohibition though. You had the same problems there? They support drug habits with things like burglary or prostitution or stuff like that. It goes back to that again. If you look at prohibition. Because it's illegal it costs more. If it was legal. Face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for ten or twenty dollars an ounce. I must admit that. <SEP> And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap. And you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it. But. Get. I must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society. <SEP> That's why there's people dealing it because there's money in it. There's ridiculous amounts of money. But I think that being in law enforcement I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it. But I really feel as though the interdiction effort is. As soon as you get rid of one goon that's involved in drugs and tha-. <SEP> Interdiction's hopeless. And then another one will jump up. There's no way you're ever going to win that. But we see. <SEP> The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is. That's a losing fight. As soon as we wind up for. If we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand. But people want to get stoned. And I don't see that. <SEP> It goes back to what can society impose on people. Can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen? I don't think you can. I was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic. So I'm one of these ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people. <SEP> So. I can really relate to. Everybody ought to do their own share. I don't have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff. But.
