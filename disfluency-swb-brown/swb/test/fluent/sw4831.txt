When you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times the benefits are good. And the pay is regular. But sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on. And I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know what's going on. And maybe that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do. What's your feeling about benefits? What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company. Since I'm kind of on the older side I just feel like when I start talking about benefits I'm concerned about medical benefits. My husband works for McDonald Douglas. And so his medical benefits are so excellent. That's really great. <SEP> I work for a bank Western Financial. And they don't let me know really about anything that's going on. Even some of the immediate things that I need to know I don't know it until the next hour. And all of a sudden we know we've got changes made. We're changing departments. We're changing policies. We're changing doing other kinds of things. Which to me is disturbing. I feel like if I don't necessarily need to be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level. You are right there. I'm pretty much on a low level as far as the company is concerned. But I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening. And I think I can be a better and more effective employee if I had a little bit more information along that line. Th-. I work for the government. <SEP> And actually I work for the F B I. And so there's lots of things that we don't get told. For good reason. But basically there's lots of things that we should know about projects. I'm an engineer. <SEP> I'm a COTR. And sometim-. And I worked in the same lab with a guy. And we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years. And we should have. We're now collaborating. And. <SEP> And it. For two years we didn't. Which was kind of stupid. But our organization is doing something else on Monday. For all unclassified programs we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways. And all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do. Which I thought was kind of interesting but that sort of thing. That is interesting. <SEP> But I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on. But of course most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know. And if you don't really count. If you're not part of the program you might not get told for months. Or you might if it doesn't impact you directly. Or if your management doesn't think that. But regard to benefits. Most big organizations have decent benefits like retirement and that sort of thing. In the private sector I would think that one of the major situations especially when you reach the mid-fifties is keeping a job until you retire. <SEP> A-. And engineers are baggage as they get older to most companies. And it's very much like the military. It windows out. You think I'm getting more money. And I'm getting more responsibility. I'm doing this. But as you climb up that tree pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree. And pretty soon somebody falls off. I've fallen off twice in the private sector. <SEP> And I can get up. I know. It seems to be kind of scary. Because you think of. My son's eighteen right now. And he wants to go into engineering. And the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open. And he's interested in basically three different areas. But it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that. He needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years. <SEP> And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical. My brother-in-law he's sixty. He's not ready to retire. But his company is closing up. And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff. And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on. He's getting cut back. And he's not ready to retire. He may be retired.
