So what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products? Not too bad really. I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I really didn't want it. But I got it anyway. And it was a Braun. And they were real good about taking it back. It wasn't a problem at all. So I was able to get that back pretty easily. <SEP> But I don't know. I really haven't returned a whole lot lately. Have you? I haven't had to. It's the. Every so often I'm almost pushing it myself. Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's. And it shrinks too much. And say I should have known better. I bought it from G I Joe's. And it was probably made in China by slaves. <SEP> But they. Most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway I get pretty good stuff. I think that aside from the fact all markets being internationalized. <SEP> And if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find. It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S. <SEP> I was reading. I was reading something in CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact. They were talking about cars. And about how you'd like to buy an American car maybe. <SEP> But the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever. I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger. And I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi. <SEP> So it's what are you going to do? But that's the way it is. I don't know. I personally feel that if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them that's the way it goes. And more than manufacturers should get a clue. And they should start making quality products. I think they're beginning to. The days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away. And. <SEP> That's what I thought too until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue. They've got all the cars rated. And essentially I don't see much of a trend. Just every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there. There's nothing wrong with them. And the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars. But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy. And they're pieces of junk. I know. Still at it. <SEP> That's eighty-six through ninety-one. But I don't know. Maybe they're getting better. Maybe they're starting to get a clue. They got a three year lead time. It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so. <SEP> That's just it. Technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until quite a few years down the road. But. The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer. Because technology is so volatile and changing all the time. And can you think of any other industry where in software they. <SEP> If the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail s-. Or maybe I say you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade. <SEP> It. They keep up with it pretty quickly. And that's a real good thing I guess. <SEP> I don't know. And the hardware all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity. And the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along. <SEP> They're kind of the leaders right now. I used to see all those commercials for Windows. And you're they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name. Why don't they just say almost a Mac for half the price. <SEP>. They'd sell more if they were honest. Almost is the key word there too because I've used both. And I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all. It's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. Base. <SEP> That's true too. <SEP> But I don't know. I've gotten a little bit out of the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home. I do use a Mac at work. But I really don't do much with it at home. But. Apple's sort of making a s-. And they're ones were. Growling consumer need to worry about the Mac they're getting. If you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back. They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive. <SEP>. You sound like you must work in the computer business. I have one. I do desktop publishing at work. And I have a machine at home. And I belong to the user's group. And I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out. <SEP>. But technically I'm not actually in the industry. I don't work a computer company. I'm an abuser. <SEP> That's all right. But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to keep up with the changes as they happen. That's true. <SEP> Something that I find uncomfortable is you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer. And you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for. Let's take the example the modem for. What baud rate do you get? It used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-.
