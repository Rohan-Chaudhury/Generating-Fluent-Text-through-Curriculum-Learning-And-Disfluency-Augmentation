With regard to jury trials. I really feel as though whatever system has been used historically is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is based on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it. What do you think? <SEP> I don't think so. Possibly in the jury selection would be the only. Just for example what we're seeing in California I guess. It makes you wonder had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome. And the problems that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating. Just makes you wonder whether or not they. Won't. Maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that. But then the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently. <SEP> And the other two guys sat in the car. That's bad. <SEP> And they didn't get beat up. It. Rodney got beat up because he involved himself in some self-destructive behavior. <SEP> And just like the burning and looting is self-destruct. Everybody says this is the nineties. <SEP> And they're going to rebuild. And it'll be even better. What do you think. Some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area? That's right. With everybody with that mind set. That whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto. <SEP> They're only going to suffer. And you might even be able to use it for a bombing test site. They're only going to suffer. They've defeated themselves with their looting and violence. I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the tape. And. Everybody is saying this is going to be a new era. And we're going to reexamine this thing. The average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed. They're a bunch of animals. How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything. Forty deaths. There are forty people that are dead as a result of that. <SEP> I know. It's really ridiculous. And I'm just trying to determine how you weigh Rodney getting the hell beat out of him against forty deaths. <SEP> Against forty other people being. And there's no other. I'm not exactly sure what the circumstances surrounding the deaths. And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and pursued it because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing. Those deaths. <SEP> Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner? I. No tears. Or just an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what. But I suspect a number of them. <SEP> You see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot in the street. <SEP> Or beaten. And my reaction is I would have run over fifty people rather than stop. And there would have been just nothing but carnage after if I'd been at the wheel. No one would have stopped me. <SEP> That's exactly how I feel too. They wouldn't have stopped my car for anything had I seen them coming. But I was just wondering since you're back east and a little closer to the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here. I'm inside the beltway. <SEP> You know how they always say inside the beltway they think thus. And I say wait a minute. I'm inside the beltway. And I don't think like that. I'm a government employee. <SEP> In what section of the government do you work? I'm with the F B I. That's interesting. And the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick who's another government employee wanted segments of my speech that were done a year ago. <SEP> <SEP> And he wanted another collection a year later. And so this is my seventh call. A year ago I did eleven calls. <SEP> I see. And so that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate.
