. What is your community currently doing with regard to recycling? Basically they're just having various recycling bins located for trash pickup. That's more than we have up here in Massachusetts. Some local communities are very active in that respect. And they do have bins set up. But I live in a metropolitan area. And they're not too inclined to do something as aggressive as that. <SEP> Here they. Live in an apartment complex. And they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins. I think a lot of the issues with regard to recycling are that people have to be motivated to do something like that because it does take extra effort. Whether. And I know Massachusetts has. A bottle bill was passed. And we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now. And the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the store and not. That's the majority of people that I know of anyways. Where people aren't really eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do. And I'm not going to throw a bottle away. It's like throwing a nickel away. That type of thing. <SEP> Here they're trying to push through a bill. But people need to be more conscious of it. And a lot of people are against it. And it's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell sodas and stuff. Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything. It took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. And matter of fact I think it took three tries for it to go through. And it's been pretty successful. And people notice it as far as highways being. People would have a drink of soda. Instead of throwing out the window they keep the bottle. So it's been a ecologically sound policy as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth. But more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into manufacturing. And that's the big thing that they try to promote. <SEP> I think here instead of just requiring that you put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate. That's a good idea. <SEP> There definitely has to be a motivation factor. And I know that where I work. I work for a defense contractor. And there's a big push on for recycling paper materials computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of Styrofoam usage because of the process involved in Styrofoam and the whole eco issue and that. And they're very proactive. And matter of fact they give you discounts if you use china wear rather than Styrofoam stuff. So it's incentives like that that get people more conscious of it. I think that's what they need to do. Be more proactive like that. I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books. Usually have them come from projects to collect old ones. Usually just get dumped out with the trash. And phone books are a large volume of annual trash. They just. Matter of fact that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa-. The local schools you could send your phone book with your kid to school. And what they'll do is they'll recycle it. Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time. A guy went to a landfill dug down five feet and pulled up a phone book from nineteen sixty. Because they don't degrade over such a period of time. <SEP> Part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper. They contain the glue and stuff. And they used to have to take out all the pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them. <SEP> Now I think they've come up with some way of pulling the glue out.
