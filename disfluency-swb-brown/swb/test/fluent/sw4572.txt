So what things do you consider an invasion of privacy? I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. I had a little bit more time to think about it. I was thinking of. I don't know. I started to think about all the big data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those demographics studies that they do that have who knows how much stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere. <SEP> And I don't know. I don't know what they actually have in there. But I know they sell those. <SEP> What about required drug testing as a condition of employment? That was the other one I was thinking of. I think that's. I know drugs are illegal. It thing actually. I have worked at Texas Instruments. <SEP> And they instituted a. Drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees. And actually to tell you the truth I really did not think much about it. I hadn't. It really didn't relate to me. But there were some things that people brought up like what happens if they get a false positive what recourse do you have. <SEP> And also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity. And yet a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they don't admit to it actually a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure. So what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this. Although they don't actually execute it themselves it's really the government that. So in that sense at least philosophically it's really borderline legal. I think that a person's competence should be more determined by their actions and their behavior. And if they're on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them. I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a chemical. <SEP> What about this AIDS epidemic? Where you find that certain people actually are criminal in their disregard for others. These people that are carriers and that don't reveal it? And of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't. <SEP> It destroys their libido. That would be kind of an extreme. <SEP> If they ever. I've heard of things like marking them somehow or something like that or putting them all someplace in a kind of. So what about that as an invasion of privacy? Wel- I guess it kind of borders on what do you value more. The invasion of the person's privacy or the possible danger to other people. <SEP> So. It gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society. I guess that's been the big role of government. Generally. <SEP> It's supposed to have been. That's kind of a difficult one to go into. I mean that particular case. It. Because there's a lot of people that they could require obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because there's a huge part of the population. Not a huge part but a. <SEP> A growing part. The AIDS population that have it that don't know they do are spreading it. But again to require such a test and then to make it is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things. I don't know. I don't know how exactly I feel about that. <SEP> Maybe chop their weenies off.
