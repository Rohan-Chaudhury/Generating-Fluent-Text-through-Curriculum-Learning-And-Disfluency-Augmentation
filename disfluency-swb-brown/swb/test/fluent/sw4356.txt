. Have you heard about Saturns? I've heard some about Saturns. I don't know a lot about them. I haven't been over to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their reliability is rated to be equal to that of the Japanese cars. That's great. Actually that's kind of the type of car that I'm thinking about we might get. Saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a Saturn dealer. This offshoot of G M. <SEP>. And supposedly they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard. <SEP> I've heard a lot of people like them. Yet I don't know whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point. I'm kind of. My card and desires tend to be pretty picky. And so. Like what? Let's see. I like cars that are designed with human beings in mind. <SEP> And that's not just the driver and the passenger. But that's the person who's working on it. Cause I do almost all my own maintenance and those types of things. And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in finding a car anymore that's fairly easy for me to work on it's not very. Almost unlikely at this point. <SEP> And yo-. I've got a sixty-five Mustang. And I do most of the work on that myself. <SEP> And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that I just say I will never do that with the modern cars. It's not worth my time. You can't get in there. You can't do anything. And it's so complicated too. I look at it. And I say boy. I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that. <SEP> I've got an eighty-three Saab. And I find that for everyday things. It's really very easy to work on. And I'm kind of spoiled. I used to have a Chevy. <SEP> With a three fifty in it. And I really liked working on it. Cause it was pretty easy too. It was about a nineteen seventy. So I'm kind of biased in that. And I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore. <SEP> And that's probably one thing I'd look at. I think another thing I'd look at is safety. That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about. Actually one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags. <SEP> That's a real nice car I think. I've driven some Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. As rental cars. <SEP> And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus. It's a really nice car. I think it's a stylish car both inside and out. It's comfortable to drive. Reasonable performance. And this is out in California where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore. I've been real impressed with that. Yo-. And I didn't realize that they were putting dual air bags in that car now. Ninety. Or the ninety-twos. The ninety-twos had dual air bags. <SEP> This newest model. You could get them with duals. I think that That's excellent. <SEP> That's excellent because. But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars. Actually my wife and I are actually contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so. So we're actually been looking around and thinking about things. We'd like to get a. I don't know. What do you call it? A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that. <SEP> Year old ninety-two or something like that. Those are. If we. <SEP> That would be a good deal to go with. And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too. Because they looked really nice. <SEP> What do you looking for in those? What attracts you to the Saturns? Or of course we've already talked. The Taurus is safe. But what kind of things are you looking for? The Saturns you can get air bags in them. I don't think you can get dual side air bags. But one of the two things that I'm really. I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems. <SEP> You set down. You look at consumer reports. We've been pouring over consumer reports. And you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that. Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have. And the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars. <SEP> And the other one are the Saturns. So those two things. And then we kind of want a four door. <SEP>
