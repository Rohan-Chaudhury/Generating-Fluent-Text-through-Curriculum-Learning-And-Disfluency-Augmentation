The question was talking about the juries. And one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having especially for repeat offenders that. Maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again. So that a judge would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed. <SEP> <SEP> I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case. So a judge should have the whole dossier of the criminal there. <SEP> And if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing. I agree with you. One thing I heard was this where instead of going to the regular court they have a mock court. It's supposed to be all legal and everything. You go. And you present your case. The other side presents their case. And you're done with it. It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. But it's not that we have such. It didn't backlog all of the cases that are all ready pending. So I. That was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. <SEP> In other words not. There would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? <SEP> I don't. There's a point on which we don't agree. I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime one of the parties wants one. <SEP> And usually it is the defendant that wants to have the jury hear the case. So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we take that. <SEP> That would require a change in the Bill of Rights I believe. And so. And I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that. Because if I didn't have that right not to have a jury that I would feel that my civil rights had been violated. But I meant for some when both parties agreed that we're going to have a judge here. We're not going to have a jury. Let's get it over with. Sort of car accidents. <SEP> I think that's all ready possible. I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial <SEP> <SEP> So. I agree that that should be encouraged. People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial. But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to clients unless they feel they can tweak a jury into giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the award. Giving a different sentence. <SEP> The take. <SEP> And I suspect it in cases like. I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil. Is that right? We're at liberty to talk and meander as long as it's all on the same theme. <SEP> In the case of civil things maybe the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage. <SEP> And I think that may be where jury use is overdone. There are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently. <SEP>. <SEP> But the lawyers are really. It's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible. <SEP> So. I was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in a criminal cases. <SEP> I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that. But I am in favor of it for criminal cases. So there's a difference of my view there for those two. You can tell I haven't been in too many judges chambers or anything like that. Have you ever had to serve jury duty? N-. I was called once when I was nineteen. <SEP> But I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me. And I was doing school and things like. They let me out. An- I've never had to it since. And that was almost twenty years ago. <SEP> It isn't. Sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in. That would have been about twenty years too. <SEP> Just last year. And the case I heard was a criminal case. And it seemed really trivial. It involved two bicycles. <SEP> We didn't do the sentencing. The judge did. How interesting. <SEP> We rendered a verdict. And then the judge was the one to do the sentencing. And that was here in Wisconsin. So I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it.
