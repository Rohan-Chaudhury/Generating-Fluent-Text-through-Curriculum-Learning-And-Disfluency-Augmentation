We in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to keep track of daily finances. Way back twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer I did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and checkbooks and all this kind of thing. And we kept that going for about a month. And it became so onerous that we gave up on it. That sounds about right. So the only thing that we do now is I keep a little spread sheet of what I call the net worth calculation which is just the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth. And I only update that maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just basically when the statements come in. Just to see whether or not we're getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what. <SEP>. That's really about the extent of the kind of financial score keeping that we're doing. <SEP> It's kind of difficult for me. Because right now like most teachers I'm laid off. And. That's terrible. <SEP> So I spend most. I substitute a lot. So it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances. <SEP> But I know how much I have to bring in a month. And that's about it. That's about as far as we go. And then anything extra is more or less split up between all of us. And just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day. I see. Are you married? Are you living with people that you're sharing expenses? <SEP> I'm a single mother. I have three children. I see. So right now we get aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it. And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support. <SEP> So right now I know what I'm getting from the state. And I have to balance more or less what I get from the state with my bills and try to work as many days as possible. Any time they call me in. But I still have to figure out. If I work too many days then I lose all my state aid. And if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills. And it's like a juggling act every single month. <SEP> This week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in. But they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation. I see. So the four days before they only have a four day week. <SEP> And they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in. A- I see. They don't like to be absent before a vacation. <SEP> But I'm shopping around as far as trying. And getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. My kids are in Boy Scouts. So trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. Because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me. So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit. But we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle-class Americans are in. You're the first. My next door neighbor just lost his job. In one of these. <SEP> His company. Went bankrupt. Actually it was a subsidiary of an outfit called U S Shoe or something. It was a computer subsidiary. I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company. But they just folded it up and told him to. They took the top management and gave them jobs at the corporate front office. <SEP> And everybody else was sent packing. Hang on one second. I've got. <SEP> Somebody was knocking on my door here. It sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present. It sounds terrible to say. But at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be. In terms of keeping score of input and output. <SEP>. Do you have a computer at home. Or. We do. And we try to. <SEP> I keep track of every penny. And more or less enter it in. Every single day I'm at the computer. I see. <SEP> And it's what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet. <SEP> Do you use a standard spread sheet. Or.
