Julie are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with special care for elderly? I don't know. My grandfather is ninety-two years old. <SEP> And he is still living by himself. My grandmother died a couple of years ago. But he doesn't want to move away. He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm. And he recently had to have an operation. But he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home. <SEP> Is he able to still do everything himself pretty well? He was until this operation. He has arthritis. And now I don't really think he's doing that well. And a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him. And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot. <SEP> But my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three. And died six weeks after they put him in the home. <SEP> And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather's feelings. Because I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left. And for a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over. And I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. <SEP> They can look after a lot of things. But there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. I know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home. And they died. But they were all younger than your grandparents. They were in their eighties. That type of thing. But I did I guess. When I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically. But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job. And that's difficult part. Because I think what they often get used as is almost like a very high level or long-term care similar to a hospital. <SEP> I know here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in four levels. And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care. Generally are not able to look after themselves to a very great extent physically. Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease or physical and mental handicaps. Where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. Even though it may be minimal. But I think that it can be helpful in that it gets people the level of physical care they need. But I don't. At least I think some nursing homes do that. But I think a lot of nursing homes really are guilty of neglect. <SEP> And I think it happens more in areas where it's a broad social medical system where there's government medical care and that kind of thing. If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals. And I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding. I think that a majority of the places in the U S there is some government aid available. But the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay. And if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely.
