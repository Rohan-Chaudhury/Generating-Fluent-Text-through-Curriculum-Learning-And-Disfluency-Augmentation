How do you feel about the crime in your city? Is it. Minneapolis isn't too bad. I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders. <SEP> That's kind of gone up in scale and some other things. I personally had a little experience the other day. Somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck. But actually when you look at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it's really quite a bit better. Because I came from Florida. <SEP> And in Orlando crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever. So. What part of California are you from? San Jose California. <SEP> I have a good friend there. Here the real problems are the gangs. A lot of murders just in general the whole. We've only been here a couple of years. Before that we lived in Colorado. But in comparison to Colorado it's real noticeable. <SEP>. I can just sense. I won't go to the grocery store at night. That's. You know. And it's that kind of thing. And. <SEP> That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like. We have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce home theft burglary and things of that sort. Do you have that where you live. Or. <SEP> Interestingly enough right before I moved up here. I'm an intern. And then I go back down in May. But in Orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it. We've been broken into in my apartment about four times in two and a half weeks. <SEP> And one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there. Because they were just. It's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work. <SEP> And then the houses were left unguarded. But. I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it. That's a good way to work it with a neighborhood watch. Also I've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home. Like on the weekends. <SEP> Is that right? A high percentage of free time. I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is spent doing yard work outdoors. So they wait while you're outdoors. They know the house is unlocked. And then they just slip in. Slip in slip out. <SEP> That's amazing. They know exactly what they're going for. So I've heard that's really on the rise as far as a new type of crime. <SEP> It almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter. <SEP> Unfortunately. Unfortunately it's starting to really look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day. <SEP> One of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit. <SEP> And the crime level there of course is quite a bit more pronounced. But. I guess. <SEP> I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis. I'm not real sure. It helps to know your neighbors. They give you. You're supposed to make lists of cars. I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar we have a list. Is that what you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates? Pretty much. <SEP> I was basically involved in that in the organization of it. And then I left right in the middle of it. I'm not sure where we went from there. <SEP> But. That whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious activities like that. <SEP> You hate to be paranoid. But there are really only so many things you can do. You can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program as a woman not go out at night. <SEP> You can do that which is what I choose to do. One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited. <SEP> Even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps. It's against the law to do a lot of things. They could basically. When I was getting robbed down in Florida I was really considering electrifying doors things like that like. That's. <SEP> They did in Miami that time. But it's not. If you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home it's considered self-defense though. <SEP> That's not always true. It isn't? There was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed. <SEP> And essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home. <SEP> The guy came in while he was home. And sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned. He didn't die. But he was severely burned. And he took the guy to court and won a settlement. So that makes you think. <SEP> It's like your hands are very much tied. I think if you had a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's down-.
