What are your benefits like at your job. And how do you feel about them? Pretty good actually. I work for Hewlett Packard. And they have a pretty good benefits package. In fact they're kind of known for having good benefits. The pay isn't fabulous. Although I saw a survey recently. And I'm making actually over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me. That's good. <SEP> What kind of a degree have you got? <SEP> I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering. So. And I'm not a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff. <SEP> Anyway our benefits are pretty good. We've got stock purchase program and a. That's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a pain. But there's a four O one K plan for sheltering some taxable income. <SEP> There's. How long have you been with them? <SEP> I've been with them for seven years. That's good. <SEP> And the best thing is four years or five years you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything. So it's not t-. But there's several medical plans to choose from that cover pretty much everything. I don't get sick that often. So I don't pay much of it. And I pay five dollars every time I visit the hospital. <SEP> They don't cover eyes though. And I have contact lenses. So that's kind of a pain. <SEP> But I can live. But for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered. <SEP> So that you've got small things to gripe about. <SEP> And. That sounds like you must feel really good about it. And the dental plan is fabulous. The dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because. <SEP> I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that. But that's not the case. <SEP> So I guess nothing. It's fabulous. The. What about you? I work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory. I also have a part time job at a law firm. And I get no benefits from them at the part time work although they pay better per hour than my sort of quote real job does. <SEP> And benefits through the government are really. They're not the greatest. Before I got my degree. <SEP> I'm a computer scientist. And before I got my degree I had done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington. <SEP> And at that time I was in gravy city. The law firms in this town. For a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties. And benefits were just amazing. <SEP> And we had everything paid for. And with the government it's not quite that nice a deal. But it's okay. What we have to do is we have to pay about twenty percent of our costs. And it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing. And the plans that are available to us range from kind of mediocre to really sweet. So I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good plan at this point. But it could be better. That's for sure. But there are other things that you get when you work for the government in terms of more relaxed atmosphere. It's really nice for me anyway to be able to work in a research atmosphere where I don't have to worry about academics or anything like that. And so I'm really kind of happy about that end of things. It's. <SEP> One of the things with my company is that they've got a reputation for a lot of job security. And there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do. So there's. I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company. <SEP> And I haven't had to move my residence to do that. I still live in San Jose. And. That's fabulous. It. That's interesting. Because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area. <SEP>. He lives in Andover. <SEP> And the work that he. He's specifically an engineer and does work with the Hewlett Packard machines that do sonographic imagining. And I've been over to see his complex over there. And it's amazing. <SEP> It's all ecologically designed. And he seems really really happy with the set up. And. <SEP> In fact I know a guy who works at Andover who I used to work with out here. And he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position. Kind of interesting. Anyhow.
