. We have. We used to when I was younger. <SEP> We'd go every weekend. But we haven't done whole lot of it lately. I'm kind of into it. I'm kind of a sailor. <SEP> I'm up in Minneapolis now. But I was in Florida. So. I was kind of into it for a while there. Were you sailboating? For the most part. <SEP> I had a little sail. We don't get to do a whole lot of that up here. <SEP> Just motorboat's all we. What part of Texas you from? Nacogdoches. Whereabouts is that? <SEP> That's between Houston and Dallas. It's the oldest town in Texas. Is that right? <SEP> That's pretty wild. We have Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches. So we do a lot of boating on. So you got some lakes around you can do that on. <SEP> You do skiing and stuff. Or. Little bit. <SEP> Just got through snow skiing. <SEP> Just came back from Denver. But. That sounds good. Our. The snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now. It was heavy when we were there though. <SEP> I didn't see any boats there though. Not too many. But. I just got back from a weekend. We went and had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing. It was pretty nice. But I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I did a lot of sailing on and stuff. <SEP> That's a lot of fun. But my parents are pretty big sailors too. They're kind of into it. All we have up here mostly bass boats. I guess fishing's a pretty big thing. <SEP>. Lot of fishing going on up here. So where about in Texas is that? Is that centrally located. Or. <SEP> It's. You ever heard of Lufkin? What major city is nearby? Houston. And that's south or north of there or something? <SEP> Let me see. Houston's north. Dallas is south. That sounds pretty good. Does. I guess the weather. Does that stay pretty constant there. Or. <SEP> It's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons. Probably seventies eighties in the afternoon. That's pretty temperate. That's not too bad. But. Have you done any other boating then. Or. <SEP> I hadn't done any lately. But that's all. I used to have a friend that his daddy owned a boat shop. And when I was in high school we used to go boating every day just about. That's great. I. <SEP> And we had a different boat every day. That's fantastic. I used to kind of be that way myself when I lived in north western Florida in the panhandle. I used to sail about every day. I'd go to work. I'd like to do some sailing. It's a lot of fun. It's. Especially if you get a pretty fast boat. Those catamarans are pretty fast. <SEP> What. You can actually. If you get one like that do have somebody teach you that. Or they just. Actually I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life. My family's pretty into it. <SEP> And I took sailing lessons when I was about six. And then. Is it pretty easy? It's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it. <SEP> So it's not too bad. It's pretty easy to get the hang of I think. And generally everybody I've known has kind of gotten into it. But some people are more motorboaters which is fine. <SEP> That's about all we have. Lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing. But then again they may never have tried anything like catamaran. And that's when you really start getting into speed. Some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers. They get so fast. <SEP> I didn't know that. They get pretty quick. But. That would be something. <SEP> I haven't personally done that. But the races. I work with a guy right now that races catamarans in the summertime. And he's pretty gassed about it. He's got a good. <SEP> What lake do you all use? He's from Detroit. So he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes and does his sailing. For me I go back to Orlando in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast. We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast. And there's a lot of places there you can go. So that's a good thing. <SEP> But so what do you do for a job? I build transformers. <SEP> Is that for T I. Or. It's for Cooper Industries. Are they primarily electronic then? <SEP>. That. <SEP> They have a worldwide. But. All we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that. <SEP> How do you like it down there in Texas? It's real nice. <SEP> Been here all my life. No doubt. I've never been to Texas. I've been to Oklahoma. But that's about as far as. <SEP> Oklahoma's nothing like it. That's good because I didn't like Oklahoma that well.
