I think actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have working for a large corporation. And for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit. I think it's health care. It's what. I think everybody would say that. <SEP> And if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg. Belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you. The. Sometimes I think it's more important than salary. <SEP> Do you also get dental? And I don't know if I would rank that second. But since I have three boys it can turn out to be important. You know. I know. In a given year dental expenses can really kill you. <SEP> My husband is with Northwest Airlines. And he gets the full health and dental. And we have four children. And what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous. And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it. It's. <SEP> Or maybe they don't. And then if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will. That's right. That's right. I guess that would be up there. I'm not sure how I would rank that compared to retirement. Or pretax savings was another thing that I think is a great benefit. <SEP>. And I think it's really something that the government ought to encourage more because there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in Germany and Japan. <SEP> It's a lot easier to save it when you don't get your hands on it first. When you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can offer some incentive. And if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do. <SEP> And. What about lesser benefits perhaps for you but for the women in the corporation. For example. Leave? <SEP> Do they have father leaves or anything like that? I don't think so yet. They may have just plain parental leave which either one can take. <SEP> I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short. I do too. I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks. <SEP> I think it's just a crying shame for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks. And. <SEP> She isn't recovered. And the infant needs her desperately at that point and time. There. <SEP> There ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time. <SEP> I agree. It's so important to families then. And yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up. <SEP> Especially in this day and age. That. You don't want to start over again anywhere. You're right. I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I would most like to see changed. The parental leave. <SEP> I think they've come a long way. At least some companies. Some of them my girlfriend that works for a rental car agency. And as manager they have a very very poor leave policy. And I just don't know how women do it. Particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end. They do it by shortchanging their kids. There's no other way. Unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely. <SEP> That's right. That's exactly right. People moving as much. And it's just a terrible choice. You shouldn't have to make it. <SEP> You're right. And. <SEP> One of the benefits we get of course is travel. Would I like to have that. It's wonderful. <SEP> The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere. But you can't afford to stay once you get there. Listen I have friends in a lot of different cities. If you just fly me there. I'll take care of that. That's right. You have to have an awful lot of fun. Just getting there has to be half the fun. <SEP> And I guess the.
