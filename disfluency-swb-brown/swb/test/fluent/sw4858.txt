I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't. And looking back on it I tend to think it was mostly a mistake. On the other hand the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time. <SEP> But on the whole I think it probably was the wrong thing to do. How about you? I was just in high school when it ended. <SEP> Ended up being. I was in the last lottery. And I was glad it was over by then. <SEP> I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there. Just because we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like. We. Those people that I know. I work with several that were over there. And for some of them it was just kind of not so much a holiday. I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods. And ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles. And then they'd come back. <SEP> And. But that they weren't really allowed to do anything. I. To me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway. It's funny. Tonight I was helping my kid with an essay on Stalin. <SEP> And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war. And actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was almost a personal struggle among these three. I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense. <SEP> They're certainly all leaders. And with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them. And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the people saw the cold war as you had to draw a line and defend it. Otherwise they'd get you someplace else. <SEP> Looking back it seems like that was only partly true. That there might have been a better place to draw the line. I guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end. But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him. And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war. They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward. And we were wrong. <SEP> But I. Like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable. But the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where. And as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing to a completely and winning it whatever that would mean. I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't prepared for. I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war. <SEP> The other wars seemed like a valiant war. They seemed like a valiant thing. You knew who was good. You knew who was bad. <SEP> And it was a traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you know whichever way it is. You're not. But in the Vietnam war it seems like it was. The sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad. And the. It's ambivalent. <SEP> It seems like even the people. Had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and the Laotians. And the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved. But. What about the domestic effects. I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government. And they. That pendulum started to swing maybe even too far. To the point where supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on. <SEP> And that tradition is still. It's dying now. But it's still alive as opposed to. This Desert Storm stuff may have killed it. But I think that was one of the biggest. That the domestic unrest.
