I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale California. This is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota. How you doing? Pretty good. <SEP> I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it. I'm ready whenever you are. <SEP> What are your thoughts on the subject there? I definitely think decisions have to be unanimous. I think that's probably a good thing. It's probably the safest thing. <SEP> It's to easy to get a quorum. And simple majority won't do. And even two-thirds majority it's. <SEP> That's. Quorums are to easy to get. And there's always that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason. <SEP> So it's. Definitely. But I don't know. I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing. Gives them a little too much power. <SEP> Tha-. I know of a couple of people who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently. But. Plus you may be doing a guilty verdict. But it may be for technical reasons. About the only good thing I would say about that is that it would hurry the process up a bit. <SEP> But even now I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that. And that's what the trial by jury. I know. If the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances who's to say. <SEP> It. There would be much more of that. No doubt. Are you involved in the legal system at all? But. I tend to follow it just to know what's going on. <SEP>. I've got some friends that are lawyers. So. I do too. So. <SEP> One of them just got his law degree. But to tell you the truth I'm not real familiar with the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now. I really haven't studied it in depth. I know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases. Which is. <SEP> It's more in how you present it versus who's right. I'm sure of it. Because a lot of those things it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better. <SEP> It's kind of weird. I don't know. I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get. <SEP> I know. It's just. When I was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and. <SEP> You say we can't bring up this point because then they're going to. The opposition will say this this and this and. And it's the stuff that they can twist around is. <SEP> It's pretty amazing. And it's like the truth isn't really important anymore. It's. It's not. And then you get people who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because. <SEP> This friend of mine's pretty obnoxious. And he really gets into suing people. And so he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case. <SEP> It's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. That sounds like a little abuse of our system. But. But. But it's for the more general. People don't want to take responsibility. <SEP> It's. And most of the time they're looking to place blame. And stuff. <SEP> You're from California. Is that right? Originally from Chicago. But. I was just thinking. I wonder how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and where I am in Minneapolis. I really. <SEP> From what I understand it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana. And Louisiana is completely different cause. It's based on common law. And the rest of the country is not or something like that. <SEP> Pretty strange. But fortunately I never have had to go in even for jury duty. I haven't either other than. <SEP> But that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in as a witness. He may subpoena me. So we'll see what happens. But. I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. <SEP> It's. There are too many big problems. There's such a backlog of court cases right now. To try to get them all in in a good time. I know. And we already have too many lawyers as it is. And if it's criminal cases you can't put them in jail because there's no room left. <SEP> That's true. And in fact they're even letting some go. I'm originally from Florida. And it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them. <SEP> That's not a good solution either. Not at all. I'm not real sure what the.
