How do you. It sounds like you've got a television going on there. I can assume that you probably watch the T V news. Is that. I almost never watch T V news. <SEP> I. I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio. What station do you listen to? <SEP> It's a local radio station. It's called K L I F cliff. Cliff I see. It's not affiliated with anything is it. It's not a network station. <SEP> Because I listen to public radio a lot. And they have K C R W which they may be trying to start their own cable TV outlet. They're getting a little feisty now. This station has a lot of just ongoing news. <SEP> And occasionally in the morning I'll pick up something like C N N or that. But I hate watching the ten o'clock news. Or. So you have a paper or something or. We have DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas. <SEP> I read it pretty much from cover to cover. How do you like it? It's been a while since I read the Dallas news. Fact last time I read the Dallas news I was in Arkansas. <SEP> I. The TIMES HERALD went out of business here. <SEP> And so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper. That must be pretty bad. How did that happen anyway? <SEP> Financial trouble. Not how. When did they. When did it happen? <SEP> I guess they closed down about three months ago. <SEP> How do you keep up? I read the TIMES LOS ANGELES TIMES. There's quite a task if you've ever run into one. They're speci-. They're very voluminous. <SEP> They're thick. If there's something you want to know it's in the TIMES and in detail. We used to have two papers here in town. And then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of just nobody was buying it really. <SEP> So there really is only one major L A now? Pretty much. There used to be the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley. And they're not bad as far as a local paper goes. In fact it was kind of weird because I met the editor while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time. It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff. He was a really cool guy. Went to Columbia University and all this stuff. And it's a pretty good paper. But it's not the TIMES. <SEP> Although I'm sorry to see some of their. There's a daily news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're expanding I guess. And occasionally I pick up TIME magazine or something if they've got an interesting lead story. But it's. I don't have time. I used to read TIME magazine a lot. But I don't read it much anymore. That's kind of a problem for them. There's a lot of people who fall into that category. <SEP> And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community. Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. <SEP> I see. The big dailies don't like to step much out of their home turf. I have to admit the TIMES is kind of provincial too. It's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover. <SEP> Now they have started here running a three times a week Plano section. And it's just sort of four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano. But it's still not an awful lot of news. I know. It was a big discovery when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County. <SEP> The way they've been handling it before they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border. I would imagine in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs. And of course they tend to cover the county. And we're not in Dallas county. So they tend to ignore places outside of the county. <SEP> I find that attitude kind of arrogant though. It's you're taking our money. But you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us.
