Are you in the middle of anything? I'm not in the middle of anything. I've just. About the last thing I did. About maybe close to a year ago now I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house. So I guess that. The whole thing? <SEP> That was fairly large undertaking. It's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house. Did the framing and all? We did it all except for the sheetrocking. <SEP> That was the only thing we didn't putting the ceiling up and things like that. We weren't sure how to do that. And. Maybe you and I should get together. Because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing. And I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work. That's the exact opposite. We put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up. We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work. And that's it because you have get those joints to go together. Ye-. <SEP> And whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that. We didn't know a thing about any of that. And so. My wife wishes I hadn't done that. <SEP> It looked very hard to do. So. <SEP> We figured well just. I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional. So we left it to somebody who does it for a living. But. I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Probably so. And we'd never done it. <SEP> So we just left it alone. But that's. I guess I'm only twenty-one. So my vast experience of home owner's knowledge is not very much. So it's just what I have to do more or less around the house for my parents. So. You framed in new square footage. Or was it stuff that was already enclosed? <SEP> It was brand new. Brand new. We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house. So it was. And you knew how to do the framing? <SEP> My dad knew how to do most of it. We'd gotten a couple of books. And then he just started doing it. I don't know. He did all the flooring himself. He put the whole floor in. And then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there. And then we put not necessarily a garage but just a. After we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less. It's not enclosed. It's just somewhere to drive another car to park. And it's. Do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground? <SEP> It's off the ground. On the piers? It's on about twenty-two inch piers something like that. Did. <SEP> You had those poured. Or you did them yourself? <SEP> Those are. We did those ourselves. So. You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete? <SEP> So. It's. The last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of. Those are. I've done one. I helped somebody do one of those before. Those are. You can buy them in kits. But we didn't do that way. But it's. I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job. <SEP> Those are nice. They're pretty forgiving. You can always tear stuff out and redo it. It's a. That's not near like building a house or anything. <SEP> But. Those are nice. Especially when you get done you've got something. I don't know. I like them. You just sit down on the deck and do whatever. Have a barbecue. <SEP> I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and a backrest and all that stuff. Or. I. <SEP> That sounds nice. All done by yourself. I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes. <SEP> Designed. So we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts. And then the rest of it I just did. A contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work. But it was pretty. It was about four or five hundred square feet. The same size as the addition that I just put on. So. <SEP> That's a good size deck. So. That's. It's not that expensive. I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and no less than that. <SEP> That's not. Cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together. That's good. That's not bad at all. Didn't have to. <SEP> The wood may. It got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is. To get good lumber it costs. I don't know about Dallas but even in this little town it's not cheap at all. I was surprised. I'd be surprised if it wasn't cheaper where you are. It's probably more there. It probably comes from where you are. <SEP> It probably does. Most. I'm not sure. But. When I drive through that area that's all I see is pressure treated lumber yards. <SEP> It's nothing but woods down here. <SEP> I haven't. I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington actually. But that was just when I was a kid. So I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore. But I don't know we're a college town. So that doesn't help us out any. East Texas. <SEP> We have. Gas is a dollar twelve a gallon. So that's probably about what you're paying. So. My current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard digging it out and laying sand and putting pavers on top of that. So. <SEP> That's a lot easier. You've got something going all the time.
