. I say they. Probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water. If they sink they're innocent. I see. A good southern solution. <SEP> How do you feel? That's of course being facetious. But. You'd have to say that. <SEP> I don't know. The things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing. And seems to me that I think that's the way it's done now. At least my understanding of the law which isn't very good. <SEP> It seems to me that the judge does it. And I think that's probably all right in that they maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing. <SEP> And I guess also what the system will absorb. <SEP> Probably more tuned in to that. Possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty. I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole. He could have a personal prejudice. Judges are people like everybody else even though they're supposed to be impartial. That's right. <SEP> But maybe. And I think that may be an exception as well. Because I think that. Doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge? I think that's the way it is. <SEP> They decide whether or not the accused or whatever would get the death penalty. Do they have a death penalty in California? In fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month. <SEP> And there's a big uproar going on right now. The Governor has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not. <SEP> It's someone who had killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact. <SEP> I. Something like that I've got no problem with it. I guess the way I think about it it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge. It's just like if you've got a dog that's running wild and biting people. <SEP> Put it to sleep. Just get it out. It's not able to fit in. Something inexpensive. I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just. <SEP> If somebody gets the death penalty they're judged guilty. They got the death penalty. They should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal. And if not don't let them sit up there on death row for fifteen years. I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years. That. But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake. And you'd hate to be one of those. <SEP> I'm sure. The other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which again I think is the way it is now. That all verdicts. <SEP> Maybe not. I don't know. At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous. I believe it is in capital. <SEP> I think in lesser cases it's ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever. How ever many is sitting on a jury. I believe that's the way it is. But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is different than the other eleven. <SEP>. And they've only deliberated four hours or something. <SEP> And they say they're hopelessly deadlocked. And the judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet. <SEP> I'm telling you go one way or the other. That's probably an expensive trial. Six months so far they said. <SEP> Probably. Probably. I'm not sure there's a number. It's probably thirty forty thousand dollars a day worth of all the free for all. Maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote. <SEP> That's been so long I've practically forgot who Noriega was. That has been going on. My cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami. <SEP> So she follows that stuff pretty closely. But. That's interesting. She's not involved in that case. But she does. Have you ever served on a jury? <SEP> I haven't. I never have. My wife has. But I haven't. I got called. But I never got selected for a jury. I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process. <SEP> And they had some guy that was defending himself. <SEP>
