What kind of crime do you think is the most prevalent in our society? Probably robberies people stealing from each other. Such as New York City? <SEP> Is that what happens up there a lot? That's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen. That's the most prevalent crime. The ones that really add up after a while far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs. Everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually. I wonder if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because so many people use it. And even though just using is not really. It is a crime. That is a crime. I guess when you count all the little things that people do like. Speeding is a crime. That's true. <SEP> I break that law every day. But I was staying in the realm of felonies versus misdemeanors and drug use. Actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor. But what kind. Have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything? <SEP> I've been caught with marijuana before. So I guess that was a crime. I got a year's probation for that. But. That's not that much. Those aren't. It wasn't that big a deal. <SEP> I. When I think of crime I think of stuff that affects other people like people getting killed or raped. I think rape is one of the worst crimes. I think it is. In some ways it's almost worse than murder. <SEP> It's very degrading. And. Murder is hard on the people that were related to. <SEP> It is a rather final solution though. Once a person's gone then it's. But the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life. What do you think is an appropriate punishment for things such as rape or murder or something like that. <SEP> For a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is. It's a pretty good thing. I agree with that. <SEP> They have that down here in Florida still. The electric chair. And. I think Virginia does too up here. Do they? I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy. And I guess usually they're always sure they got the right guy. But. I think the appeal process takes too long. <SEP> So do I. I think it from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year. If that. The sooner. A year's plenty of time for something to come out I guess. <SEP> Then there's been guys in jail for six years. And the other guy admits that he did it. And they. It's oops. But. The system isn't perfect. It's run by a bunch of imperfect humans. You do the best you can to make it perfect. You go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect. <SEP> But I think you have to accept some of the errors. I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment for murderers. I don't know if it would or not though. I don't think it's so much of a deterrent as it is a good way for vengeance for the relatives and family members. You know what I mean? And society probably too. <SEP> Just general society to. It kind of gets it off their chest. <SEP> It does. And it decreases the prison population. Which is significant. <SEP> I know that a lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other. <SEP> And they're the kind of crimes of passion and stuff like that. I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead. You might be able to stop people. They're thinking about it. They know they're going to get the chair if they get caught. Generally the crimes of passion and things like that are not premeditated. <SEP> They can be. But usually they aren't. They're spur of the moment. <SEP> That's right. And the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those individuals I think that you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time. <SEP> They could probably do it again. They would have no problems doing it again. That's right. They didn't have any time doing it the first time. And I think locking them up for fifty years doesn't do any good because as a taxpayer I'm going to pay one and a. <SEP> It do-.
