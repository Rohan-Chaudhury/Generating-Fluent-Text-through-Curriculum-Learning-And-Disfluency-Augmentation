We're supposed to talk about recycling. Basically what your personal opinion is on it. This is really for a speech research project they're doing. So I don't know. Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it? They just kicked it off down here in Sarasota county. They did? <SEP> They had been doing it. They started first in Sarasota City. Which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually. <SEP> And they've got these. Not quite. They've got these wh-. It's county wide program now. <SEP> And what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage. Yard trash. Plastic cans and glass. And then paper. <SEP> Which in the paper it's just newspaper and corrugated cardboard. Is the only thing you're supposed to put in there. <SEP> No slicks. That's good. Let me ask you this. Do they require you to presort it? <SEP>. That's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on. In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really tightly. But when I lived in Orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there. And they'd just sort it out for you. <SEP>. It was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am. So. I talked to this girl. She's an acquaintance of mine. And she's involved with. What is the name of that company. It's not Amway. But it's the other big vitamin company? Shaklee. <SEP> And she's just Shaklee crazy because it's her business and everything. And she asked. We were talking one day. And she asked me a couple of questions. What she said that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they don't want it to change their lifestyle and especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything. <SEP> That's what recycling at home sorting does. It's a little extra work. <SEP> And it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do here in Sarasota county is they've got. It can. You put your garbage in a garbage bag. And you set it out by the curb. <SEP> If you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container. Or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb. You got to tie them up and everything. The plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub. And it's about a foot and a half deep. And it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long. <SEP> This is a little container. And then they have another one the same size. That one's red. Then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods. <SEP> And so you would have to rinse out your pop cans. Otherwise you got bees and ants. And if you've got food containers or anything like that it's a big problem. It is a big hassle. <SEP> So not only do you. That's true. Up here they give you one of those containers. And you put everything in it. <SEP> So it's like if you use a lot of stuff you. It's like if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place. <SEP> This is true. So it's kind of a pain in the butt. This is true. But I don't know. That's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just. You have those garbage people that make twenty thirty bucks an hour. Have them do a little bit of the sorting. And maybe come up with a better system. <SEP> Make it a little more convenient. But. They've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here. If you want to have a nice garbage can. <SEP> And it's on wheels. And it's big. You can actually rent those? That's interesting. <SEP> Up here the city provides them. Kind of like. I think in the city they do. But out here in the county you have to rent them. <SEP> And they just add it on to your water bill or something. So where exactly are you in terms of Sarasota? Are you north of Sarasota or East. East of Sarasota. <SEP> And Sarasota is on the west coast? South of Tampa? <SEP>. I'm. About an hour south of Tampa. That's. <SEP>. I listen to this talk radio station down here. And it's really. They. I don't if you ever listen to talk radio. But those guys they just kind of get into stewing up trouble. With the callers and things like that. Occasionally. <SEP> But they get into some really good conversations sometimes. And some of it sometimes it's serious. And they have some good feedback and all that stuff. And from listening to that I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with. <SEP> And this kind of fits into the aid program. The welfare program that's going on right now. And it's.
