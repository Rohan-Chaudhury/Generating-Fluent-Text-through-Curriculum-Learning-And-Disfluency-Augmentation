Think about this? Do you have children in school? I do. <SEP> I have two that are now just about ready to graduate from college. But I also have two that are just entering school. I think they're just pushing them entirely to fast. So you see a big difference then in before and now do you. <SEP> Or. A lot of testing? <SEP> It seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade. My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock. <SEP> And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner. I do too. I think that's awful. And I have a preschooler. I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten. And I thought how mature do you have to be. I know. What's the new criteria. <SEP> And there is a. Do you have the standardized testing now? We have all kinds of testing. And it's over and over. It's I T B S and just everything. And they test test test. I live in Plano actually. And I don't know if you've heard of Plano. But it's a very transient community. <SEP> A lot of people from everywhere. It's just north of Dallas. And it's grown in leaps and bounds. We must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now. <SEP> And most of them from other places. J C Penney's come down from New York and of course T I and Xerox from Rochester. And we just have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in. <SEP> <SEP> And it's a very wealthy community. Not that I am. But other people seem to be. And I would love to know why. But they do. They have. <SEP> You would like to know what they're doing. I would. I really would. They just have beautiful beautiful homes. And they have everything. The kids only wear name brand things to school. And it's one of these things. That makes it hard for you doesn't it. It does. It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now. And it does. <SEP> We do it to a point. But not to where she feels different. <SEP> But some of them are very rich. It's hard to explain to them why you can't. And so we just kind of have everything here. <SEP> And we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are. And so I don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas. <SEP> But the kids are expected to excel in everything. <SEP> And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first. And they're expected to be. Their parents expect it. The teachers expect it. Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system. <SEP> And if you read national surveys they're far from it. And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests. How about the kids. How are they coping with it? Not very well. They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests. <SEP> They make a big deal. To me the paper should just be put on the desk that day. And say just do this. <SEP> I just feel they do better that way. Rather than anticipating. And. <SEP> And I have older children too that now are out of high school. And they've always done this here. It's always been the same. But it's getting worse and worse. Is more pressure for everything. And I just think it's really awful. And I'm with you on that. You don't hear too many people say this. But I think it's a very long day. It is. And my feeling is that you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school. <SEP> That's right. My son came home. And he said Mom all we do is work. <SEP> We hardly ever play. And. And I don't think that's right. I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. Likewise. I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano. <SEP> I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids. Wouldn't that be great. <SEP>. And so I just find this a real problem. I think if they're going to be there all day they should find time. One of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year. And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week. And when she went back in six weeks she was ahead. So what does that tell you? <SEP> Is that right? It tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time. <SEP> And they could be using this time better. For example in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time. After lunch they have some. I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch. And then they have naps or rest period. <SEP> And I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting. That's a very long day for kindergartners. I agree. But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this. <SEP> I wouldn't be surprised. Because they don't want to send them to daycare. I doubt if they would say it was too long. That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day. <SEP> Do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care? We have them at one school like.
