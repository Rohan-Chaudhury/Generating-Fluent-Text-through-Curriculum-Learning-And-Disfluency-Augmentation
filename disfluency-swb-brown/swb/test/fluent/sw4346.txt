. You go first. I have two kids. I have one seven and one five. <SEP> And they're in a public school here in Tyler. And I'm happy with it. I'm happy with the school. It's great. Good teachers. Good curriculum. They learn a lot. They have no problems. But I do live in the best part of the city. Though I live in the real richy part I guess. I'm not. <SEP> But everybody around me is. But they're. I have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town. And their schools are kind of rundown and older. And they don't really offer as much as the school that my girls are in. I don't really think that's fair. But I'm happy with what they're in. Go ahead. <SEP> It's pretty much what I was going to say. Is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in. I grew up in New York. And the place. <SEP> Or not New York City upstate New York. And I went to the City of Rochester School District. <SEP> And a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs. And we weren't too far removed geographically from each other. But the difference in schools was pretty substantial. And one of the things that probably would have been better is if the entire county had just one school system. <SEP> And that could result in more equitable distribution of money. Because what was happening was all the very rich people move out to the suburbs. And the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with. As a result the schools were rundown. There wasn't as many of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked. There wasn't as many advanced placement courses when I was a senior that some other schools had. <SEP> And it. So I think that one of the ways to help schools in general and get them all to a minimum level of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people. And the problem with that is then the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools. <SEP> It's kind of you end up like a dog chasing its own tail sort of. Also the the family environment. You can come to south Tyler where I live. And you have got room mothers in every room. You've got art mothers. You've got every holiday. There's parties. All these kids have these really supportive parents always up there for something. You can go to north Tyler to the schools. And the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. <SEP> That has a whole lot to do with it. As far as their learning if the parents aren't willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning they really don't have much of a chance at all. <SEP> Why is that? <SEP> Why is that? Why you asking. They just don't. I'm up there at my kids' school. I know what they're learning. And if they're up I call and find out. Is she having problems. Does she need help with anything. She's doing fine. And I know kids that their parents could really give a rip. And the kids are not motivated. <SEP>. They have no motivation from home. So they just go to school. And I'll get through the day and bring homework home. And there's nobody to sit them down and say you're going to do this. <SEP> Just they take a notion to do it. They do. And that doesn't work either. They have to have guidance. And they can't just have it at school and then come home. And there's nothing. <SEP> I know that that was a big factor for me. I ended up coming out of the public school system very well and was very good education. Ended up getting some scholarships to go to college which is really nice. <SEP> And I think the difference for me was that they were always there. Was. Of course you're going to study and do well. And that's the way. Of course are you.
