I guess I guess by what you said you're you don't feel your uh privacy has been inva- invaded anytime recently? No. Not really. Uh u- th- uh th- the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's the only thing that bothers me. That's not really invading my privacy. Right. Uh do you feel that yours is invaded? Uh no. I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. Uh you know I would. There there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot. And you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that. And it's real hard to to tell them you know that you're not interested. Or you do tell them you're not interested. And they still keep asking you you know and keep badgering you about it. And that aggravates me. But I don't know that you could call that invading of invading my privacy. Because you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know I want my name unlisted or want my you know. <SEP> But but that doesn't work. It doesn't? Uh no. Because they a lot of times they dial sequentially. They get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something. You put your phone number on there. They pass your phone number on to another company. Oh. Uh or you uh. Or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or s- and stuff. They even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe. <SEP> And uh while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they. Uh-huh. You call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing. <SEP> And the lo- local local papers ask them to remove your na- number from their list. And uh yeah. You call up their regular during regular hours. Their uh they have a special department. They'll take your numbers out of their lists. Uh-huh. Uh but the uh Orlando paper uh yeah they they refused to take it off of the lists. And they call every month. Huh. <SEP> And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have. Good grief. Well let me ask you about this. Here's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately. My fiance received a bill from a a Lord and Taylor company. Uh you know they're a they're a department store. <SEP> Uh-huh. She received a bill from them uh that she had visited some sto-. And and I think it was there in Florida. Maybe it was in Miami. That uh she had visited a store there. And uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise. Uh-huh. Uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number. Uh-huh. Uh and and I've I've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- you know. They use Joe Blow's so- uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit. <SEP> Uh-huh. If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address i- and their mother's maiden name uh you can basically become that uh person. Huh. <SEP> Uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to. Uh-huh. And since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her. Uh if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would ha- whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of uh you know document. Yeah. <SEP> And uh wh-. The signature uh. They should be able to provide you a copy with that signature. And if they can't provide a signature you know they'll have to eat the charge. Yeah. Well y-. But if the pers- has you know their social s- her social security number I'd be real concerned that they uh that she's not uh blacklist on uh Tel- what is it it's Telecredit or something? Yeah. <SEP> Uh because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there. She probably won't be ab- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle. Yeah. Well we got it cleared up eventually. What happened uh.
