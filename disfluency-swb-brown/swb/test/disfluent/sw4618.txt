Go ahead. Uh have you every been tested for a new job or anything? Uh no. I haven't. But in my job I'm a nurse and we are allowed to be. I mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime. Uh I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested. <SEP> So it's just sort of uh. They can if they. They can if they choose to. Oh okay. Right. Have you well wai- have you had any experience with it at all? <SEP> Uh not really. But I've always worked on a university level. But a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff. Uh-huh. So what do you think about that? Uh I don't I don't think they're very accurate. Because I mean I know their lifestyles changed p- prior to the drug test. And I know they changed afterwards. Right. Right. See I know of that too. And I also know that things like antihistamines Sudafeds things like that can really throw it off. And you can not get a job because of it. And they may not tell you the reason why. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I I had a friend. It didn't cause her any problems with her job. But it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen. But what it was was she had been u- she had been uh in the jungle. And it was some Malaria medication. And she tested positive for that. See and so it really is a dangerous thing that way. Because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job. And they weren't told why. But a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing. Or they would tell you. Or this person never use any drugs. <SEP> See I always. I thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests. Uh you should. Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something. I have real mixed feelings about it. I don't know. How do you know how wrong they are? Are they I mean is there a margin of error? The accuracy? I don't know. I don't know. But I know there are a lot of things that can influence them. And I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time. <SEP> Yeah. And if you could show that. I I interviewed for a job recently. And I was taking Entex. And my doctor gave me a prescription for it. Uh-huh. And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know. And it didn't come up that I needed to do it. But this could happen to anybody. And if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. <SEP> And I I'm not so sure they are that needed. Yeah. I'm not sure either. I mean Ye-. The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it. Because they say they can spot check. <SEP> If you're using it while at a job I can see a problem. Yeah. But the occasional person then it's almost like it's almost an infringement of your privacy. Well it sort of is. And this is it. This. I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways. You know as a health professional I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs. <SEP> Yeah. You know so as a patient I feel well yeah we probably should be protected. But on the other hand there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too. So you know I guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way. Yeah. You can't go around testing everybody for everything. <SEP> Yeah. So I don't know. And I I think it could be used to hassle somebody. If someone was out to get you I think that a company or a boss could use this. You know they could keep on doing this to you or something I guess. I can see where it could become a problem. And it it's like it seems like now they have tests. I guess they can test your hair. And they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago. Really. <SEP> Oh wow ! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. So. <SEP> I know. That's the other thing. I mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on. And I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. Yeah. There's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult. Yeah. <SEP> But you can't say it was wrong at the time. I think that's true. Yeah. Yeah. So that probably wouldn't be too good either.
