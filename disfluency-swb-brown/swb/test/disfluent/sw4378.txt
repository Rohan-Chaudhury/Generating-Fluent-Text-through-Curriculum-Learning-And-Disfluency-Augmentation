One way or another we're now recording. Okay. Um um oh yeah. Home repair. <SEP> You were helping your parents. Right. I still am really. They're uh sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta in Candler Park. Uh-huh. And uh we've done lots to it. We've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them. And. <SEP> So you're remodeling? Uh-huh. Okay. How about you? <SEP> Well I I just live in a I live in an apartment now. I uh two summers ago I went to Massachusetts. Uh-huh. And I went with a friend of mine. And we undertook a building house. Uh-huh. <SEP> And this was a a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions. And it's preconstructed you might say. Uh-huh. And we started in uh we started from an empty lot with uh trees and stuff on it. <SEP> And we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot. We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. Pour the basement and uh went from the ground up. Wow. Our one of our main problems was. Wow. <SEP> Well in Massachusetts I thought I was going to. Well it was a a fun time. But I thought gosh summer time you know. Uh-huh. Well all it ever did was rain and thunder storms. <SEP> And one thing is that we're we had we were going to pour the basement foundation. Uh-huh. And we're in the process. And it started pouring down rain. Huh. <SEP> And I guess we had most of it done. But the end was result. What happened was that some of the the wa- a lot of water settled on the top. And it really didn't give a very good finish. And some of the. It was sort of sandy and and not uh a very good finish. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> But it turned it was okay. And it's only the basement floor. So it was okay. Yeah. But uh it kept us pretty busy. It was only uh. There was well me and my friend. And then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a a family type. Uh-huh. <SEP> It wasn't you know like a commercial project or something. It was sort of just you know uh gets your get his you know my bro- my brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes. Uh-huh. Wow. <SEP> And and then materials coming in. Uh-huh. And so we're we're hopping around pretty good. But overall yeah we got it done. And it's a three bedroom two bath house. And it's pretty neat. Nice. <SEP> Yeah. So. Nice. So uh I mean what was it for? You just. Well it was uh for my friend's parents. They had some property there. And they'd lived in this this old. <SEP> It's sort of like a farm you might say. And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something. Uh-huh. And his mom just wanted a a new house. You know. Uh-huh. <SEP> That has been her dream. And so we did that. And uh she was really pleased with it. So it came really great. That's great. So. Wow. <SEP> So what why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot. Huh? Where you live it gets very hot? Yeah. It does. <SEP> And that's why you. An- and the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in? Huh. Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in uh you know the solar game? Right. <SEP> Have you. What what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or. No. We just we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass. My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it. Oh okay. Okay. And uh but it. See in a lot of the windows? <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh it's the house is eighty years old. And it's had several owners and stuff. And uh they have put plastic Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows. Okay. <SEP> Oh these. So you have the sash windows in? Uh-huh. Did t- uh did it go up and down? Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh I see. Yeah. And so uh and and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there. Uh-huh. So. <SEP> Yes. There's a problem with those. Those are uh. They usually most of the time don't open very well. Yeah. Ours didn't. Uh-huh. And the ones that would open uh wouldn't want to stay open. They wanted to slam shut. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And they also there they they. A lot of vibration. And it causes the glass to crack. And it's a never ending problem. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. So.
