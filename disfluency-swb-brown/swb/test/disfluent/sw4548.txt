Well actually uh. I I don't think I'm in the uh majority of in in Texas. I don't think I agree with. <SEP> Oh really. No. You don't believe in it? Uh I wouldn't say that. I think I would have said that a few years ago. <SEP> When I was younger I thought it was uh a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment. But um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion. Yeah. I'm not thoroughly opposed to it. I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment. But I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought. <SEP> You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with. Uh-huh. She has very very black and white opinions you know. There's no gray in her opinions you know. She she probably would agree more with you. But but I don't know. I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again. I've never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done. Yeah. And we see that more and more. Like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know that's fourteen years old. What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult. Yeah. I certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose. Yeah. I'm not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail. But uh. <SEP> No. It doesn't. But it costs less. Yeah. That that's a factor. <SEP> And yeah. To me it is. I mean I work and I pay my taxes. And I lived out in Texas for a little while. And they're. And that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia. I mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in Georgia. Right. But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part. If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well I. The cost is something. But it's but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime. And I guess I would like. I don't know. The European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment. And they they don't have a crime problem either. <SEP> Oh really. No. You can't. They don't execute anybody in Britain or France. And I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either. And they don't have the crime problems we do. I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two. Yeah. I guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when I see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing. And the that that bothers me. <SEP> You might be right. But it. But uh. I mean I I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know. <SEP> I would never in a million years want that job. Huh. But I do believe it's necessary. And I. Yeah. <SEP> On the one hand I I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing. Huh. And I couldn't pull the switch. But uh. Well actually I wha-. The other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it uh I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else. I think it just becomes a uh symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians. So. <SEP> Yeah. I would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh. Right. Like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country. <SEP> Uh-huh. Now I'm I'm not so sure of that. I'm I I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around. <SEP> What what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing? Uh I guess I'm I'm. My view of uh. My. I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh that uh uh costs and other factors justify uh uh executing people. <SEP> Yeah. Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that uh uh than anything else. And uh I've also never been a victim although I have some I have two friends whose wives were murdered. And uh I can imagine that uh uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case. <SEP> Oh gosh. Oh yes. If it ever touched my fam-.
