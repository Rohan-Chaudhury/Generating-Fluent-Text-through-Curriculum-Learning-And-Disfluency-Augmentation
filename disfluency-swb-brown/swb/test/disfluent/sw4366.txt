Well Julie uh are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly? Well I don't know. My grandfather is ninety-two years old. <SEP> Uh-huh. And he is still living by himself. My grandmother died a couple of years ago. But he doesn't want to to move away. He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm. Uh-huh. And he recently had to have an operation. But he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home. <SEP> Is he able to uh still do everything himself pretty well? Well he was until this operation. He has arthritis. Oh yeah. And now I don't really think he's doing that well. And my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him. And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot. <SEP> Yeah. But uh my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three. Uh-huh. And uh died six weeks after they put him in the home. <SEP> Yeah. And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f- grandfather's feelings. Because uh I th- you know I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left. And and for for I'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over. Uh-huh. And I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so I you know I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> They have can look after a lot of things. But there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. Uh I know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home. And they died. But they were all goodness younger than your grandparents. Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing. Uh but I did uh you know I guess. Uh when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do take care of themselves physically. Uh. But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job. And that's that's difficult part. Because I think what they often get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I know like here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in level in four levels. And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care. Generally are not able to look after this- themselves to very to a very great extent physically. Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease or those or or physical and mental handicaps. Uh you know where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. Even though it may be minimal. Uh-huh. And uh but I think that it can be helpful in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need. Uh. But I don't I mean. At least I mean I think some nursing homes do that. But I think a lot of nursing homes really uh are guilty of neglect. <SEP> Yeah. I th- and I think it happens more in areas where it's uh I guess uh a broad social medical system where uh you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing. If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals. And and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding. I think that a majority of the places in the U S uh you know there is some government aid available. But the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay. Uh-huh. And uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely.
