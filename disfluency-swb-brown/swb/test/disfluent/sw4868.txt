Budgeting activity in our household I has is uh uh kind of an informal kind of situation. We we you know put. Actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited. I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore. It just gets deposited. And and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in. And you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. You see. And so our our budgeting. W- we really don't have a formal budgeting situation. Every time I've ever tried one it's uh I've just got wrapped in my inertia. And uh I've just decided not to pursue it. Uh what what's your budget situation? <SEP> Well actually uh I've I've had a couple of different situations. My current one has been the most successful. Uh at a certain point in life. An- my husband my ex-husband was an alcoholic. And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies. And that left me with three teenagers. You know well a- a- actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it? It certainly is. <SEP> But at any rate what happened was that I I just absolutely put away all the credit cards. I didn't rip them up. I didn't send them back. Nothing. I just put them away. Because there was one that it was really handy to have. If I absolutely had to have something I could go use it. Uh-huh. But uh mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had. And if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it. But then as things improved you know. Once once I got them all through college uh it came to the point where uh. My parents came through the depression. I'm not sure how old you are. Well my you know my my parents too. You you you were born in in the in the late thirties or early forties. <SEP> But my. Late thirties. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> And uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house. And that's kind of the way I was raised. And so I'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect. So for quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money. Um. Now meanwhile I got had a a building bank balance. And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there. And not ever have to spend any money on interest. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well that that's good. And that that's the way I've operated ever since then. It. And you know if if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it. Well we we buy what well. We just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher. <SEP> Oh my. And and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars. Oh my !. And you know. <SEP> Oh my. Right. I mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in. But but we also have zero in- interest being paid. And we pay it off as as it goes. Uh-huh. And that's the way I do my credit cards now. Yeah. So we never really get that much over uh over extended. <SEP> Yeah. I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards. Huh. But it's the fact that I have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full. Yeah. We're we're doing that. We have you know uh. Th- this is our our our big uh. We did redecorating. Two you know two new pieces in the ref- in the family room and new carpet. I mean we just uh we've just been spending spending spending. <SEP> Oh my. I'm envious. Well I. Bu- but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year. <SEP> Uh-huh. So we're you know we don't have that. It's time for you to do these things then. Right? Yeah. It's uh it's about time that we did that. But th- the the terrible part about it. I've looked at it all. And it all looks still pretty good to me. Why why we need to replace it? <SEP> But but un- unfortunately my my my wife really feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate uh thing to to I mean. That rug is thirteen years old. Why not replace it. I mean uh I say it might go for another thirteen. But uh too late we'll never find that out. This is so funny. That's wonderful. But you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it. And. <SEP> I mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not. You know I I I don't spend that much money. I just uh we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know. We sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they they got through school. And that was the major you know decade of expenses you know. So we we feel as uh. But as far as any formal budgeting uh you know I I we just apparently have been very fortunate. When we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat. We never really you know have to program money for that or make choices you know. But uh we don't have that uproarious a a lifestyle. After all we're.
