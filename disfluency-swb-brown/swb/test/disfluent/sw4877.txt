Okay. Uh so your you I guess you're probably in the same uh same situation uh we're in. We're kind of past having to provide child care. Our our kids are grown up. We don't have any grandchildren yet. But uh uh they're. Uh-huh. How old are your children? <SEP> Uh one's twenty-six. And the other is uh twenty twenty-one. Uh-huh. So they're uh uh They're they're getting there. Well they're going to be getting there. <SEP> You know there's no no no prospects right away for anything to happen. Yeah. U- uh-huh. Oh I see. <SEP> But uh. I have uh five children. I have a eighteen year old son. The rest of my girls are like twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine. Uh-huh. And I have three granddaughters right now. <SEP> Oh. And uh I uh. One's in Iowa. Uh-huh. And uh she's she's a teacher. And what she does is she teaches at a preschool. <SEP> Oh okay. And and so she kind of. And they let her bring her her little daughter in for free. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then so. But she just works part-time. Uh-huh. Then I have another daughter in uh Bountiful Utah. And she has to work full-time. And it's just tearing her apart. She has a private baby-sitter. <SEP> Yeah. And uh the baby just screams. I mean the baby is like seventeen months. And she just screams. Uh-huh. Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there. They're not even there yet you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. It's hard. We. And and then I have my uh uh I have a seven month old granddaughter. And uh her mother stays home. And she they live they live with us. You know in as Orange County is really expensive. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. They live with us. And so of course we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time. But uh uh she just. Uh she used to work in pre in the preschool and and and child care. And she says after working in there. And and you know here she was a provider. But you know there's only so much one person can do. <SEP> Yeah. She said it's so awful. She said she'll never put her child in a in a in a preca- in a p- in a preschool. Uh-huh. I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere. <SEP> Huh. But it's really it's really really very difficult. And. Yeah. What did you do when your kids were growing up? Were you. Well when when. The uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years I stayed home. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh then after that I I went to work. Uh-huh. And uh uh uh a couple of times I just uh uh you know. Th- then I had one job. And then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job. And then and then like about later I I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter. Supposed to be good uh recommended person from the church. And I knew her personally. She had two kids of her own and everything. But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean first of all uh her children were sick all the time. So when my son stayed over there he got sick. He got sick. Yeah. Same thing same thing that the her kids had. Right? <SEP> Right. Well. And so uh we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock. Then he she'd take my son and her daughter over t- to kindergarten. But s-. That day uh I was saying now he he's sick. And she goes well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have. That's what he got you know. Goes well okay. So it's not like he's going to infect her kids. But then what happened was is I said uh he just threw up. And kindergarten starts at eleven thirty. So she said well she'll keep him home. And he'll probably just sleep anyway. Well you know what. That woman sent her sent him to kindergarten. She sent him to kindergarten. As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him. And he threw up again. And they put him in the nursery uh they put him in the nurse's office. <SEP> Guess so. Yeah. And then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter. Called her. And they said uh that he's sick. Well she wasn't home. Huh. I mean her all her kids were sick. But she wasn't home right. And her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick. Now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her? No. She didn't do that. So it got to the point where he's he's supposed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty. And I had to leave work. It was it was five o'clock in the evening. And I found out he was still there at school. And they were calling me. And they said somebody's got to pick him up. And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school. I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. And he had a hundred and four fever. They couldn't uh give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything. <SEP> Right. I was so furious. I I quit that job. And I stayed home for awhile longer. Then I went and got a uh a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better. Yeah. A little more flexibility. You can come and go. Yeah. But uh I haven't had any good really very good experience with child care. <SEP> Yeah. When when our kids were small we had a couple of uh good good women who uh would often c- uh get them to come to the house.
