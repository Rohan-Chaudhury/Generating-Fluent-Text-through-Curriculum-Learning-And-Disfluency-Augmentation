Well uh does the company you work for test for drugs? Actually uh they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting. Because w- when I went to work for them uh they didn't do that. But uh since then they've they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own uh convictions but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that. Huh. <SEP> How about you? Uh no. We're not being tested for drugs at all uh. Our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or its reasons for immediate dismissal. Uh-huh. It says use of narcotics on company premises. <SEP> Um. So that's pretty general. But uh I work for an environmental management firm. Okay. And I'm an engineer there. But I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites. But I don't operate any machinery. <SEP> Yeah. Now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a a medical monitoring program. Uh-huh. Because they're at a higher risk of exposure. And blood screening is part of that. And I I think that drugs. They do test for drugs in that capacity. But it's not their exclusive. It's just part it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. <SEP> Yeah. But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field. What is the nature of your company's business? Well it's actually uh. We do oil well services. So a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies. And they go out to. We have engineers who uh go out to the oil well to the to the client's oil well and and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff. So the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their their you know territory and everything. But the thing that's interesting is that I w- I'm an engineer and a software engineer. Um. <SEP> And I work in the software uh house. And everybody there you know are all software engineers. They've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything. And yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh th- all the engineers have to to. Well a little different actually. But uh you know we have to go through the same thing. And it's but it's uh it's a little different I guess than than a lot of drug policies. In our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you. And then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away. Oh really? Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that. But a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first. Particularly like uh we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol. And tha- they didn't find any problem with that you know. But. Right. <SEP> Uh. We that's been an a an issue uh in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening. In fact they'll have these little parties. And people will just get. I mean I've. My brother lives where I work. And I have many a time called him to come get me you know. And uh uh but y- you know they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know. Yeah. But uh I think drug testing. And I I don't know. I guess I k- I think it's got some relevance. But I think its relevance is pretty limited. I mean I think you know. In your case I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. <SEP> Yeah. I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. Yeah. It's really it's really bizarre. Uh particularly like where we are you know. I I. There was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle. And she she was a personnel secretary. And she had to get tested. And I don't know. I'm ambivalent about the whole thing. I you know I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if you know. They're they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense. And you know it's like you're I mean employments are contractual by nature anyway. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that where I had to uh uh do a drug test. And and it's it was kind of a long story. But it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through. And it amounted to uh going in uh before any of these interviews. I'm not even working for this company. I'm going in for like interviews. And they flew me out to Chicago. And and uh before I went into any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical. They said it was going to be a physical you know. And uh actually bec- beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening. But I had forgotten about that. And so basically I'd already peed off in that morning. And and when I got in there I didn't I wasn't like able to give a full sample. And so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again. Oh. Right. <SEP> And the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating. You go in there with the doctor. He makes you take off all your clothes. And then he examines you.
