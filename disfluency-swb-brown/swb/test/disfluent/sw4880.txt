Okay. Well uh I'll let you start I guess. Well uh yeah. I I'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing. And I've got some very definite uh opinions about it. Uh you know which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it. But uh developed a little more I guess but haven't changed that much. What about you? Are you uh in- involved at all? Uh no. I mean I'm not. My employer does not do that. Uh although uh I had an ex-employer that. Uh the previous job I used to have uh they. After I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test. <SEP> Yes. Uh I I don't know. My feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb uh if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I I'd be willing to support that. For example uh uh well uh uh train engineers. Yeah. Because it you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer you know. <SEP> Right. He crashed and killed some people because he was uh smoking some marijuana. And I guess air traffic controllers. I wouldn't want them to be on drugs. And airplane pilots. But where it's not necessary uh in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh I I'd I would seriously question it. Yeah. Uh so. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It uh that's that's mine. It it you know. I I go back. It to me no matter how much the th- our company claims it's not a constitutional issue. That because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government. It's not. The Constitution doesn't apply. But I it it seems to me that it still should. I I our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor. Uh and so it's it's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts. And I'd I'd. So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent? Yes. Okay. An- and our company has taken that and gone all the way. Say. Okay uh. First off we don't we don't have enough courage to uh pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage uh because that would offend them uh if they if they weren't. So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even. <SEP> Uh and and uh. Yeah. Well i-. <SEP> Then uh. But and they. So it's a a complete random testing. W- well it's random in the sense that you don't know when. It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested. Huh. Uh and uh you know I I sit at a terminal and and write software all day. It it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in in my job. Right. And. <SEP> And and uh yes. I I agree that there are there are uh jobs that are definitely life threatening. And and and th- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at rea- reasonable and proper. I- you know. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I mean it's well there's also the issue of uh. O- o- out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of. There was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results. O- or I shouldn't say high. Well. I mean several percent. <SEP> Yeah. I that that I that I will give credit to to our our company for in that that I think there's there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh of drugs. And e- e- essentially the first thing is t- is on the order of paper in the urine and uh or some you know. It's not quite that simple. But it's fairly simple. Kind of a coarse kind of test. Coarse kind of test. And then there's a a much more uh uh refined test uh uh spectrography or whatever it's called. The chemo- chemotography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are. Is that done. <SEP> Right. And uh. Now l- let me ask you this. Uh e- e- at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any. <SEP> No. I I've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now. Okay. So that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this. And uh. <SEP> No. And it and it and it has it has you know. They did that three or four years before they did it with everybody. And I uh at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know. But on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test.
