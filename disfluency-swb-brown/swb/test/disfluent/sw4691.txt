Oh so. Okay. I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so. Well it. Let's put it this way. We've got the New England Patriots up here. So. <SEP> Oh yeah. Right. Well. They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years. Really? Yeah. <SEP> Why? Um well uh partly due to ownership. You know uh Victor Kiam owned the uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years. Uh-huh. And he always had this uh this wonderful quality of c- being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something. And uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth. And it recently was sold to uh some other people. So hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England area anyways. <SEP> Yeah. Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you. Oh yeah. I've been to a couple I've been to a few games before. <SEP> Uh-huh. Now you you're you're from Texas. Right. So you've got two football teams down there. <SEP> Well it depends on where you're from in Texas. I live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned. Uh-huh. Oh I see. <SEP> That's how it is. There's that type of segregation huh? It's divided. Yeah. Wow !. <SEP> It really is. So we've got our Cowboys here. And and uh I don't think anybody roots differently. Uh-huh. But I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno. Do you. <SEP> And he is for the L the uh Raiders. L A Raiders. Uh-huh. So. Do you follow professional sports at all? <SEP> Well I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well. But I've been trying more this year. I think I know a little more than I use to. Yeah. <SEP> I never knew very much at all. So I'm trying. Well it's a good past time you know. Yeah. Particularly football. They say uh i- football attracts more men because of the you know y- the you see the the physical aggression on the field. And supposedly psychologists say that uh that uh men take out their frustrations by watching football. And you know they get together with a bunch of guys. And they uh uh and they have a good time and everything. And that's suppose to be some of the uh the male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts I guess or something about the uh. <SEP> So I shouldn't even try to do it huh? Well no. It it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest. Yes. I think that uh. I personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport. It has the speed. <SEP> Right. And the hand eye coordination. And it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey. Yeah. So we. And. That's. We're a big hockey area up here. I bet up here in New England as well as you know in in the Minnesota area. <SEP> Really. But. I don't even think we have that in Texas. What hockey? <SEP> We might. Do we? I mean no. You probably know. I don't know. No. There's no hockey. There's no. <SEP> Nobody talks about it. So I don't think we do. There's no professional hockey teams in in Texas. No. Uh-huh. And we have a soccer team that comes and goes. We don't even have that very much. So. Yeah. I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like they have this World Football League. You see we have the N F L that that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams. Yeah. There are those teams that play in professional National Football League. But uh now they have what's called the World Football League. And they have all these teams from. There's a team in London. And there's a team there there's uh teams other European teams. <SEP> Oh. And there's teams in the United States. An- and they're playing now during the summer months. And it's really you know overkill. Oh yeah. And there's only so much football you can watch. <SEP> Yeah. Well I like to do. I don't like to watch. Yeah. That's good. I don't like to watch anything. So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff. I think it's an excuse to do nothing. <SEP> And I I can see what you're saying about the male bonding. And the guys get together. Yeah. And that's kind of cool. That's fun you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> But it can get really overdone. Now have you ever been to a professional football game? Yeah. I have. Have you? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I have. Did you do the whole big th- the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole. Uh no. Actually no. Well see now see that's what you got to do see. Now we talked our. <SEP> I've done that for college football. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You the. Well the same thing. <SEP> Yeah. We we talked our wives. There's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games. And uh we talked our wives into going with us one time. And they had a real good time. And it was basically for the social atmosphere. Right. And that's the thing you know. You go you know three or four hours before the game. You go set up. We set a table up. We do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more. <SEP> Yeah. But but that whole. It it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself. But it's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game. I-. <SEP> Yeah. That you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with with a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know. That's right. You you miss that. <SEP> Yeah. That's right. And and any professional sport I think you miss that. <SEP> Uh-huh. The atmosphere of being there you know. Yeah. Well in high school I went to every football game. And well I twirled you know. <SEP> Yep. And I you know I didn't. I still don't know that much about football obviously. But I still had a good time. You know. Well foot-.
