So what kind of music you into? Well I have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music. In fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that I don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal. The opera yeah it's right on track. I like classical. But I can't deal with opera at all. <SEP> And heavy metal uh it's noisy. I'm into uh some industrial music that's a a bit even harder than that. Uh-huh. But it's it's got to have a point to it. <SEP> Oh I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to. But uh the the uh basic point of heavy metal w- which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying. <SEP> Yeah. What kind of progressive stuff? <SEP> Uh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh oh you know. I'm thirty. So lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and R E M that sort of stuff. Uh. Uh R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point. And it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of people l- like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think that's pretty much you know bull. Because R E M really hasn't changed. If it's it's interesting. They're producing uh similar music. And it's good music. <SEP> Uh-huh. But you know people have picked up on it. That's good. <SEP> I think it is. I'm impressed. Uh for a while there music seemed to really ha- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it. I was really tired of uh the Michael Bolton. <SEP> Mi- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes. Oh yeah. <SEP> And I could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money. Uh but he picked the right songs. And and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has for that matter. I guess. <SEP> That and a marvelous hairdo. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm sure that that so- that sold a lot for him. That's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop. I'm ki- I've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop. <SEP> It just seems like there's no no real point. You hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises. Uh-huh. And. <SEP> Well i- it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music. Uh-huh. And I like a lot of classical music. But I also dislike uh some classical music. And what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time. <SEP> Yeah. I can I can believe that. What kind of things are you do you like in classical? What's the standard? Uh. <SEP> Stuff that I like. Uh I like Bach. I tolerate Vivaldi. I can't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy. <SEP> Uh uh I like Tchaikovsky. He can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined. Oh yes. Uh and some of some stuff that I like uh. For instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's interesting music. But it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive. <SEP> You know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth. That's right you know. W- we'll do we'll do the ninth. And everyone will know it and and hum it. It's safe. <SEP> And i- it it just isn't chance taking enough for me. Uh I feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times.
