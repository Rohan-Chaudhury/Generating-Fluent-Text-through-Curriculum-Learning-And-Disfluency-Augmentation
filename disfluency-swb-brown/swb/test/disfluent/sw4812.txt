So how do you feel about it? Uh I I don't see any problem with with testing for random drugs. Yeah. I I myself almost uh am in favor of it. Uh I work at Honeywell. And I went through a a pretty I don't know I went through a standard drug testing thing before I I was brought on. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think that's pretty standard. At least at Honeywell it is. Uh I think it's important to insure the quality and and uh I don't know almost the goodness of character. You know that kind of thing. Yeah. Where do you work? <SEP> Uh well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon. Oh okay. Oh okay. And I I just came from Saint Paul. Uh interviewing with Three M. Huh. <SEP> Oh great. And uh they have a policy for uh testing. If you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start. Right. <SEP> And I guess the only drawback I can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> But i-. Yeah. And that that definitely happens you know. I mean those the drug tests sure they're accurate. But there's always that margin of error. Yeah. And that's that's something to be aware of. Another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate. They aren't that sensitive. Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that. <SEP> Yeah. You know I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell. And uh uh you know I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something. Uh I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types. Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this. And then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for. Right. Uh I don't know. What what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon? <SEP> Uh electrical engineering. Oh okay. Great. Uh yeah. I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida. Oh wow. And this is actually a an internship up here. <SEP> But uh they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing. So. They test you uh before they before you start or before you even interview. Right. <SEP> Or. Uh they essentially. No. I sure don't uh. They essentially uh they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that. So uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests. And and then they essentially give you the offer. Uh-huh. And then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that. <SEP> Oh. So uh there's some noise on this end. I'm actually in a mall calling. So. Oh. You probably wondered huh. But. <SEP> Yeah. Wh- what happens if you were to fail? Then do they give you like one ch- one more chance or two more chances? Yes. That's a good question. I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail I believe they give you one more chance. They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it. Uh-huh. But uh you know once again those things are not that accurate. So there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know. But uh wha-. Are you working right now anywhere. Or. <SEP> Uh no. Okay. I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and uh just interviewing with companies right now. Oh okay. Great. <SEP> Yeah. That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know. Was was going to Honeywell. A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there. Uh-huh. And he's doing an internship with I B M. <SEP> Oh. And uh they basically uh did the same exact thing. Uh we both got our internships at the same time. And we both had to go through drug testing at the same time. So one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process. But uh. Did do they test you at right now at work too? No. No. That's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job. <SEP> Okay. Uh I think I think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it. But they don't do it. Oh. You know so. That's good I guess. I don't know. I mean I uh I have gone to a couple of parties since since that time. And while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there uh you know smoking a joint or whatever. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know. But no. They don't they don't really do that. So. Wow. Is it formal policy that they said they might test? Yeah.
