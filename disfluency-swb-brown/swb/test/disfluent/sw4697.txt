Well th- the question was talking about the juries. And uh one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that uh. Maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again. Uh so that uh a judge I think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. Right. I I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases uh the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed. <SEP> Right. <SEP> Uh I I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case. Right. So a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there. Uh-huh. <SEP> And if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri- position to give an appropriate uh sentencing. Yeah. See I agree with you. Uh one thing I heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court. I mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything. Uh you go. And you present your case. The other side presents their case. And you're done with it. It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. Uh-huh. Uh and uh but it's not that we have uh such. It didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending. Uh so I. That was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. <SEP> In other words not not. There would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? Yes. Yes. Now. <SEP> I I I don't. Th- there's a point on which we don't agree. Uh-huh. I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a one of the parties wants one. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I usually it is the defendant I guess that wants to have the jury hear the case. Sure. So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know. <SEP> That would require a change in the Bill of Rights I believe. And so. Oh yes. And and I wasn't I didn't mean that. Oh oh okay. I I didn't mean that no. Because I mean gee whiz if I was uh uh didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that oh. Yes I would feel uh you're right that my civil rights had been violated. But I meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here. We're not going to have a jury you know. Let's get it over with. Sort of like car accidents you know. <SEP> Right. Well I think that's all ready possible. Yeah. I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Right. <SEP> So. I agree that that should be encouraged. Uh-huh. People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial. But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into per- giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher uh you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award. Right. Giving a different sentence. <SEP> Uh-huh. The take. Right. <SEP> Yeah. And I suspect it in cases like. I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil. Is that right? Well I I i- we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well uh in the case of civil uh things I think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage. <SEP> And I think that may be where jury use is overdone. I mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently. <SEP> Right. Right. <SEP> But the lawyers are really uh. It's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible. Uh-huh. <SEP> So. Uh I was wondering too if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in in a criminal cases. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that. But I am in favor of it for criminal cases. So there's a difference of my view there for those two. Right. Right. Yeah. Bu- well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that. Have you ever had to serve jury duty? N-. Well I was called once when I was nineteen. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me. And I was doing school and things like. They they let me out. Uh-huh. An- I've never had to it since. And that was almost twenty years ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. It isn't. Sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in uh. That would have been about uh twenty years too. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh uh just last year. And uh the case I heard was a criminal case. And it seemed it really trivial. It involved two bicycles. Uh-huh. <SEP> We didn't do the sentencing. The judge did. Huh. So. How interesting. <SEP> We we a- rendered a verdict. And then the judge was the one to do the sentencing. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And that was here in Wisconsin. So I I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it.
