Uh let's see. How about uh let's see about ten years ago. Uh what do you think was different ten years ago from now? Well I would say as far as social changes go uh I think families were more together. They they did more things together. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh they ate dinner at the table together. Uh the parents usually took out time uh you know more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity. Uh-huh. Uh although I'm not a mother I I still think that uh a lot has changed since ten years ago. Uh what do you think about that? We. <SEP> Well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short. Yeah. Uh but I do agree that uh generally it's society has sort of uh let's see rushed everything ahead. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I don't know. It leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that. In other words they just prioritize their lives differently. But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation. Yes. What about like as far as uh social changes in the individual? Do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago? Uh. <SEP> Um. It depends. Uh it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too. Uh-huh. Uh I just. <SEP> Well how how old are you? I'm twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. Okay. I'm twenty-three. Yeah. <SEP> So there's maybe a five year gap between us. Yeah. So uh. I just I think that things were a bit were have been busy all along. It's just a matter where priorities are at placed. And that uh usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home. <SEP> Huh. Yes. <SEP> Uh-huh. And now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work. Do you think it's an economic c- necessity. Or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living? I think that's part of it too. But I do think. <SEP> I mean do you think people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs or. No. No. I don't. <SEP> No. I don't think that. But then there are a lot of people that that don't have that. But that really do need to work. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive. And then there th- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that uh they think is is surviving which is really more luxuries. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Okay. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh but I I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive. Yo- so you think it's. Which group are you saying is the one trying? I'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living. <SEP> Uh-huh. Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing uh middle class in this country I think that that's in my opinion the case. Uh-huh. <SEP> Okay. So. I mean I have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job. Okay. And then sometimes I I often uh find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. Yo- a microwave a V C R a answering machine a you know a special a dishwasher uh a refrigerator and some of those items um for the for the uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well I guess we're sticking more to social changes. But uh people want all of that. Uh-huh. And not all of those are necessities. Right. <SEP> So they're trying to. It has become a necessity.
