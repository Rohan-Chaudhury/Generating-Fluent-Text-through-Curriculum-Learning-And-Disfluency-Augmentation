Okay. Thanks. Huh. Do you all have a budget? Well uh yeah. We we do. Um we've been married for twenty-three years. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we have uh three teenage daughters. And you know they're very expensive. So uh uh we yeah we have somewhat of uh a system. Uh it's it's kind of uh you know it's kind of hard to explain. Yeah. We've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts. We always had just one. <SEP> Uh-huh. And now we are having two. Uh it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal. Yeah. It's uh. So I have to be. That's that's kind of the way I feel about it. <SEP> Yeah. I usually uh. My wife handles a lot of the day to day finances. And of course we're ju- like ther- like a lot of people. We just scramble through month to month you know. Yes. And uh. Do you have a two income family or one income? <SEP> Uh we have a two income uh family. Yeah. She also works. Yeah. <SEP> And uh but she she enjoys it. And she's good at it. Uh if it's if it's. I am kind of uh uh I'm pretty bad about procrastinating. Uh-huh. And one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> You know how that goes. But uh uh if she she handles it pretty well. She uh she writes all the checks you know once a month. So your wife. Yes. It. That. What. Her is her career uh related to to finance or accounting? <SEP> Uh sort of on a peripheral. She's uh uh an annuity administrator. Oh. And so she uh she works for an insurance company. Uh-huh. <SEP> But but she enjoys it. She likes keeping track of all that stuff. And uh. Yeah. So that's sort of related to her field a little bit. Yeah. Sort of. Yeah. <SEP> And we you know we've experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh. But if you know. You have to keep up with them. So a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear. We try to keep our uh our retirement and our savings kind of automated. Yeah. So we never see that money. Just like taken directly. It's just taking it out right. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. We do the same thing. And that that's kind of handy. Yeah. Because if you don't see it you don't miss it. Yeah. If. <SEP> You don't spend it. You have something to take it out. That's exactly what we've always done. Yeah. And we've had uh they've always had uh where they match your funds you know. Sometimes if you if you save so much then they will match it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh that you know we've done that too. But my husband works for an insurance company. Uh-huh. And he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years I guess. But he was with another company before that. But we have we have. I I work also. But I only have a part time job. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I get paid very little. But uh you know I try to use that money for food mo-. Jim gives me a certain amount money. You know we just transfer it into my account. Yeah. Uh-huh. And then I use that for food household expenses. And then I add my own check to that. And then with that I try and handle you know some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that. <SEP> Yeah. But the expenses that we need and have around the house. Yeah. It sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do. So. <SEP> Just kind of play it by ear but keep the the deductions you know. Yeah. Yeah. We. <SEP> Well Jim has Jim has a budget. I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down. Uh-huh. Uh you know. I am given so much mon- money a month. So I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I try not to you know. We don't you know I don't ask for more. I mean I just try and make it on that. Uh-huh. Yeah. Because I think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. And uh you can you can really waste a lot of money that way. <SEP> Yeah. So uh well how long have you been married? Uh about five years. Yeah. Oh yeah. So you're just really getting started. <SEP> So do you have a family too? Uh I've got one little girl. She's like uh nineteen months. Oh yeah. Yeah. <SEP> So uh she's she's not uh. She hasn't effected your budget yet really. Not not really. Not too bad. Uh. No. Not like she will later on. <SEP> Yeah. You will see that all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do. Yeah. When. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know. Yeah. What can we do here. And then you have to really sit down and plan some more. And uh but I think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget. <SEP> Yeah. And then as the girls got older I think we we did more and more of that. You know more budgeting as as they got older. Uh-huh. Uh but uh but what do you do? Do you. <SEP> I'm uh I I work for I'm an electronic technician. Oh okay. I work at a for a university. Uh Georgia Tech uh research. Oh. Well good. <SEP> And uh. Good. So I just uh. Well we just have you know we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta. I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things. I'd better get back to the subject. <SEP> Oh well. But uh budgeting. I found you know I feel a lot better. You know we use to work out of one check book. Uh-huh. And it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month. <SEP> Yeah. Now I have know exactly what I'm spending. And it's so much easier.
