Okay. So what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products? Uh not too bad really. Uh I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just I really didn't want it. But I got it anyway. And uh it was a Braun. And they were real good about taking it back. It wasn't a problem at all. So uh I was able to get that back pretty easily. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh I don't know. I really haven't returned a whole lot lately. Have you? I haven't had to. It's uh the. Every so often. I mean I I I'm almost pushing it myself. Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's. And it shrinks too much. And say well I should have known better. I mean I bought it from G I Joe's. Um. And it was probably made in China by slaves. <SEP> Right. But uh they uh. Most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway I get pretty good stuff. Yeah. I think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized. <SEP> Right. Like. And if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find. Exactly. It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S. <SEP> I was reading. Right. I was reading something in uh CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact. They were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out. And about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever. Yeah. Uh like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger. And and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi. Huh. <SEP> You know so it's like what are you going to do you know? Yeah. Really. But uh that's the way it is. I don't know. I I personally feel that uh uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them you know that's the way it goes. And you know people man- more than manufacturers should get a clue. And you know they should start making quality products. Yeah. I think they're beginning to. The the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away. And. <SEP> That's what I thought too until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue. Uh-huh. Uh they've got all the American well all the all the cars rated you know. And uh essentially I h- I don't see much of a trend. I mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there. There's nothing wrong with them. Uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars. But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy. And they're pieces of junk. I know. Still at it hey. <SEP> Yeah. That's ninety that's eighty-six through ninety-one. Wow. But uh I don't know. May- maybe they're getting better. Maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh. Well they got a three year lead time. It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so. <SEP> Yeah. That's just it. Technology that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road. But uh. The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer. Oh yeah. Yeah. Because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time. And can you think of any other industry where in software they. <SEP> Uh. If the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail s-. Yeah. Or uh maybe I say well you know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade. <SEP> Yeah. It. Uh th- they keep up c- with it pretty quickly. And that's that's a real good thing I guess. Yeah. <SEP> Uh I don't know. And the hardware well I mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity. And the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along. Yeah. <SEP> Right. They're kind of the leaders right now you know. I used to see all those commercials for Windows you know. And you're like oh gee they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name. Really. Why don't they just say almost a Mac for half the price. <SEP> Yeah you know. They'd sell more if they were honest. Exactly. Almost is the key word there too you know because I I really I've used both. And I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all. Yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. Base. <SEP> Uh. Yeah yeah that's true too. <SEP> But uh I don't know. I'm really I've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home. I I do use a Mac at work. But uh uh I really don't don't do much with it at home. Uh-huh. But uh. Apple's sort of making a s-. And they're ones were. Growling consumer uh need to worry about the Mac they're getting. Like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back. They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. Yeah. You sound like you must uh work in the computer business. Yeah. I have one. I do desktop publishing at work. And I have a machine at home. And I belong to the user's group. And I I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out. <SEP> Yeah? All right. But uh technically I'm not actually in the industry. I don't work a computer company. No? I'm an abuser. <SEP> Well that's that's all right. But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen. Yeah. That's true. <SEP> Something that I find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer. And you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know. Let let's take the example the modem for you know. Yeah. Okay. W- w- what baud rate do you get? Well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-.
