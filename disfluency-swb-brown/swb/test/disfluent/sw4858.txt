Uh I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't. And uh I guess uh looking back on it I tend to think it was pretty uh mostly a mistake. Uh-huh. On the other hand uh the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental uh decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh but on the whole I think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do. How about you? Well I'm uh I I was just uh in high school I guess when it when it ended. Uh-huh. <SEP> Ended up being. I was in the last last lottery. Yeah. And I was glad it was over by then. Right. <SEP> I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there. Just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like. Yeah. You know we uh. Those people that I know. I work with several that were over there. And for some of them it was just kind of I don't know not so much a holiday. I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods. And ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles. And then they'd come back. <SEP> And you know. Yeah. But that they weren't really allowed to do anything. I uh. To me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway. Yeah. It's funny. Tonight I was uh helping my kid with an essay on uh Stalin. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how uh in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war. And actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh. I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh they're certainly all leaders. And uh and uh with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them. Yeah. And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the uh people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it. Otherwise there'd be they'd get you someplace else. <SEP> Uh-huh. Looking back it seems like that was only partly true. That uh there might have been a better place to draw the line. Uh I guess you can I guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight uh brought the cold war to an end. But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to uh call the bully out and beat him. And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war. They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward. And uh we were wrong. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I uh you know. The like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable. But the accumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation where. And as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than uh committing uh committing to a completely and uh winning it whatever that would mean. Yeah. Well I I I think we did I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh we weren't prepared for. I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war. Yeah. <SEP> Uh I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war. I mean they seemed like a valiant thing. Yeah. You knew you knew who was good. You knew who was bad. Yeah. <SEP> And it was a it was a traditional m- the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is. Well you're not. But in in the Vietnam war it seems like it was. A a the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad. And and uh you know the. It's ambivalent. Yeah. <SEP> Even. It seems like even the people you know. Had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and of course the Laotians. And the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved. But. What what about the domestic effects. Like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it uh possible and even popular to uh criticize the government. And they. That pendulum started to swing uh ma- maybe even too far. To the point where uh uh supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And that tradition is still. I mean it's dying now. But it's still alive as opposed to. This Desert Storm stuff may have uh killed it. Yeah. But I think that was one of the biggest. That you know the uh th- the domestic unrest.
