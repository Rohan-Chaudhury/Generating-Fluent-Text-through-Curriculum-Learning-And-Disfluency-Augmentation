Okay Randall uh uh. Do you have any special interest in uh space flight? Oh yeah. Ever since I was a young and uh used to watch the old uh Apollo missions going off in uh classroom T V -s. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off. Uh-huh. Uh very exciting. Yeah. <SEP> The uh uh. I've al- I've always uh w- wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that. And uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen. Uh-huh. Of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately. What do you do now? Uh computer programmer. Oh. <SEP> Unfortunately that can be done from the ground. Yeah. To bad huh. Yeah. Made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space. <SEP> The uh uh. I used to think when I was when I was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh frustrating at times. Uh-huh. <SEP> I don't know what you think about all that. Well uh yo- I uh I'm kind of young. I'm only twenty-two. And so uh uh I'm not you know. There's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all. Although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties. Uh-huh. Uh although I have a. I I kind of wonder uh if some if it were possible to market some uh form of uh space technology you know to uh uh to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the uh respect that you know there's endless amounts of research to be done. Endless amounts of resources and and whatnot. <SEP> Yeah. It would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy. Well Yeah. <SEP> Well the uh uh. I've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up. Uh-huh. Uh because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact. Exactly. <SEP> And you can just get as much power as you need up there. Uh-huh. It's just a matter of how big you build it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing. So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good you know very very good for al- for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also. So I'm. Right. Yeah. It seems like uh there's. So you're talking about positive side effects then. Yeah. Right. Okay. I understand. <SEP> Right. Uh Right. Sure. That makes a lot of sense. The only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And they want to do the research. And uh they're all you know nor-. Yeah. <SEP> The only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to Mars. Which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth. Right. Exactly. But the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and you know so forth. Uh-huh. <SEP> It it would de- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of instead of for you know. Uh-huh. We should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so. Right. <SEP> We should do it because for for the return we get for it. Uh-huh. And uh unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened. Exactly. Least not. <SEP> I I would settle for the gli- for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the uh. But uh. Yeah. The downside of that is you after you do one of those people say well we did it. Right. <SEP> Now let's now we're done. Now we're done. <SEP> No need to use this anymo- to play around with this space stuff anymore. That's what happened with Apollo. Uh But uh I'd give almost anything to get into space. Yeah. I think you're right. I would too. I'd I'd uh. Was it John Denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle?
