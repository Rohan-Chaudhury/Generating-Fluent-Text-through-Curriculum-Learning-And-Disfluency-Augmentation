Okay. So What kind of experience do you do you have then with child care? I guess I think uh I wonder if that worked. <SEP> Does it say something? I think it usually does. You might try uh. I don't know. Hold it down a little longer. And see if it uh. Okay. Well Does it usually make a recording or s-. <SEP> Okay. I Well I don't remember. It seemed like it did. But it might not. I guess I guess we can start. Uh. Okay. <SEP> Okay. No. I don't I don't have any kids. I uh my sister has a she just had a baby. He's about five months old. And she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different. Uh-huh. <SEP> Do you have kids? I have three. Oh really? Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I do. Yes. Uh I don't work though. But I used to work and when I had two children. Uh-huh. I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit. But I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care. <SEP> Yeah. But does your sister live in a big community? Uh yeah. She lives. It's a it's a fairly large community. She uh got real lucky though. He had a boss who uh moved into a larger office. Uh-huh. <SEP> And she's able to take her baby to work with her. Oh really? And it's a small office that she works in. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it's a it's a legal firm office. And it's just one lawyer. Um. And so she's the only one really that takes care of the office. There's no one else that works there. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby. So it works out pretty good for her. Wow. How lucky. I I know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids. <SEP> Yeah. And but the community I'm in is not a real large one. So there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that you know. You either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to. Yeah. So it's fairly safe. Yeah. To get references and that. So but uh. I I d- don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because there's so many kids and so many. <SEP> Worried that they're not going to get enough attention? Yeah. And uh you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things. Yeah. But and they're expensive. And course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things. <SEP> Yes. Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that. But. Take a long time to find the right place. Yeah. And you and you don't always even know if it's it's going to be the right place or not. Uh-huh. <SEP> Anything I guess could happen. Uh-huh. Because after I guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care. Uh-huh. When he starts toddling around and stuff. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. When when he's not when she can't keep control of him. And he starts crawling. That's. Uh-huh. It would be hard. I think it would be kind of stressful. It would be nice to have him around. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh seems like you know. Goll-. What if he cried at the wrong time. Or the phone rang or you know at the wrong time. <SEP> Yeah. But. I think she has problems with that too. Uh-huh. Well when you have kids will you work? Do you work now? <SEP> I don't know. That's something I've considered. Uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time. Uh-huh. Is that what you do? Uh yeah. Actually I teach my kids at home. So I'm here all the time. <SEP> Oh so they don't go to school. Is it like uh. Oh what's that called. It's uh correspondence school. They do it at home. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> That's interesting. So. Do you have to have any special training? Not. It depends on the state you live actually. Some laws absolutely prohibit it. Some states uh say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that. Our state doesn't yet say that. And I'm not a certified teacher. I went to college. But I you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now. And so. <SEP> So they haven't been to public schools at all. One of them was for a couple of years. And so you know my oldest he was. And then my youngest two have never been. Um. So anyway. But we don't. <SEP> So you've never had.
