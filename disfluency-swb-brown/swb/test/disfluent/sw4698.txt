Actually I've been involved in electronics a long time. Uh in computers. And I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home. Uh up until I guess maybe about a year and a half ago. Oh yeah. I got one for my son. A a Macintosh uh L C. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's a real easy to use color uh computer. And I got a very nice printer that goes along with it. And he uses it for his school work. Uh-huh. Well I've I'm currently in school. So I I've had an I B M clone I guess for a couple of years now which I've been trying continually upgrading I guess. And uh I've found I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it. And I can't really. I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis. So. Huh. <SEP> It it's pr- very essential for me. Schools have them. Uh but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school. It's very easy it's much more convenient to have one at home. Where you going to school? At Georgia Tech. I see. <SEP> Yeah. So. In engineering? Yes actually. So that explains wha- all the uh computer assignments. <SEP> Yeah. It uh. Well do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work? Um sure. I have some games of course which I play on there. And uh uh I have a program which allows me to access a uh weather data bank. So I can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby. So it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on. So. Have you do you have a computer for yourself at home? No. No. I just have one for my son. And I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. Tha-. At wo- at work uh I'm a technologist uh. And I in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming. Uh but now I find myself using the computer. Even the computer at work is primarily a uh word processing system and a communication system. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Do you use Email and like that? Yes. Emil is probably pulls down a third a- of all my time. <SEP> Yeah. It's. I I uh I have modem night computer. So I can log into the sys- the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful. But uh yeah. That's that and word processing is. While I tend to. I mean obviously I do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. Uh-huh. So it's it's really become I don't know really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember. Actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a a to do a report. Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high. So. Huh. Well I'm a old-timer. I did my Master's thesis on uh a typewriter. Oh yeah. Uh I rented an I B M Selectric. <SEP> Oh. And it was a pretty big deal. Yeah. It must have been tough. It's a little bit strange for me. I I did my Master's thesis uh last year. And I did that on a computer. And it seems like. I just can't imagine how people did it before. It must have been just so much so much work. Yeah. It uh well you know it's just it was just a completely different world then. <SEP> Yeah. So uh so yo- you used your son's Macintosh then? Do you do you find it do you like that kind of computer? I like it. Yeah. I like it from a distance really. I I see the packages on it uh that are available. And it's nice. I really don't use it myself. Uh-huh. Uh I when I come home from work I I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things. <SEP> Yeah. Huh. Uh so I let my son do it. And Uh of course you know there's uh there's an intellectual evolution taking place where. <SEP> Yeah. It's sort of a joke. But it's really true. The old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot. And the kids they just take to it like candy. Yeah. Well i- if if if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge.
