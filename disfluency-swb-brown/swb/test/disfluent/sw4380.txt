Recently graduated from high school. Meaning like uh you know three or four years ago. I'm a senior in in uh college now. Uh-huh. And uh I can't really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system I went to was uh really superb even though it was a public school system. <SEP> Really? Yeah. I feel that my uh. I'm a junior in college now. And I go to Tech Georgia Tech? Oh. Okay. <SEP> Yeah. And I. I got a friend who goes there by the way. I want to as- talk to you about that afterward. Okay. <SEP> Okay. Uh I've. The high school I went to was uh was a good one also. And I well I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. Because the one I went to was you know I'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta. Yeah. Yeah. It was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system? <SEP> Yeah. Yes. That that was true for mine too. Uh although I I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity. But I don't think I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. You know I think that uh I mean I know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education. <SEP> What d-. And uh you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn. Yeah. That's true. I mean you know. <SEP> Yeah. And I'm also. I mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would you know in areas where they. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But but uh I think I mean even more than that even I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know? Which it I mean it sounds like uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. That's true. Now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory -tory tests if you have to take before you get a diploma. <SEP> Right. But uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read. Uh and that's just sort of inexcusable. And you can't really. I I I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know except maybe to someone who's you know really badly learning uh disabled or something. <SEP> Yeah. But these people obviously weren't. That's hard for me to say since I didn't I didn't really grow. <SEP> Well when I went to elementary school it it wasn't in a great area. But I still I mean I learned to read started learning to read when I was in kindergarten you know. Yeah. So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed region. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. You know I guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people. Yeah. And I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably. <SEP> I mean I don't I think you know people just. So I guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to uh to get some kind of motivation to learn. And. Yeah. And again I don't I mean. They got to know the you know how qualified I mean. I think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school. You know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think that'd be an interesting experience. But uh I haven't done that. No. I I can't say that I have either. <SEP> But uh. But I do I do think that uh I mean public education in general I think can work. And I think it's a good thing. Yeah. I've I've heard some I mean I've heard sta- sta- statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like within the same uh income groups. Yeah. <SEP> If you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private schools. Yes. I think they compare fair- you know fairly well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I don't I honestly don't really think I could have you know done much better than I did in the school system I was in. I mean. <SEP> Yeah. I I I my schools I mean there. I have a lot of. Once once it seemed I got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that. Yeah. <SEP> That I mean that makes a big difference. Cause I wondered when they're taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that. Yeah. I mean and and in the. Once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels. Well no. I guess it wa- in junior high it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects. Uh which. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean actually I think that works pretty well. And that that makes.
