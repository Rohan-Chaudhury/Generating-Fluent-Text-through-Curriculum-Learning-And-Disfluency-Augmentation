Do you think that there's any way that uh. Or do you think there's too much crime now? I mean I guess any crime is too much. But It's out of control. <SEP> Uh yeah. Yeah. Uh well uh out of control I don't know. I guess it could be worse. Uh we've uh we've we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood. Uh I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington. Uh there's uh there's a lot of problems. I mean there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people. And uh you know we get c- cars on our block uh regularly uh uh g- uh gone through rifled through and stuff. Really? <SEP> Yeah. I would not of okay I would not have guessed that in Seattle. Yeah. You figured it was like Omaha right? Yeah. <SEP> You know. No. It's uh it's not Newark. But uh yeah. It's got problems. Yeah. I wonder I mean I wonder what what really is the answer. I mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system. <SEP> Yeah. I think most people regard it as a warehouse. Where you put away the people that are so bad that uh you don't want them out in circulation. Yeah. But but the problem is is that we we only have but so much room. And we we try to put aside in the warehouse. And all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes. <SEP> Yeah. And. That's what I hear. So it's uh. <SEP> Yeah. I I think you know. Don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea? I get the feeling that a lot of people have. I'm not convinced that I have. Yeah. Uh see I mean my mom taught English as a second language. And and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes. And uh. <SEP> Oh you mean she taught in a prison? Yes. Oh. In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia. <SEP> I see. Uh. And the problem she had was not with the inmates at all. The the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison. <SEP> I mean It was it was I mean. Yeah. The b- the bureaucracy. They they put her I mean. I didn't obviously I didn't see the classroom uh and hopefully never will. But uh they they put her at the end of a hallway. <SEP> There were no other classes going on at the time. And they refused to let her wear a body al- a body alarm. Which. Uh. And. I don't know exactly what that is. But I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people. <SEP> Yeah. But uh you know. So she didn't feel safe. No. She didn't. She didn't. She she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates. And then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse. And uh she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around. <SEP> Yeah. But well she had decided that it was when we came back to the States she decided that it was too. She didn't feel that public schools were s- were safe. So next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison. Yeah. Right. But uh. <SEP> Well at least it's maximum security right. Yeah. But but the point that was that it you know. You said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible. And and I'm I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it. Uh well I I think the people that run yeah that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical you know. Uh. <SEP> I mean I uh you know I I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff. And it's uh. You can get pretty hardened I'm sure. But getting I mean well see. I always have problems because because I can never decide whether or not I'm I'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal. But. Yeah. Right. But I keep I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is circumstances. <SEP> Those are funny labels see. I mean I can't help but wonder if if I grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison at this point? Oh yeah. <SEP> Oh Oh yeah. Absolutely. I think uh yeah I think you can blame it on social problems. Sure. I mean I don't know. <SEP> I mean as as you know as poverty has gotten worse as you know education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's m- been more crime. We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program. Yeah. There's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse. <SEP> And yep. It's a mess. I don't I don't remember the the gentleman's name. But the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a is a Rhodes Scholar. And what he. Is he the guy wants to like deregulate heroin or something? Well what he wants to do is take all the money that uh he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education. <SEP> Uh-huh. And basically just just attack the problem at the demand side. Uh-huh. Stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't. I mean Switzerland tried the the grand experiment. And you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park. And.
