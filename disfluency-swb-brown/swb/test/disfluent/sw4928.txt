Well my exercise program consists of uh you know. It's it's a opportunity to stay alive really. Instead of you know wasting my my the you know the trying to exist on the latency of my youth the good health of my youth. Huh. I'm. And what I like to do is I like to stretch out. And I like to run uh m-. I'm I like to run get my heartbeat up. I like to run about oh about two two and a half miles. And then I like to work out on uh on the uh the Bailey Life C- Cycle machines up here at the at the Holiday Spa. And and I I think that you know. I've had a regiment now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that. And uh and I I kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work. But I think it's uh it's a lot of work. But I think it's uh it's the uh the amount of effort that's required to uh to stay healthy you know. I have a sedentary job. And uh unless you do something like that y- you're going to get sick. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I'm I need to get. I'm I'm pretty bad about that. I'm lazy. I should I know. I want I always say that I need to get run- start running. And I'm going to try and do that this summer. Because I never have time. I I always put it off. By the time I get back from classes it's late at night. And I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever. Because I'm I'm getting a gut here. I got to get back into shape. Well I uh two years ago I started having trouble with my knee. And uh you know I've got you know. I figured well it'll go away. Well I s- you know I'm I've had to reduce my program reduce my program. And I've gained fifteen pounds. Huh. And so uh you know it's e- you know. I need to get back into swimming you know instead of running. If I can't swim or I can't run I should be able to swim. Well I'm such a terrible swimmer. And I I I really feel I can I can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes f- to this effort. But if it gets longer than that I I i- it I start not doing anything. <SEP> Yeah. And so so I got a real problem in that regard. Uh it. Do. You obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it. Yeah. I mean I do it I guess. I'm going to do it uh because I want to get in shape. I'm not it's not something I really enjoy all that much that I'll I'll probably. I mean once I get into it and I if I if I get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a a chore to me. Well it's it's always a chore. I mean I started doing this when I was about thirty-five. <SEP> Yeah. Huh. And now I'm fifty-five. <SEP> Yeah. And uh you know I I know that in I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense. Y- you know some health related thing is going to blow me away. That's the same way. I got too much weight on right now. I need to lose fifty pounds you know. Right. I need to lose at least twenty you know. But uh you know it's it's just uh I'm busy. I'm doing a lot of traveling. And uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road. What sort of uh uh what other programs other than say running? Have you have you ever done anything at all? <SEP> Yeah. I have. Uh sit-ups. Or al- also last summer I was doing Nautilus. Or last year I'm uh belong to a club right here. Got kind of expensive uh to r- to r- renew. They wanted another fifty dollars. Uh-huh. That was a little bit too much money. But uh doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that. Club what club are you with? <SEP> I'm sorry? What club were you with? It's called oh what was it called. City Sports downtown Washington. Oh. Okay. So you're you're down you're downtown. <SEP> Yeah. I'm at I'm at I go to George Washington University. Okay. Yeah. You're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and F G. Yeah. <SEP> It's uh Plaza. Oh. Well I'd uh. Well there's a there's a Holiday Spa down there on on K street I think. Something like that. But uh I I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria. And that's pretty good. But you know evening time it gets pretty busy. But generally you know I can I can get in and get a program you know. Right. But uh you know I I need to I need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this. And uh I got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it. I mean I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years. <SEP> Yeah. And you know and I'm I know I'm going to get I know it's going to bite me in the ass. And so I I really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it. Yeah. It's something. I think uh I'm young. I should get started getting into shape. I don't want to. I want. I mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it. Well no. When you're young you you can abuse your your all your systems. <SEP> And you can recover. Yeah. Uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away. And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye you know. <SEP> Huh. And uh and so the object.
