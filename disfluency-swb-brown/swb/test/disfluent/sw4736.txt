Capital punishment uh I guess out in California is has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper. Uh apparently you know there's they haven't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe. Uh yeah. That's that's as far back as I can remember. Well that's before my time actually. Yeah. They. <SEP> Well I we were we uh we just started we lived in Redwood City when we were out there. Uh-huh. And uh and we found that uh you know it was a very liberal kind of community. But the uh I I really feel that that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars. And then they they uh uh you know lawyers these lawyer groups get together. And they uh they I think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process. Uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years. Uh and I I think that uh that there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that. I think capital punishment uh uh was or probably stringent enough. But I think the appeal process is really getting in the way. <SEP> Uh-huh. Do do you feel as though there should be uh more uh was or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment? Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not. It's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself. It's at that point where they're saying like here you're you're going on death row. But you'll stay there for twenty years. Uh-huh. <SEP> And nothing is being done about it. Uh the laws exist and are frequently upheld in in uh in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find. And it's it's really getting out of hand in many states. Well the term technicality. The law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous acts are done to uh to you know to get somebody into a a situation where they're going to be guilty of of a crime. <SEP> Or whether uh an- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impuned. Uh but or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a uh a you know a non a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it. But but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker as being supportive. Now I I'm a- a- at this juncture. I you know I'm I'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality. You know that that's what all c- these these hearings are about. And that's what all these you know court cases are about. I mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of out of the can. And uh you know he he tried to appeal his conviction. Uh. And you know it didn't work. But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry. Uh in in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of Hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody. And he you were his slave. And if he didn't like what you did he killed you. <SEP> And that has that's pretty effective. Uh you know it's not good for civil rights I guess. But it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community. And if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods. So I I I mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh imaginations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in so- in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing. Well it seems like well it it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished. And the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off. Um for instance um there's a case a few years back where uh someone uh someone who's being convicted for was under a tri- was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that. The of- the arresting officer uh did not read the defendant their rights. Uh-huh. <SEP> And where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet.
