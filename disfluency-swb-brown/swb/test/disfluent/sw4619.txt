Bye. So we're uh our discussion's about uh the care of the elderly? That's right. That's right. You know what what uh what do you think is important? If you were. Uh I don't know how how old you are. But if you had if you had uh parents say or or or th- grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for? <SEP> Uh well I actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety. And he lives by himself. Huh. And he's in good shape. <SEP> Yeah. Uh but uh some friends of mine have uh gone through this. I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and uh where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive. And where there was uh caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it. Yeah. Do you have any experience with this yourself? <SEP> Huh. Well my uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh Minnesota. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we go there uh once a year. We see we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston. So we're pretty far away. When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her. Uh-huh. And it seems uh. I mean the the environment there I don't know too much about it. But it it seems nice enough. Uh it it's hard. At least half of the residents I would say are not not mentally sound. So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r- to retain uh clarity say uh you know. From the lack of stimulation you mean. <SEP> Yeah. Well I I don- I don't know. We we also my wife and I uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house. We uh she goes more often than I. We used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there. And we'd take we have a two year old son. And so we sometimes we'd take him with us. And uh there I would say it's the same thing. It's it's a nice uh relatively nice environment. But again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just e- e- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly uh certainly have ar- ar- are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on. It's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see an- and see all these other people who really don't know where they are. Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern? I think yeah. I think they're relatively re- respectful. Yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be. I I think sometimes you know I've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and but things that are not reasonable. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so at some level the the the uh. Yeah. I'm sure that the that the uh the staff l- learn what's normal for this person. And so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know. Yeah. It it's possible. I was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you one thing though that'll that that I I saw that was really nice. We saw a husband and wife. We used to see a husband and wife in there uh together. And they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were. But these two were. Uh-huh. <SEP> And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house. Uh-huh. So it gives them a sense of identity. And so. <SEP> Yeah. You walked in there. And it didn't look like uh you know how yo- you you walk into some rooms. And there's it's completely generic. There's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person. And that's it. But this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that. And they had all their stuff from their house. And it looked like uh i- i- it must have been. It was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them. And it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know s- s- uh. Yeah. I I think part of what you're saying matches what I h- have read. I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who uh were adequately deficient in their abilities uh physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves. Yeah. But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide um a lot of social activities. <SEP> Huh. Yeah. Uh the one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities. And she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation. Uh and. Huh. Temporary. I. That that's that's new to me. I. Well I think it I think t- it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there. And I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there. <SEP> Right. Right. And there there's so much.
