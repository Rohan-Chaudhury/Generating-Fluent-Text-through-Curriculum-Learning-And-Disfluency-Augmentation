Okay. Okay. You go first. Well I have uh two kids. I have one seven and one five. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh they're in a public school here in Tyler. And uh I'm happy with it. Uh-huh. I'm happy with the school. It's great. Good teachers. Good curriculum uh. They learn a lot. They have no problems uh. But I do live in the better well in the best part of the city. Though I live in you know the real richy part I guess. I'm not. <SEP> But everybody around me is. And uh but they're. I have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town. And their schools are kind of rundown and uh older. And they don't really offer as much I don't know as uh the school that my girls are in. I don't really think that's fair. You know. Uh-huh. Uh but you know I'm happy with what they're in. So go ahead. <SEP> Well yeah. It it's it's pretty much what I was s- going to say. Is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in. Uh-huh. Uh I grew up in New York. And uh the place. Wow. <SEP> Or not New York City upstate New York. Uh-huh. And I went to uh the City of Rochester School District. Uh-huh. <SEP> And s- a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs. And it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other. But the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial. Uh-huh. And uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system. Right. <SEP> And that would result in some uh could result in more equitable distribution of money. Because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs. And the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with. Uh-huh. As a result the schools were rundown. There wasn't as many you know of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked. There wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when I was a senior that some other schools had. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it it. So I you know I think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people. And the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools. Yeah. Right. <SEP> So you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of. Also uh the the family environment. You know you can come to south Tyler where I live. And you have got room mothers in every room. You've got art mothers. You've got every every holiday. There's parties. All these kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something. Yeah. You can go to north Tyler to the schools. And the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. You know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh that has a a whole lot to do with it you know. As far as their learning I mean if the parents aren't uh you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know they really don't have much of a chance at all. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Why is that? Huh? <SEP> Why is that? Why you asking. You j- they just don't. I mean I mean I'm I'm up there at my kids' school. I know what they're learning. And if they're up I call and find out you know. Is she having problems. Does she need help with anything. No. She's doing fine. Okay you know uh. And I I know kids that their parents could really give a rip. And the kids are not motivated. <SEP> Right. Right. They have no motivation from home. So they just go to school. And you know eh you know I'll get through the day and uh bring homework home. And there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this. <SEP> Right. Uh just you know they they take a notion to do it. They do. And uh that doesn't work either you know. They have to have guidance. And uh they can't just have it at school and then come home. Uh-huh. And there's nothing you know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that that that was a big factor for me. I ended up coming out of of the public school system very well and was very good education uh. Uh-huh. Ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I think the difference for me was that my parents were you know they were definitely they were always there. Yeah. Was like well. Yeah. Of course you're going to study and do well. And that's the way. Of course are you.
