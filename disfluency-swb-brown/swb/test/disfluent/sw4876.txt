Well I haven't had an awful lot of uh incidents regarding child care. When my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek. And uh but uh that's about the the uh the extent of it. But but but when. I really am a- am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I and I and I'm saying to myself well you know y- you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place. And they don't pay very much. And w- why why would they be interested in in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know. Uh-huh. And uh that's a terrible kind of thing. And I don't think my children have ever been subject to that. But my wife didn't work. And so we really didn't have that much exposure to it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well I am a working mother. I have three children. And my children since I uh since they were very young. I've had various um different alternatives child care arrangements. And like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel uh in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home. And my kids I think are very very secure well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities. Huh. So I I I e-. You know it is a problem. And but as you pointed out I I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities. And that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford. When our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful. Huh. <SEP> And then as they got older they went to uh I preferred to call them schools. And they were really all day preschools. And they were wonderful. And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things. Oh well that's interesting. But we did we really truly did pay a fortune. I mean we were paying at one point well about about a close about five hundred dollars a week for two children. Oh my God. <SEP> So. Well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that. Well I mus-. I'm a physician. Uh and as is my husband. Oh well yeah. <SEP> And and I felt uh very good about working. I'm a pediatrician actually. Uh-huh. So uh but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children. But and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think. Well not not all of us. You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for. <SEP> I'm an engineer. Oh. Well. And. <SEP> I think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. And we had a really wonderful arrangement uh. I'm with the university actually. Uh-huh. And they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three. And it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. And so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. And they had wonderful. They had things like gardens and lots of pets. And just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio. Yeah. <SEP> So that that sort of an. Most of the teachers had degrees. Uh. Five hundred dollars a week. For two kids. Yeah. That's incredible. <SEP> It was incredible actually. Oh oh. But it was good. I mean it was it. At that time there were two children. And they were in special programs. And each one was a little over two hundred a week. And then in addition I paid a little bit extra. But the kids were. Well. <SEP> I mean they really had some great opportunities. But tha-. W-. What you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage an- and and really have t- feel they have to put their children. Yeah. <SEP> Sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying sit- situations. You know. They could. Somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare. And you know that's a good starting wage. <SEP> Uh-huh. But boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care. Uh-huh. <SEP> No. Even that that really I think I don't. It's been awhile since I've looked at. My youngest child is eight. So it's been a little while since I've looked into actually daycare centers. But they are. Huh. You know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since. I mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit. But mi- mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven. So you know that. <SEP> Uh-huh. I guess baby-sitters now are up at what five dollars an hour? Something like that. Oh my. <SEP> Well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children. I mean it has been a real uh. Th- there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences. And I think I think they have captured a certain market. Again the. But then there are baby-sitting groups. As a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections. Uh-huh. As you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around. Oh yeah.
