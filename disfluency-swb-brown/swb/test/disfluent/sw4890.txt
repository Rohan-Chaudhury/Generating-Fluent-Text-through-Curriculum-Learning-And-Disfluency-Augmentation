Uh with regard to uh to jury trials. I you know I I really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated n- body of law. And if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I I really don't think it they can really do much of anything to change it. What do you think? <SEP> Uh I I don't think so. Possibly in the jury selection would be the only. Just for example what we're seeing in California I guess. It makes you wonder uh had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome. Uh and th- and the problems that that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating. Uh just makes you wonder I guess whether or not they. Well won't. Well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that. But then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know the other two guys sat in the car. That's that's bad. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they didn't get beat up. You know. No. It. Rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh uh just like the burning and looting is self-destruct. Uh-huh. Everybody says well this is the nineties. <SEP> Oh yes. And they're going to rebuild. And it'll be even better. Hey what do you think. You know some some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area? That's right. With everybody with that mind set. They they're they're going to that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto you know. <SEP> They're only going to suffer. And you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know. T- they're only going to suffer. They they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence. Uh I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape. And uh. Well e- everybody is saying this is going to be a new era. And we're going to reexamine this thing. Hey the b- the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed. They're a bunch of animals you know. How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything. Forty deaths. I mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that. <SEP> I know. Yeah. It's really ridiculous. And I'm just trying to determine you know how you address how you weigh you know Rodney getting getting the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths. <SEP> Against forty other people being. Yeah. And there's no other. I'm not su- exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths. And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing. Those deaths. <SEP> Uh-huh. Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner? I you know. No tears. Or just a by- an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what. Yeah. And and so I but I I suspect a number of them. <SEP> Um. You know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street. <SEP> Or or beaten. And and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before rather than stop. And uh and there there would have been just nothing but carnage after after after if I'd been at the wheel. Um. No one would have stopped me. <SEP> Right. That's that's exactly how I feel too. I wouldn't have uh they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had I seen them coming. But I was just wondering since you're you're in you're back east uh and a little closer to the the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here. Right. I'm inside the beltway. <SEP> Oh. You know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus. And so and I say well wait a minute. I'm inside the beltway. And I don't think like that. Uh-huh. I'm a government employee. <SEP> Oh. In what uh section of the government do you work? I'm with the F B I. Oh. Oh that's interesting. Yes. An- and so uh uh and and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick who's another government employee wanted a spe- segments of my speech that that were done a year ago. <SEP> <SEP> Uh-huh. And he wanted another collection a year later. Oh. And so this is my seventh call. A year ago I did eleven calls. <SEP> Oh I see. And so that's that's why uh uh that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique you know I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate.
