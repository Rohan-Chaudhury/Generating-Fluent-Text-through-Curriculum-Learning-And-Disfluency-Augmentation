Okay. So I guess it starts recording now. Okay. Okay. I don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in. We live in the Saginaw area. <SEP> Saginaw? Uh-huh. And I'm not real familiar with uh anything that. I. Fact as far as I know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. And uh or the grocery store or anything in this area. Really? Yeah. <SEP> The rec-. We live in Plano. And they started off recycling by uh putting the. I think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now. I guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans. And uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now. And you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum. Uh-huh. And you set it out. And they pick it up. And it it works real neat. They seem to be having a real good response. Really? <SEP> So. That is pretty good. I'm we're originally from another state. And I know in the state we were from that they did that t- similar type thing. The city brought ought you know set tr- separate trash cans. And you separated your stuff. And you put it in there. And they took it you know. Did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for for cans. I don't really know. <SEP> Even or. I don't really know. They they started after we moved down here. And so I I'm not really familiar. Yeah. I just know that uh my in-laws up in up in Oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up. But I don't know if they get a get anything back on it. Or do you get money for it? <SEP> No. I just I noticed it. Iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can. Oh. So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles. Really. <SEP> You know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to I guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in. Right. <SEP> I n- I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel. Right. And now now most of them are throwaway. Right. <SEP> So maybe that's one thing they can do. I think now they're a lot more expensive than that. Uh I bought some Cokes the other day in the br- the little bottles you know. Uh-huh. And I think the bottles were like I know they were at least ten cents apiece. I started to see at home. I was like God how much were those bottles you know? <SEP> Yes. And it was they come in like uh eight and and eight and ten packs you know instead of six packs. Right. And uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles. You know I was like God Almighty. It costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes. <SEP> That was my brother's first job in a grocery store. He was in the bottle area. In the bot-. It's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over. But but it's uh it's quite. Right. <SEP> They say that the green glass now that there's a big glut of green the green glass. Oh really? Of green glass. <SEP> Yeah. It's amazing. Well out in this area they really don't have anything. Now I know that like Minyard's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front. Uh different colors for different things and and things like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But I I do know some of these places were doing that. And they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them. Right. <SEP> Yeah. It's. I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs. Yeah. It it's. People just. They they really don't. Uh there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff. Yeah. More than it's worth. <SEP> It's. I don't know. It it can be. It's not as easy selecting you know clean junk as they say. Right. Well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away. <SEP> That's right. That's right. It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. Right. Uh yeah. We all do it. <SEP> Well it was nice talking to you. It was nice talking to you. I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything. Oh I think I think two or three minutes is fine. I-. <SEP> Is that it? Yeah. Okay. Well it was nice talking to you. And I I guess I'll do this for I was doing this for actually I was going to do it for my son so that he could uh he he's in high school so that he could make some money. <SEP> Right. Uh but then it has my name on it. So I'm like okay. I'll sit down here and call it. Well we're doing it for a church choir. So. Oh are you? <SEP> Yeah. Oh that's interesting. So. That's nice. Well. <SEP> Well thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.
