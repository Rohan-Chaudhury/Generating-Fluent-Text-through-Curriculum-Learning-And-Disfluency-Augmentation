Okay. What is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling? Uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup. Uh-huh. Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts. Some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect. And they do have bins set up. But I live in a a metropolitan area. And uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that. <SEP> Well here they and. Uh live in an apartment complex. Uh-huh. And they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins. I I know a lot I think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort. Whether. And and I think that and I know Massachusetts has. A bottle bill was passed. And we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now. And the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh. That's the majority of people that I know of anyways. Where people aren't really you know eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do. And I'm not going to throw a bottle away. It's like throwing a nickel away. That type of thing. <SEP> Right. They Th- here they're trying to push through a bill. But uh people need to be more conscious of it. And a lot of people are against it. And it's going to create a lot more work for the uh the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff. Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything. Yeah. It didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. Uh and and matter of fact I think it took like three tries t- for it to go through. But and it's been pretty successful. And people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know. People would dr- have a drink of soda. Instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle. So it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth. But more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing. And that's the big thing I think that th- they try to promote. <SEP> Right. I think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate. Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. <SEP> Th- there definitely has to be a motivation factor. And I know that at w- where I work. I work for a defense contractor. And there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh Styrofoam usage because of the uh the process involved in Styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that. And and they're very proactive. And uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh Styrofoam stuff. So. So i- i- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it. I think that's that's what they need to do. Be more proactive like that. Uh I know uh I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books. Uh usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones. Usually just get dumped out with the trash. And phone books are a large volume of annual trash. Yeah. They they just. Matter of fact that that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa-. The local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school. And what they'll do is they'll recycle it. Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time. A guy went to a d- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty. Because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time. <SEP> Well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper. Yeah. They contain the glue and stuff. And they used to have to take out all the uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them. Yeah. <SEP> Now I think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out. Yeah. Okay.
