Why don't you start? Oh I don't know. I uh I refinished a couple of old uh dressers that were gi- handed down. You know nice it's nice tongue and groove uh uh construction. Uh that's been I've been pretty successful with that. Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that? <SEP> What? Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing? No. I've done some other things too. Uh you know. Yeah. I've done both. <SEP> Yeah. Uh uh my wife has picked up a couple of things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture. And uh we've done it a couple of times. I guess that we've been fairly successful with those. Oh yeah. That's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it I guess. <SEP> Yeah. That's a good way to get started. Uh I have a a uh really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire. Uh-huh. And uh we stripped it all the way down and refinished it. And it turned out to be really nice uh a nice desk. Maple top I think or or something of that sort. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I I uh put together a a up rolltop desk from scratch. Oh really? You know a kit. Oh. I'm jealous. <SEP> Yeah. Still had to cut it and everything. But it was fun. Uh-huh. Yeah. I I do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking. I've built my own deck and uh things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I I've done the same. You know like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that. And uh I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too. <SEP> My I uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive. Uh-huh. And so I do have a band saw and a router and uh things like that out in the garage. But I can't say I use them very often. <SEP> Um. Yeah. I'm looking at trying to get a router right now. They're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times. Putting doors in is the time when I'm. Uh I bought myself a uh template for making mortices and doors. And that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel. <SEP> I'll bet. But I've also I've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain. Uh-huh. So I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it. And now I use it twice a year maybe. <SEP> Yeah. My br- my brother's used it a lot for making drawers. I don't know. The big. What what's your opinion of wha- what a good router is like? You know I. Uh I guess it. <SEP> Because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great. They've plastic parts and stuff. The ones that what? That you dial in on the side. Uh I have never even s- I have never even looked at one closely. Uh the the little use that I've gotten from my router I would say uh I would spend my money on the bits. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh I have a I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router. And the uh. <SEP> How strong is it? It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time. But the problem is that the uh as with. Any any time you buy a a tool with a a as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end. Don't they. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> So the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably uh I mean a a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars. And uh uh if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it. Because y- e- uh. I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself uh they won't last. And I've never had the bits sharpened. So. That's a thing to consider is to. Uh-huh. <SEP> They they really get hot don't they? Yeah. And they they dull after awhile. Especially I did some cabinets in uh ash and oak. Uh-huh. And uh that that wears a bit down. We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth. And uh routing hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast. So. <SEP> Yeah. I've cut some one by eight oak before. Boy was that fun. Right. That's uh. Big solid pieces of oak are just tough. And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right. <SEP> Well that was you know with a with a circular saw. Uh-huh. <SEP> Like oh my gosh. Right. Is this going to be fun? Yeah. Well I've used mine on treated wood. And now all my blades need sharpening. Because uh treated wood will also chew them up. <SEP> Yeah. Treated wood can really make you sick too.
