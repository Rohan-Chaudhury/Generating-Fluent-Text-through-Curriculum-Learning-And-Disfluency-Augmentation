Have you had that experience recently? Recently I can't really say recently. But I think about uh about a year ago uh I bought a product from some company down at uh in Atlanta Georgia. I believe it was one of these uh one of these uh mixers. These like these juice machines. And uh the uh the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay. Oh yeah. <SEP> But I found that uh it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh after. Oh. Even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about uh three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because i- I you know I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it. But uh it was really uh it was. I had to send it back after like you know the third week because I realized it was like it was not. Something was very very wrong with the blade. Uh what about you? Well I don't have so much trouble with products as service. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't feel like that's as big a problem. I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly. Uh-huh. And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh the one I have now is okay most of the time. Uh-huh. But that's it. But that's that's probably the worst. My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. Uh James Avery. I don't know if you have that up there. But it it's a very good company. That sells sterling silver things. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the catch broke. And she was sitting in school on a carpet. And when she stood up it caught and broke. And we took it back. And they said oh this was just obviously yanked. Uh-huh. This was yanked. I mean they were so rude about it. <SEP> Right. And so we wanted a different kind of catch. And she said well it's not guaranteed. And I said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed. So do it anyway. Uh-huh. So we got the kind we wanted. And I was really disappointed with that. I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends. And I called there to see if they had it. And the lady was very nice. And I said my goodness. I said you've been very nice what's your name. And she told me. And I said well I really appreciate it. I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store. And it turned out she was the assistant manager. So. <SEP> Well at least you're talking to somebody who counts. Right. So I felt kind of good about that you know. I didn't even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But I just felt like well at least I did something. Maybe they'll fix it. They might work on that you know. Right. Right. But I find attitudes are more of a problem. Service is more of a problem. <SEP> I find. Up here in the northeast we have uh well w- we have these mail order companies like L L Bean. And uh they are famous for I guess having really top-notch service. They've got uh. Really. I mean I've I've I I have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half. And even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition. And they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore. Uh they'll they'll actually do things like this. I mean they're really they they go- bend over backwards service wise for you. I've uh I've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call. That's really great. <SEP> I guess if if you call the e- any eight hundred number uh if you you can call up e- any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get uh the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies. And um actually I've tried that with a few companies lately. And they've most of them have been pretty good. But I I was. One reason why I like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through Bean or though. Uh I guess Bean's one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in uh I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere. They they are uh they're very good about uh insur-. Huh. Like the customer is always right. And you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding. And uh they usually get you know they they make things are they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise. That's really good. It use to be like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. But. I don't think most places are like that anymore. <SEP> Yeah. Well I think I guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is I guess. There was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are uh you know. Things are getting rough out there. There's a lot of you know. The morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know.
