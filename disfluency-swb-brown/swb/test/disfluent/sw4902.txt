And you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue? Uh yes. I do as far as uh as far as uh as far as immigration as a whole goes. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world. Uh-huh. Uh I. There just is not going to be room for all of us. We don't have jobs now. I I think uh I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time. Uh I hope you're one of the employed right now. Uh-huh. <SEP> I am one of the unemployed right now. I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company. And uh I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings. But they had two thousand applications. Yeah. <SEP> And I know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you know doing my line of work. Uh-huh. And of course I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job. Right. <SEP> So how do you feel? Well I'm a little bit ambivalent. The problem with uh and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in in terms of what uh really is driving it. They're not willing to tell the truth. The same way with uh issues of uh race and things like that. I mean right now uh I believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration. Three actually. One is at the high end uh. They always want to be able to uh do some brain draining. They always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou. Or you know. Right. They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field. And so they can almost always find room for someone like that. At the bottom end they uh are always willing to uh let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area. <SEP> Those are two things that I think are going on. Although they I I don't think the politicians would tell you that. <SEP> Okay. And I think you're right in both cases. And then the third thing is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico. They can not close off the Mexican border. Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country. <SEP> So they keep allowing uh the pressure cooker to let off steam. And I think probably it's pretty important right there. How do you feel about Haitian immigration? Uh that's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan. I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into uh society. They're very difficult uh group to find jobs and uh and uh places for. And so uh uh I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are. But I'm not to sympathetic about uh letting large numbers of Haitians in. <SEP> Actually actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here. Yeah. And it would have nothing to do with political situations. It would have to do with poverty. Right. But if you let them yeah. If you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population. But po- politically and economically. <SEP> Oh my gosh. Have you been have you been to southern Florida? Yeah. Well I know about it. Uh I mean it's it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago. <SEP> Well I mean and the two of them together. I mean we can. It's just as well you know. It's hardly America anymore. On the other hand you know the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant. So there's uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in. But there's some differences in the immigrants that that we're getting now. <SEP> Well I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration. Right. Sure. <SEP> I think probably your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals. Right. <SEP> But uh the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into America. Uh they they don't bother to learn our language. And uh first of all th- they. I'm sorry this I really feel strongly about this. Uh-huh. <SEP> We send a lot of money to Mexico. Uh-huh.
