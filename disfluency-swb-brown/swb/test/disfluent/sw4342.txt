So how do you uh. So so it sounds like you've got a television going on there. So I can assume that you probably watch the T V news. Is that. I almost never watch T V news. Really? <SEP> Wow. I. I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio. Uh what what station do you listen to? <SEP> Uh it's a local radio station. It's called uh K L I F cliff. Cliff I see. So uh it's not affiliated with anything is it. Not it's not a network station. No. <SEP> No. Okay. Yeah. Because I I listen to uh public radio a lot. And they have they have K C R W which I I I saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet I guess. They're getting a little getting a little feisty now. Well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news. Uh. <SEP> And occasionally in the morning I'll pick up something like uh C N N or that. But I hate watching the like ten o'clock news. Or. Yeah. So you have a paper or something or. Yeah. We have a lo- well we have uh DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas. Uh-huh. <SEP> We read I read it pretty much from cover to cover. Yeah. How do you like it? It's been it's been a while since I read the Dallas news. I uh fact last time I read the Dallas Dallas news I was in Arkansas. <SEP> I uh. The TIMES HERALD went out of business here. Oh yeah? <SEP> And so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper. Well that must be pretty bad. So how did that happen anyway? <SEP> Uh financial trouble. No. Not how. I mean when did it when did they. Oh when did it happen? Yeah. <SEP> I guess they closed down about three months ago. Oh really. Um. <SEP> So how do you keep up? Oh me I uh good grief I read the TIMES LOS ANGELES TIMES. There's quite a task if you've ever run into one. They're uh speci-. Yes they're very voluminous. <SEP> Yeah. They're thick. Uh if there's something you want to know it's it's in the TIMES and then and in detail. Uh they uh we we used to have two papers here in town. And then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of oh I don't know just nobody was buying it really. <SEP> So there really is only one major L A now? Yeah. Pretty much. Uh there used to be fact I think there still is the uh the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley. And uh they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes. In fact it was kind of weird because I met the uh I met the I met the editor uh while I was on uh while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time. It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff. He was a really cool guy. Uh you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff. And uh it's it's a pretty good paper. But uh you know it's not it's not the TIMES. <SEP> Yeah. Although I you know I'm sorry to see some of their uh. There's there's a daily news uh news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're they're expanding I guess. But uh a- and occasionally I I pick up like TIME magazine or something I think uh if they've got an interesting lead story. But you know it's. I I don't have time. I used to read TIME magazine a lot. But I don't read it much anymore. Yeah. That's that's kind of a problem for them. There's a lot of people who fall into that category. <SEP> And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community. Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. Uh-huh. <SEP> I see. Yeah. The big dailies don't like to don't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf. I have to admit the TIMES is kind of provincial too. It's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover. <SEP> Now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section. Uh-huh. And it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano. But it's still not an awful lot of news. Yeah. I know. I uh it was it was a big discovery when when the TIMES when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County. <SEP> I mean the way they I mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border. Oh I would imagine in uh you know in in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the sub- suburbs. And of course they tend to cover the county. And we're not in Dallas county. So they tend to ignore places outside of the county. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I I I find that attitude kind of arrogant though. It's like you're taking our money. But you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us. Yeah.
