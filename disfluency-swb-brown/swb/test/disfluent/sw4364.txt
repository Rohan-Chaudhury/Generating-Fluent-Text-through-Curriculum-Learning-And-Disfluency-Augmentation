So do you your privacy being invaded at any time? Well uh one of the things that uh that I found to be uh an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the on the uh credit card bill. That is something that is not required. Well yo-. <SEP> Right. And in fact uh it is actually prohibited. But it doesn't stop many people many people from uh from doing it. And it's n- o- one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic uh research. And to get th- your your phone number on uh uh lists for phone solicitations. Yeah. Yeah. Now th- that y- s- you can still yeah. I've always done that. I started. Once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse. And I say what are you going to do. You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all. And then ultimately they say no. You don't have to put it down. But uh really it's part of this compliance thing. Uh-huh. Uh the thing I don't like. I know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles. <SEP> Uh-huh. That really burns me because hey you're required. You have to do that. Right. And nowhere does it say you h- asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I think that it it's one thing f- to uh voluntarily give it because someone asks. You can always refuse. But it's another thing where it's required by law. And then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. You know. Right. Uh That. I don't think I don't think they have the right to do that. <SEP> I agree with you there. That's something that uh people have seen. Oh here's an easy way to make some money. But uh I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not. I I've heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state. Uh the budget problems up here are are pretty tense. And people are looking for alternate ways of uh. En- enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use. And they were talking about selling the D M V lists. And there was a lot of uh a lot of uh consternation about that. And the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea. But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made uh public that you don't know about. <SEP> Well that's easy. Whenever you donate money to someone? Uh-huh. They you become put on something like a sucker list. And you start getting millions of calls or solicitations. <SEP> Right. And then you s- y- y-. It kind of makes you feel from doing it again. Uh-huh. Like uh National Public Radio or any of these the public uh stations you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. I I I I think I sent in in money for f- once to uh to public uh T V. Uh-huh. And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine. <SEP> Huh. I. It's like. And it just started soon after I had done that one. Right. And I just said this is this is terrible. Uh and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh it's one thing. They don't sell the list. But the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people. Th- the people do these phonathons. Right. And they call you up. And they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that. And and they say oh we we know you. You uh had uh contributed x amount last year. Can you do better this year? And you know like hold on here. <SEP> How do you know that? Who how do you know that? Why why you even telling me this? Is it any of your business? I mean it's one thing that I and the college knows that. That's just our business. There's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all. <SEP> Uh-huh. Just uh. And that was very offensive too. I. And so. Last year the uh Lotus Development Company the uh company that puts out One Two Three was planning on marketing a uh C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right.
