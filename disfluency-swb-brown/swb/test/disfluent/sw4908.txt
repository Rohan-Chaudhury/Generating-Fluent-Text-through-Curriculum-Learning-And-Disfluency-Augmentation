Uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers. And we keep the newspapers in a in a. They're collected twice a month and the trash and and this bottled stuff that is put in a in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck. So they ma- actually have about three passes at this collection. One for the regular trash one for the uh uh you know the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers. Sounds. <SEP> But I gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans. No. They they do that on the truck. Uh-huh. <SEP> They separate them as they as they you know dump them. And you know one guy comes around with his truck and and dumps it all in there. And I think they're they're running out of uh you know. The sanitary landfill I think uh is you know running out. Of course uh you being from New Mexico you've probably been n- to Washington. Especially if you're your present location. Yes. You must have come to Washington at least once. Yes. I know. Not only have I come to Washington but uh I find it very amusing that uh the thing that was just instituted here is very similar. That is we also have blue bins. We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and uh landfill space is in deed the driving factor here. And in fact uh despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still uh very hard to come by. <SEP> My you've got a lot a a lot of nothing out there. You know. A-. They got. I mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could you could use for landfill. Ah. But if somebody can make a regulation about it they will. <SEP> Well what other we- we- what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what in Los Alamos? Well uh. Uh other other than nuking it. Yes. Other than nuking it. <SEP> Um in fact Los Alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general. Um it it involves for instance uh creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general. And uh and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements. Well isn't that a that's a that's pretty uh upscale uh trash uh uh situation. I don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals. <SEP> And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has uh ter- made some special uh polymers that have the ability to uh make certain actinide elements adhere to them. Uh uh they've uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste. <SEP> Huh. And again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh E S and H uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about I think much more than they should. Actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable. We-. Back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the uh paper from the computer center. And uh in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable pa- recycled paper. <SEP> Huh. Well that's certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things. I I think it should be i- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy. You y- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know. Uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound. I I think I think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff. I think that's a wonderful idea. <SEP> The only alternative I would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain. Uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill. Uh-huh. And it would also cause people to compact their garbage more. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight. <SEP> Well of course that uh you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor.
