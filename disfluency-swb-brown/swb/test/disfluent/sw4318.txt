Before the one will take. Uh okay. Let's see. I guess uh I can start. I'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing. Are you really? Yeah. Uh so I'm looking at uh something larger than what we have. We've got like an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty-nine Horizon. So I'm looking for something uh littler bigger. <SEP> Uh-huh. Which are both kind of small. Yeah. Uh so we were thinking mini van for a while. And uh we're looking at uh some just four door five passenger sedans as well. Uh-huh. <SEP> Are you looking for an American car. Or you open to buying foreign cars? Uh I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know. Uh-huh. It's you know it. I guess the American cars had a bad reputation. But I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Personally I have a Japanese car right now. And I really like it a lot. Uh I think the Japanese really build good cars. Uh-huh. And I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now. But I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while. Yeah. <SEP> If I were to buy another car I would be uh I would be partial to buying another Japanese car. But I would also look at American cars. But when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also. And I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product. Yeah. I mean e- even if it's just details it seems like uh they you know. So if I were. <SEP> Right. I j-. There's a door seal that s- doesn't quite seal. And you have to take it back every once in a while. It's clearly just a a design problem there. Right. It is. Uh I'm kind of. Right now. The next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car. I would really like to have a sports car. Uh I don't really I don't have a family. So I don't need a a mini van or such to uh haul people around in. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh. Oh like a Miata or something like that? Well I like the Miata. But I don't like it enough to buy it. I would buy something. Actually the the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car. Um. <SEP> But uh something along that lines. Interesting. Uh because I have a an economy car right now which is okay. But uh I think I I'd like to move on to something a little better. Yeah. <SEP> That's interesting. Yeah. I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for you know size and safety and then mileage. Right. Probably. <SEP> Right. Uh. That's. When I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage. And I was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was g- that I would get a for the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was that was worth that money. Yeah. <SEP> So. Yeah. I c- I think in terms of computer terminology I look at you know price performance and things like that. And then a little bit at life expectancy I guess. Right. Exactly. But it you know depends on what you what you pay initially. <SEP> Yeah. But you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger. That's right. Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage. <SEP> Uh-huh. And she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton. Uh-huh. It's you know. We we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles. But uh the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it. <SEP> Uh-huh. So But uh. <SEP> Okay. Uh I've had uh I've had one or two American cars I think. And and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once. And and I never had a problem with it. But uh my mother had a Dodge at one point. And I I had driven it a few times. And I really did not feel that it that I would buy a Dodge j- just from. Um. <SEP> Well actually I had a uh a Dodge Omni at one point. Uh-huh. And that was I think what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality uh car. Yeah. <SEP> So I guess you'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car. That's interesting. But. Yeah. It it's hard to beat some of the. Uh like I guess in particular we're looking at a like a ninety-one Corsica uh buy back at a they say G M sponsored auction. But I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you. <SEP> Which is a good deal. Yeah. Because I guess uh. I mean well ninety-twos granted but the new ones you know. Uh-huh. Fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot. <SEP> Right. So all the depreciation has been taken off. And s- the dealer comes out okay you know. Yeah. That. I don't know what kind of I don't know what G M corporate kind of hit the I don't know what kind of hit they take on it. But sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it. And So but uh I don't know. <SEP> Yeah. I'm sure they did. We keep looking at that mini van. It's just you know. We can get a like a Caravan for at twelve five. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now. But uh uh it's interesting. But uh I don't know. If if uh it seems to be.
