. Well we have. We used to when I was younger. Yeah. <SEP> We'd go every weekend. All right. But we haven't done m- l- whole lot of it lately. Yeah. I'm kind of into it. I'm uh kind of a sailor. <SEP> Yeah. I'm up in Minneapolis now. But I was in Florida. So uh yeah. I was kind of into it for a while there. Were you sailboating? Yeah. For the most part. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I had a little sail. Well we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here. No. <SEP> Just motorboat's all we. What part of Texas you from? Uh Nacogdoches. Okay. Whereabouts is that? <SEP> That's between Houston and Dallas. Okay. All right. It's the oldest town in Texas. Is that right? <SEP> Yeah. Wow. That's pretty wild. We have uh Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches. So we do a lot of boating on. Okay. So you got some lakes around you can do that on. <SEP> Yeah. You do skiing and stuff. Or. Yeah. Little bit. Yeah? All right. <SEP> Just got through snow skiing. Yeah? Yeah. All right. <SEP> Just came back from Denver. But. Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah. We've uh our. The snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now. Yeah. It it it was heavy when we were there though. Yeah. <SEP> I didn't see any boats there though. Not not not too many no. But uh no. I just got back from a weekend. We went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing. It was pretty nice. But uh no I I have uh I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I do did a lot of sailing on and stuff. <SEP> Yeah? That's a lot of fun. But uh my parents are pretty big sailors too. They're kind of into it. Uh all we all we have up here mostly bass boats. Oh yeah. I guess it's pretty uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh? <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Lot of lot of fishing going on up here. Yeah. All right. So where about in Texas is that? Is that centrally located. Or. <SEP> It's uh well. You ever heard of Lufkin? Uh no. What what major city is nearby? Houston. Okay. And that's south or north of there or something? <SEP> Let me see. Houston's north. Yeah? Okay. Dallas is south. Oh okay. All right. Well that sounds pretty good. Does uh. I guess the weather. Does that stay pretty constant there. Or. <SEP> It's it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons. Yeah? Probably seventies eighties in the afternoon. Okay. Well that's pretty temperate. Yeah. That's not too bad. But uh yeah. Have you done uh any other boating then. Or. <SEP> No. I hadn't done any in a l- uh lately. But that's all. I used to ha- uh have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop. Yeah? And we used to when I was in high school we used to go out go boating every day just about. Oh that's great. Yeah. I. <SEP> And we had a n- different boat every day. Oh that's fantastic. Yeah. I used to uh kind of be that way myself when I lived in uh north western Florida in the panhandle. I used to sail about every day. I'd work go to work. I'd like to do some sailing. Yeah. It's a lot of fun. It's uh. Especially if you get a a pretty fast boat. Like those catamarans are pretty fast. <SEP> Yeah. What. You can actually. Do if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that. Or they just. Well actually I I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life. Uh my family's pretty into it. <SEP> Yeah. And uh I took sailing lessons when I was about six. And then uh. Is it pretty easy? Yeah. It it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know uh just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it. <SEP> Yeah. So it's it's not too bad. It's pretty easy to get the hang of I think. And uh generally everybody I've I've known has kind of gotten into it. But some people are more motorboaters you know which is fine. Yeah. <SEP> Well that's about all we have. Yeah. Yeah. Lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing. But then again they may nev- m- they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran. Uh-huh. And uh that's when you really start getting into speed. You know. You actually some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers. They get so fast you know. <SEP> I didn't know that. Yeah. They get pretty quick. But. That that would be something. Uh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I haven't I haven't personally done that. But uh the races. I I work with a guy right now that uh races catamarans in the summertime. Uh-huh. And uh he's pretty gassed about it. He's got a good uh. <SEP> What kind of what lake do you all use? Well he uh he's from Detroit. Uh-huh. So he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes I think and does his sailing. Uh. For me I I go back to Orlando uh in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast. We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast. And there's a lot of places there you can go you know. So uh so that's a good thing. <SEP> Yeah. But yeah so what do you do for a job? Uh I build transformers. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. Okay. Is that for T I. Or. No. It's for Cooper Industries. Okay. Are they primarily electronic then? <SEP> Yeah. Okay. Well. Well that. <SEP> They have a you know worldwide. But. Right. W- all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that. Oh okay. <SEP> Great. Yeah. How do you like it down there in Texas? It's real nice. Yeah? <SEP> Been here all my life. Oh no doubt. Yeah. Okay. I've never been to Texas. I've been to Oklahoma. But uh that's about as far as. <SEP> Oh it's n- Oklahoma's nothing like it. Yeah? Okay. Well that's good because I didn't like Oklahoma that well.
