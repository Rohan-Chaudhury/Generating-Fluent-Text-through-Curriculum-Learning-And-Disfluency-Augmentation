Uh a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either uh elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users. Uh-huh. And uh I know the the government is uh you know gives drug tests an- to all new entrants all new appli- applicants coming into government. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it. I I'm I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian. And and I I feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background. Of course we're we're. Being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks. And and so uh but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that. <SEP> Sure. Sure. And uh I have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to whatever it is to to you know break this uh activity. Huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs. And there isn't anything. But getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope. Yeah. What's your uh feeling? <SEP> Uh well I guess I I guess I'm probably a little more to toward the other direction. Uh well I guess mainly because uh it's I well. Like there's two sides to it I guess. Uh one is that uh if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then I I think that that you know I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot. Uh but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business. Uh and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go. You know we had prohibition for awhile. And then we didn't have prohibition. Uh you know we've had I guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years I guess. Uh-huh. <SEP> Maybe a little longer. Well I think uh the dr- the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that. Yeah. So ei- eighty years or so. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Uh so I. You know it's it's hard to I guess for me to justify what so- seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amen- you know freedom from uh search and seizure you know uh on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten. Who knows. Well the thing of it is the the tha- tha- that that is uh uh in in many respects uh uh you know just just I think an over simplification. I mean prohibition certainly didn't last. I I think there th- th- th- there's so much criminal activity uh that people go into to to support drug habits. <SEP> Well but you got to look at prohibition though. You had the same problems there right? Yeah. You know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that. Yeah. Oh yeah. Sure. Well it goes back to that again. If you look at prohibition. I mean because it's illegal it costs more. If it was legal. I mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce. I I I must admit that. <SEP> And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap. And you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it. Yeah. But yeah. Get uh. Yeah. I I must admit that the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and and the costs to society. Yeah. <SEP> Oh yeah. Well that's why there's you know people dealing it because there's money in it you know. There's ridiculous amounts of money. But I I I I think that that the that you know the being in law enforcement you know th- th- th- they I I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it. And but but the uh uh I I really feel as though the interdiction effort is is. As soon as you you get rid of one goon that's that's that's involved in drugs and tha-. <SEP> Oh yeah. Interdiction's hopeless. I mean. Yeah. And then another another one will jump up. There's no way you're ever going to win that. But we we see. <SEP> The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is. I mean that's a losing fight. Yeah. A- a- as soon as we wind up uh uh you know for. Well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand. But but people want to get get stoned. Yeah. Yeah. And I I don't see that. <SEP> Well yeah. It goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people. I mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen? Yeah. I don't think you can. I mean you know I'm you know was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic. So you know I'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people. Uh-huh. <SEP> So you know yeah. I can really relate to. Yeah. Everybody ought to do their own share. You know. I don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff. Uh-huh. But you know.
