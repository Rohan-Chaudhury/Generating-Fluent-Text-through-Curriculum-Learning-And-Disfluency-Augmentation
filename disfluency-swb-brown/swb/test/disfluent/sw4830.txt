You want to go first? No. You can start. Okay. Uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we d- wh- what do we think about a judge making the decision? <SEP> Uh-huh. And I really don't agree with that. I think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than e- having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time. Right. Yo- you know what I mean? <SEP> Right. There's there th- this topic is kind of mute. Uh. Yeah. There there's no way. We we couldn't survive in a sy- in a juror syst- in a trial system without a jury. Right. <SEP> Uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case. That's it. Uh every person has their opinions. And that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh. Well I I feel the other thing too uh. They were saying uh you know what new ways could y- could it you you know change the system. I I really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal. <SEP> I mean i- if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught you know point blank in the crime. There's uh no question. Right. It's beyond a reasonable doubt. You know all these things. I mean you know we've gone through this over and over again. <SEP> Right. They shouldn't allow an appeal. And it can go on for ten twenty years. <SEP> Yep. I I think this is a little ridiculous. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers. Oh that's right. I work for a law firm. I I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha- that exist in the s- in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining. <SEP> Right. You know if someone is ill. Well plea bar- plea bargaining is a different story. Well. <SEP> Plea bargaining is something completely different. That that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up. Well I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard. I mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they. I don't know how it works exactly. But you know they get lesser sentences. Right. And I understand that the jails are full of people you know uh and that they have to do something. <SEP> Right. But I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it. Huh. Yo- you know what I'm saying? That w- we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment. <SEP> Right. And uh I I think they should. We do. I and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people. And uh you know all. <SEP> Right. They they're caught dead to rights. I I just think that that's they've they've taken a life. And if they should pay for it with their life. Right. When you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned. Yeah. <SEP> We just have the case. I'm I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry. Uh-huh. Uh his f- last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up. Oh really. <SEP> So I mean his appeal was denied. And two days later he got out of jail. For cocaine possession. It uh. Yeah. <SEP> But uh that was absurd. There is never there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence. I know that that. Uh-huh. And I don't know. Uh what would you do to change it? To make it better? <SEP> Well uh the the only I can I wa- you know. The appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Uh a- like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd. There's no way that could work. Oh yeah. I I I don't agree with that at all. Uh but. Imagine the guilt that person would have. I mean burned out. <SEP> Oh exactly. There's there's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself. Exactly. <SEP> Right. If you had to do something like that day after day. No one would want the job. No. Not really. <SEP> Uh and you know like I said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case. Well w- do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like. Oh yeah. I I feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury. That that that right s-. I mean supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you. <SEP> Well I mean were there witnesses? In other words you're saying that w- you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were. Right. <SEP> Right. That you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case. Yeah. I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place. Yeah. <SEP> And you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances. Well I I.
