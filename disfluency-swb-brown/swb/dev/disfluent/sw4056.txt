Okay. Should begin. Okay. All right. Uh I can begin this um. Basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the the benefit program we have here is really quite good. I'm I'm pretty pleased with it. They cover uh just about everything vision dental medical. Uh-huh. Uh you name it. And for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much. So I'm pretty satisfied myself. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um what's your situation? I work for the University of New Hampshire. And uh our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in some ways. Uh you know. Oh. <SEP> Overall I'm satisfied with it. We don't have the vision care. We do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental. Uh-huh. Uh. Are you a professor there? <SEP> No. I work in I'm a on the professional administrative and technical staff. And I effectively I run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire. Oh I see. Okay. Uh so the uh the benefits. Uh probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time. Oh no doubt. <SEP> We get fifteen days a year sick time. And uh we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off. Right. Well that's good. Yeah. Yeah. That's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell is uh. I used to work with the Army Research Institute. And being a uh a government organization you got quite a few holidays off. <SEP> Right. But here you don't get that. You maybe get two or three a year. Uh-huh. So it's really. Unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time. <SEP> Uh-huh. So that's that's kind of a drawback I think. But uh. I don't know. What do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits? Well I think uh the the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know. Yeah. I'm I'm a little disturbed about that. But I think that's a national trend. And I don't know that uh I don't know what the solution is to it. It's bigger than just the benefits part. Yeah. I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night. They uh they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. It's kind of an interesting plan. It's kind of cold though. They've essentially made up a list of uh oh all the different uh medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff. <SEP> Oh yeah. About six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care. And the ones above would. Um. So it's kind of like drawing this line. And and if you have it great. If you don't you're kind of out of luck. <SEP> Uh-huh. But um it was kind of an interesting show. Um. I think you're right. I think health care is probably the the most pressing uh the pressing one. <SEP> Right. But I'll tell you I I don't mind having dental you know. Sometimes dental costs can be um just about as expensive if not more. And I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical. Uh-huh. But I'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more. I'm not sure. How how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it? <SEP> Well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending. And and the cost between them is very is very little. I think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan. Um. But it pays uh a substantial amount. I mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free. Great. <SEP> And uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses. Is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh professors and and also staff and administration. Is that generally across the board do you think. Or. Uh yes. It is. The benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. But the main. I think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan. But the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh okay. Uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's you know based on how long they've worked there. Right. <SEP> That determines how much uh vacation time they get. Yeah. I'm kind of interested because I'm actually that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to uh is to teach in a university. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now. Oh. But uh. Yeah. That's that's interesting. That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that. <SEP> College programs belong to this T I A A uh C R E F retirement fund. Oh is that right? Right. And in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh.
