Um what's our topic? Taxes. Taxes. <SEP> Do we pay too much? Right. Right. Um. Well do we? What do you do? <SEP> Um. I guess that. I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in. My tax bracket is is pretty high up there. I pay the I generally pay the maximum tax bracket. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I think that we're paying too much. Because I don't have any children. Right. And I pay a lot of property taxes. Oh sure. <SEP> I don't have any um I don't you know I don't use an awful lot of city services. It it you know it's like I have to work m- I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And um y- there's so many people who want a a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I just. Sometimes many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes. Right. How about you? Do you pay too much? Uh well no. I can't really complain. I'm a student um. And I d- I work as a co-op at uh Georgia Tech Research Institute. And uh I'm going to get back most of what I earned I mean most of what I pay in taxes. And uh and uh on- one of my parents is still claiming me. <SEP> Well when you when you go out into the uh when you go out into the working world it it changes quickly. Huh? Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm sure. Um you look at your paycheck. And you go oh my gosh where did it all go. <SEP> Um what kind of what kind of. Uh well have you pay a lot of in ta-. Have you been out working and then gone back to school. Or are you did you go directly from high school into into college? I went. Well I did work um just very for some time. But I didn't make enough money to really make too much of a difference. To worry about it. Right. <SEP> Have you have you been active in in politics trying to concerning this? Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that? No. No. I haven't. I uh I haven't done any of that type of work myself. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um but every once in a while when I hear up here at at uh in D C area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the Congress. Um Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there you know. There's a bank that they all bank with. And I guess it went defunct recently. Uh-huh. And one of the Congressmen has has written in the last three years al- about a thousand bad checks. Huh. <SEP> And we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho- all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule. Oh. Really? <SEP> And um it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to D C anyway. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur. Oh sure. Um I I I think we pay too much. And I've I look at my paycheck. And I make. Well let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think I pay forty-two percent. Wow. Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government. <SEP> And then they charge me sales tax. And they charge me gasoline taxes. Uh-huh. Taxes. And they charge me all these others. And it's just too expensive. Uh-huh. <SEP> I can't believe that. I I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for. Huh. You know what I mean? Yeah. <SEP> Do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government? No. No. I haven't. Uh I uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition.

Heavy science. <SEP> Are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that. Or is it more um applied physics? Um I haven't I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet. Actually um the the degree I'm getting is physics. There's a different one for applied physics. So I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied. Okay. <SEP> Well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's come rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward. I doubt about that. Are are is America I mean are we pretty pretty steep compared to most countries? <SEP> Actually I don't think we are. No. I don't think so either. Um like like Europe um England. I know the taxes are a lot higher. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> But they do have socialized medicine and things like that. Yeah.
