Pretty good. Pretty good. So we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh. Drug testing in the work place. Um. I've been tested a few times just before pre- drug employment. But that's about it. I've never had random drug testing. Yeah. We have random drug testing at in my business. But I've never been uh never had to do it. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. They started that about a year ago. And I think it's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff. Uh-huh. But uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time. At least that's. <SEP> Oh they do with alcohol. Pardon? They do it with alcohol? Yeah. Yeah. They they they'll check for alcohol. <SEP> Oh I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine. No. Once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing. Huh. That's interesting. Yeah. It's a. <SEP> What type of field of work are you in? I'm in the oil business. Oh in the oil business. Yeah. <SEP> Okay. And you work in the office around. Yeah. I work in the office. So uh it's pretty pretty safe environment. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. See I work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And we work around a lot of explosives. Well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on. <SEP> Yeah. So that's you know. I'm all for it because the well the type of environment I work in you know they're working with explosives. And so they could blow up the whole. Well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use. But still it can be dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. Well I I I agree. I think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff. Yeah. You know. If it's. As long as it's not abused uh you know random you know. As long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected I don't have that big a problem with it. <SEP> Now do they fire them or do they? Well see this is it. This is where I start having my problems with my company. I work for a private company. And and the policy is something like see if I can re- state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired. Oh wow. So it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos. <SEP> Huh that's. I think our policy is that. All right it's probably the same thing. I'm not really sure what the. Yeah. Really. It's one of those things that you read once. And then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it. That's right. But I know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance. But I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Our company's a little tougher on the second chance. I mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way I think a little bit more to uh to help you get help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job. Uh-huh. But uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply. <SEP> Uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits. Well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment. And you know it's not. I guess I ha- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem. Uh-huh. Uh so I gue- you know I guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery. I mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked. <SEP> Uh-huh. So uh I'd rather have that than you know say well this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in. And next week C -s and D -s are going to come in. <SEP> You could time it just right. Yeah. Right. Right. I know one employee. I know when I was working with he had alcohol on his breath. And I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not. That'd be just as dangerous. Yeah. Well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff. <SEP> Huh. That's true. You know I've I've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case. Uh-huh. Do they give any limits on alcohol. Or is it? Uh I don't remember to tell you the truth. I don't think they do. Um well they must. I mean gee whiz. That just shows you how much I've been paying attention. Because I I really don't know. <SEP> I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask. Oh. Well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far. Uh there was a company in Houston that. They did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of. It was not only drugs.
