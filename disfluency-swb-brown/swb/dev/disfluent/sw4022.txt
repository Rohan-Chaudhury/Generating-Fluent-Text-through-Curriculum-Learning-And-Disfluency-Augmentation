Well uh I don't know. I think the budget is really out of hand right now. And especially in this election year I think that uh there ought to be so- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It kind of seems to me that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's when it's just such a bad time for it. Right. Right. And uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts. Uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering. <SEP> Yeah. The ninety-seven cents a week. Yeah. Ninety-seven cents a week. Now what. That's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Another ninety-seven cents. Hell you can buy a coke or something for that. Yeah. I mean mostly it's it's not actually a a a cut. It's just a cut in the withhold in the amount withheld you know. Yeah. <SEP> Um yeah. I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot. That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either. Huh-uh. Uh I I haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either. Especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I mean you know in retrospect um was it was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know I'll I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes? I believe it was Dukakis. <SEP> It was Dukakis. Yeah. But I I can't. I have a lot of respect for him. Yeah. I mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said No. I will not. <SEP> Yeah. Read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know I I can't follow through on this. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it seems to me that uh that the budget is so out of hand. And especially now that they say Okay the cold war is over. And we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year. Uh-huh. Well I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go. Because in my opinion I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this peace so-called peace dividend. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. It's it's. I mean if they could actually put something together and make. I'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because I feel that they waste money also. Uh-huh. But with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh yeah. I uh I I think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where. Right. Ex- Exactly. <SEP> It wou- it wou- it would help unemployment greatly. And it. And in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country. <SEP> Yeah. Infra structure is in is in. I mean we we we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the cold war. Yeah. And and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least I feel unless we focus on the infra structure. And I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um yeah. I I agree totally. Um I mean this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen. Um I I'm in college right now. And. So am I. <SEP> Oh really. Where do you go? Uh I U. Right. I go to Georgia Tech um. Uh-huh. <SEP> And in. What. I had pol- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago. Uh-huh. And one of the things we discussed was you know where our where the budget situate- how the budget situation just got so out of hand. Right. <SEP> And essentially what happened was. I think it was like in the um tax year of eighty-one um. Ronald Reagan basically said you know I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the Congress would not in their right mind pass. Right. And Con- Congress realizing that they were going to lose a the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know bye-bye you know bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And you just. You you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington. <SEP> I mean it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun. Yeah. Uh well it's it's more than a loaded. It's a loaded cannon. I mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year. Yeah. And they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well yeah. Um what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're we're going to have to do some unpopular things I mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected. Oh no. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where people just want want to have you know whatever will make them feel good right now you know. For for the moment. And that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or you know it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference. Uh-huh. It. I mean I don't know. I I don't I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. No. No. Not at all. <SEP> I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive. No.
