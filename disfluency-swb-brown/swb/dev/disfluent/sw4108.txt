Okay. Uh so what do you think uh about putting the elderly in a nursing home? Well I think that it it varies on on the individual basis. <SEP> Huh. Uh sometimes it is there is no alternative. Uh-huh. Uh you do not have uh uh family available or family that's uh. You may not even have family that is uh uh in you know who are around. <SEP> That's true. Yeah. So sometimes it's not an alternative. Huh. And I think uh but I think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time. Sometimes in a nursing home. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh especially if if it's after an acute illness. To get over a. Or to rehab after uh an illness. That's true. I never thought of that. Yeah. Sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time. <SEP> That's true. Until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with. Uh-huh. Because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to. <SEP> Yes. They really are. They don't like to keep them longer than a week. So so there is some good to it. <SEP> Yeah. Uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job. You know the fam- well the families do not necessarily uh know what to do with them. <SEP> What do you mean? And they don't want to take the responsibility. So they will put them in a nursing home. Yeah. That's true. So you see uh. There's both sides to it too. What do you think? <SEP> Yeah. And it depends on how how sick the person is too. What you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I would personally like it. If my parents were to get ill I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help. That's not always possible. That's true. <SEP> But uh to the best of my ability I'd like to do it until it gets impossible. I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to. It's there's not a choice it's because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. So that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it. <SEP> That's true. Yeah. So. But I think nursing homes can be good. It just depends on what kind they are. You know you need to check them out ahead of time. Yeah. And then there's also some that are set up for specialties. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I know some. Unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have I guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wonder or or uh confused or have some mental problem. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. That they're. And you need a special nursing home for that. You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around. Yeah. And you need people who are trained for that type of problem. <SEP> Right. Who know what they're doing with that. Yeah. So so there's different types of nursing homes I think. <SEP> Yeah. Well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it. And she really liked the idea of of moving there. She's not ill yet. Uh-huh. But uh she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years. And then she decided that uh she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden. She's very independent. So she's in this nursing home. It's out in the country. And uh she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook. Gives her a little bit of her own independence. <SEP> Uh-huh. But she still has uh a security there. Right. Some support. And then there's also uh sort of a wing for those people that do get sick. And what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now. And then so if she ever does become ill uh it will be like family around her. That's right. And I I've seen some of them like that too. <SEP> Yeah. And also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Sh-. So it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place. Uh-huh. <SEP> No. She loves it. She has a great social life. And she travels. And uh it's in in the very in the mountains. And it's beautiful. And uh I I hope that I have something like that when I get older. Yeah. I I think I think the uh I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the uh elderly uh person who's going in and the family that's going to be uh effec- effected by it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh definitely it's. And uh you know sometimes it can those choi- those choices can be made in advance. And sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're. <SEP> Right.
