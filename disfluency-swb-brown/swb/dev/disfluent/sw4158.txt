Um are you working right now? Uh yes. I am. I'm working in the computer science department here uh at C M U. Uh. <SEP> What kind of what kind of work do you do? Uh I'm doing basically system system design work and uh implementation work for the speech for the speech group uh here. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh. Wh-. Is that how you heard about this thing? <SEP> Yeah. Uh. Actually through electronic mail. Uh-huh. Me too. I work at uh the Georgia Tech Research Institute. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um I'm a co-op student. So I work and go to school about halftime. And uh I really don't have any job benefits to speak of. We're kind of um. I don't know. They just kind of forget us on that end. We don't really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really. So. Right. So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away at at this point. Exactly. <SEP> Exactly. Yeah. What about you? <SEP> Well um t- i- I'm research stuff here now. So what they they have uh um okay benefits package. It's not quite as good as industry. But one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um. And they pay for you know pay for the classes. Huh. So Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit. Yeah. <SEP> Uh they do that I think if you're uh research here. Then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters. And I think that um they might you know pay for that. Pay for the classes and stuff. Uh-huh. But I know they let you they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage. You know they'll let you work halftime if you want to if you want to finish. <SEP> If you want to do it quickly. You want to. Yeah. They'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if you want to get your masters. And then I think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due. So that will probably help out. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But Do you get any kind of health care type stuff? Yeah. Yeah. So I I don't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary. I'd you know I. <SEP> Yeah. We we do. We have to contribute a certain amount uh to it. Uh-huh. And it's kind of split between C M U and and you know the employee. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I think I mean that's pretty that's a pretty important uh part of it there because that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems. My dad I think my. I'm still covered on with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works. But it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own. <SEP> Right. Yeah. And it's also right now it's uh the. Like everywhere else uh. Here in Pittsburgh the health care uh rates are are going up pretty quickly. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's a whole other topic to begin with too. They have. But. Yeah. But it's you are right. I I I really agree that that that's pretty important. Well the only I think the I guess the only real um benefit I guess you could say working for me working here besides I mean. I'm learning and stuff because I'm at you know in school. <SEP> Right. But there's there's some weird law where uh uh student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh. Though that's about five percent right there. <SEP> Now that's a big win. So. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's. That's about the only real bonus. Yeah. I have so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid real you know because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to you know pay an extra five percent or so. <SEP> Yeah. I figured for. And they've just raised the um income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well. Huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well if you could call it a benefit that C M U I mean i-. The other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies. Oh yeah? <SEP> Um so that's that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> You know in case you know in case you ever need to bail out. Help a lot. Yeah. See around around here it's like uh. We pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors. <SEP> Uh-huh. There's not there is not a whole lot of you know funded research from.
