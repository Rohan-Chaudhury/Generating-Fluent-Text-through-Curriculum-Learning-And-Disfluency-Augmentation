-kay Dave. What kind of pets do you have? Oh we have one rotten cat. One rotten cat. <SEP> Yeah. It's my son's cat. I heard a laugh in the background. Yeah. That's the boys. They know I don't like it. Don't you like cats? <SEP> Well I like cats. This this cat is a uh more like a dog. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's uh a one owner. He likes one boy in the family and that's about it. That's odd. How does he treat the other people? <SEP> Just uh stays away or runs usually. Wow. But he follows he'll follow my oldest son around. You know when he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap. But if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing. Did he raise him or something? <SEP> He's he we bought the cat for him. And so he's uh been the one that you know spent the most time with him. But I I've never owned a cat like that. I've had cats growing up all the time. And you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody. Uh-huh. <SEP> Huh that's interesting. So it's a weird cat. Huh. We have a a mutt. <SEP> A mutt. Well we we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from. Uh-huh. Uh some lady she uh. A lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house. <SEP> Oh. And she use to work for a veter- veterinarian. So she would spay- uh neuter them give them all their shots. Uh-huh. And we saw an ad saying it was free. So we went down there and picked it up. And it's been an excellent dog. But it's my first dog I've had. And we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work. <SEP> Uh-huh. So that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work. So that is that is that kind of your child right now? Uh yeah. Right now it it is. <SEP> You feel like. It's kind of good training. I mean we have been trying for kids. But right now we haven't had any. Oh uh-huh. But it's pretty good training I think really keeps her on her toes. <SEP> Have have you had dogs before? Uh my brother has. Uh we didn't do a lot with them. Uh I never felt like it was mine or anything. You couldn't do anything. Uh-huh. But I mean that did did more responsibility. When it's yours and not your brother's. <SEP> Yeah. But. Well I just uh we've you know. When I was growing up I had we always had a dog. And we had mostly mutts. Well not mutts but mixes you know like one or two mix. Uh-huh. <SEP> And those dogs always seem to be the best dogs. That's what we found. Ours is uh like a cockapoo. Uh-huh. I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it's a really good dog. Yeah. I don't know. They seem to be I mean listen better or something. <SEP> Uh-huh. Is your cat a purebred? No. No. It's just uh an accident. <SEP> From a frie- uh from my my son's friend down the street. They're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens. Uh-huh. And so. Would you ever want a dog in the family? <SEP> Uh we I would. We uh we had a dog that was a uh mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador. Uh-huh. And uh I should say a pup. And he was just too big for our kids when we got him. Oh yeah. <SEP> And we when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet. And it was a dog that we gotten. And he was he was just too big. Uh-huh. Uh the kids couldn't handle him. And I was still going to school. And my wife was working. And I was working. And so we just didn't have time to really train him. So he was kind of jus- you know he was too big for the kids to handle. So he was just tied up to a post. Oh yeah. <SEP> So we gave him to uh. I don't know if you've. There is a place out here uh called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville. Uh-huh. And they have uh. I guess it's kind of an animal shelter. But he just takes a few the animals in. And some he destroys. And some he keeps. Uh-huh. <SEP> So we took him up there. And he ended up keeping him. Uh cause he has had him for six or seven years. We we've saw him just about a year ago. And uh I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away. Uh-huh. And so we asked him about it one day. And he said yeah. He's been the best dog I've ever had in my life. Wow. <SEP> Just goes everywhere with him. I he would have been a great great dog. He just needed a lot of time.
