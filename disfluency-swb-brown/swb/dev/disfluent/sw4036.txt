I think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted. Definitely. Um and I think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that. I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. <SEP> Uh-huh. Have you ever served on a jury before? Uh I have twice. Oh okay. <SEP> It was a pretty wild experience. Uh what sorts of cases were they? They were just you know small time cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know. So were they criminal or civil? <SEP> They were civil. They weren't they weren't any criminal. Oh okay. What uh what was the verdict? Did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? <SEP> Uh the jury it was uh let me see I think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people. Yeah. So it was. They. And uh the one changed his vote at the end. So did it become? <SEP> So it became unanimous you know after they turned it in. Yeah. And then he changed his mind after they turned it in. Uh. <SEP> But it then became unanimous. Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right? You just needed a majority? Right. What was what was the other case? That was also civil? <SEP> The the other case was just traffic. The. And you know it was seat belt law. Yeah. And it it didn't even hardly go through. Oh didn't really even count. <SEP> So. Yeah. I'm I'm a college student. So I haven't been you know a jury eligible age for very long. Yeah. Um and uh I did get one summons actually at one point. But I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student because it was uh a very bad time. <SEP> Yeah. Well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though. Yeah I mean I I really I would like to uh to do at some point um. But I I haven't. Uh one one thing that I I think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh I I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now. But I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well. Especially sort of. I wouldn't think that it does I mean from from my from what I experienced in them. How wha-. <SEP> It didn't you know it didn't turn out the way I planned it I mean the way that I would think that it would go. Uh you thought it turned out pretty well? Yeah. But it was you know it was. Jury was unorganized. And it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me. Yeah. <SEP> I'm not used to it not being organized. And I just assumed that it would have been. Oh so it was just kind of a zoo. And the jurors just sort of. Someone had to figure out what was going on? That's about what it was. Um. That's interesting. Did it did it work out pretty well in the end? I mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial. Or. <SEP> Yeah. They well they picked one person. And then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. So it work- it did end up working out pretty well? Yeah. It ended up working all right. The one thing I sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes. <SEP> Yes. You know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy. And it's just a matter of interpreting a contract. It's sort of a matter of um you know sometimes getting into very technical issues. And I wonder if uh if there's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion. I I don't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what's going on. In in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. So. <SEP> Yeah. The the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer that which was uh seemingly their property. Yeah. Uh. <SEP> It was on his property. Oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it. And he hadn't made the payments. Right. <SEP> So they came to get it. Yeah. And then when they came to get it well it was on the landlord's property. And he wouldn't let them take it off. Uh so they were suing to get it back. <SEP> So and they are it was a double wide. So they'd already taken it apart. Uh. So they left it there. Yeah. <SEP> And then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it. Uh. So they were suing him for the money. And you know there's no way they could because it it was the moving company.
