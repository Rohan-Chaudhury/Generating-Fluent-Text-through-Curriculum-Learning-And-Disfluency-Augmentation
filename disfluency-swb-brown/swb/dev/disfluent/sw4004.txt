How do you feel about the Viet Nam war? Huh well um you know I guess it's pretty deep feelings uh. I just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it GOOD MORNING VIET NAM. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh. Yeah. I saw that as well. Got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together the feelings. I really appreciated the the whole uh English class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do it you know. The guy's gouging gouging your eyes out. What are you going to do? Uh-huh. <SEP> You know what for him to finish me off. And uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of Asian philosophy that uh. Uh-huh. Well were you ever in Viet Nam. <SEP> Or. No. No. I was kind of an in-between uh finally drew a high draft number. And you? Um I was much too young. I was born in sixty-seven. So. <SEP> Oh. Um you know both my well both my brothers were um draft age. But neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for. Well I personally uh you know uh I just went in limbo. I had a passport and was ready to go or um out of the country or join special forces either one. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean I just didn't know. So uh. Well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there? Um yeah. Just a second. Okay. <SEP> Okay. Sure. Now. Well Mark um what was that again? Um do you think I mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it? No. Not not really. I totally agree with that. Um. <SEP> Um. What what effects do you think it's had on our country? Downside. Um uh well. The says we should uh go into the grief that that's there. And you know presidents have always avoided that as a country. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's pretty serious really you know. Lot of things that aren't being addressed. Uh-huh. I think you know that's pretty typical that of the entire entire involvement over that you know that nothing was really addressed. It was- it wasn't you know it was never. We we announced that we were going to war. It was such a gradual and subtle you know thi- um you know increasement of of force that. Yeah. <SEP> Gulf of Tonkin uh resolution. And was it a dolphin or a torpedo. You remember that? I vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something. Yeah. Yeah. Only only it was foggy. And finally President Johnson said well they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo. Oh. <SEP> Isn't that something? Uh-huh. Um. So um do do do you think that like uh um for example like in in this past war in the Persian Gulf war that uh that you see it seemed to me that that Bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um you know prepare the country for war. Uh-huh. <SEP> Hey Mark I've got to go um. Yeah. Okay. <SEP> We'll see you. I guess our five minutes are up according to me. Are they to you? Uh I wasn't really keeping count. But I guess. Good-bye. Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.
