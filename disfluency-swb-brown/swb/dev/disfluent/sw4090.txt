Okay Eric. Uh are you married. And do you have a family? Uh yes I am to uh both questions. Okay. And do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances. <SEP> Uh yeah. We do. We uh uh. Basically there's the you know the expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month. Uh-huh. And we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet. And uh whatever is left uh after that we you know we sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for. <SEP> Uh-huh. I see. Uh. <SEP> So what do you do? Well that's basically what we do. Uh about every every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget. And we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest. Uh-huh. And then we divvy them up between our four pay checks. I work part time at night. <SEP> Wow. And he works and my husband works full times days. And so we have four checks. But that works out nice because we get paid every week. And so that does help. Yeah. <SEP> That helps a lot. And then uh we don't have a lot ex- extra for extra spending. So it's pretty well ear marked. <SEP> Yeah. All allocated out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Every penny is ear marked. But uh it we have found that works the best. And and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up. In fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half. But and divide those up between all. Uh-huh. <SEP> All the checks. Yeah. And so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one. And then the next pay check we're real short. Or. Right. Yeah. We found that uh it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses. <SEP> That's true. We were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were uh spending uh money for things that you know. We kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it was easy to uh let things get out of hand. We thought it uh thought it to be really helpful. We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that. Yeah. <SEP> So. Well it helps you to focus where your money goes. Yeah. And and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget. But you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in. And then you're saying my word where did all that money go. <SEP> That's a lot of money. But. Where does it go? Yeah. Uh. <SEP> But. And also we have found that if we write down. And we did this. We are not real consistent with this. But we did it for about a month. And we wrote down everything that we bought when you know every pay check. Uh-huh. And so we could see where every penny went. And it was really interesting to see just what you do spend. And like I say we haven't been real consistent with it. It's. We should cause it does help. <SEP> Yeah. The other the other thing that that we've found that helps is you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit. Uh-huh. It's just to uh uh get up the money in advance and put it in uh uh so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in uh in an envelope or whatever. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount. And then once that was gone well if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say oh it's gone. Wel- just stick to that. Uh-huh. That is. <SEP> Yeah. That that sounds like a really good idea. <SEP> So. And it really helpful. Uh have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet? <SEP> We we haven't. We our our initial goal was just to retire debt uh completely retire debt for car payments and credit card uh credit card debt and all of that. Oh uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> We are just at a point where where we could start thinking about it. So. Oh that's good. That's a good feeling. Yeah. Well I. My husband just graduated from the university uh a year ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. So finally finally we are getting to that point too. A student. So are you still going to school. Or. <SEP> Yeah. I am actually in the in the mas-.
