You have any pets? Do I have pets? Yeah. <SEP> Yes. I have a cat. And I have two dogs. Two dogs. What kind? I have a Schnauzer. And I have a Sheltie. Schnauzers. Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer? <SEP> It it's a miniature. Uh. I'm going into all this because I used to w- I just got done working at a pet shop actually. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. Well the Schnauzer I'm I'm watching for one of uh the managers where I work. And he's been transferred to Germany for a while. Uh. <SEP> And I'm taking care of his dog. And uh and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that. And he says well my dog doesn't like cats. And I said well we won't tell him it's a c- we won't tell her it's a cat because it was a kitten. <SEP> And you know they just they just love kittens. Yeah. They just are fascinated. Oh yeah. <SEP> So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet. That's good. They say. <SEP> And they get along real good. I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip. So that was interesting. Didn't expect that would happen. Yeah. That's cool. That's nice. Uh let's see. What was the other dog you had? <SEP> It's a sheltie. Oh a sheltie. She's real s- sweet little dog. She's got a very nice temperament. Uh they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer. Yeah. <SEP> You know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive. They can be nippy. Uh-huh. Yeah. Shelties are nice. Everybody seems to be really happy with them. They're good temperament. <SEP> They're a good temperament. They put up with a lot. And they and they just uh. They. I think they have a good head on their shoulders. I think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that I have encountered. Schnauzers in particular probably. <SEP> Well yeah. But also some poodles uh. Oh yeah. <SEP> They're kind of. There are some smart ones out there. But there's some also some uh not so smart ones. Yeah. I g-. It seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are. Yeah. That's that's maybe that's there's uh some credence in that statement. Yeah. The- they're bred down so much. It's. <SEP> Uh-huh. They aren't the best pets. I I'd I really don't know what the best pet is. Yeah. <SEP> I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal. Yeah. I mean some people seem fairly well suited for for uh miniature poodles and such. Um And bull dogs. <SEP> But I don't know about these uh these uh uh these pincers these now what are they called. Pit bulls pit bulls that are so vicious. Pit bull. <SEP> They might. They're actually very friendly dogs. Are they really? I don't think I've ever seen one. Uh they're really nice. <SEP> I I've dealt with quite a few of them. People uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like they uh fit collars and stuff on them. And they are they are just really nice really friendly uh kind of like medium intelligence. Uh. Well how do they become s-. W-. How did they get their reputation then? Well because some people uh want to train them as. <SEP> Oh they train them to be that way then. Yeah. Oh okay. You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. It takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond. Oh dear. So the the poor animal is doing it in self protection. <SEP> Right. Oh dear. Yeah. They aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters. They are very determined critters. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so once you get them going it's not good to to deal with but they I I really like them. I was I was impressed by them. They're they're real sturdy little critters. And they aren't that big. And uh just really friendly. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well that's unusual. I was I was overwhelmed. I. <SEP> Huh well I suppose you were surprised. Yeah. <SEP> After the reputation that you know. Yeah. Right now. They have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know. They picked up a lot of bad press lately. <SEP> Yeah. They're banned from in some areas I understand. Well yeah. Uh-huh. But any any any pet's going to can can be bad if you train it to be that way. <SEP> You know that. They must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're going. Well yeah. It's when. In my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a k- a child in a house. Oh okay. <SEP> Oh okay. Uh-huh. I mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret. The the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know they should expect something like that to happen. And so bas-. Now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town. Oh did it attack the child then? Yeah. It it bit him. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that was that was not a good thing. But I think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was f- it was a fairly wild ferret. Well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that. Hadn't they hadn't. <SEP> Yeah. I mean they really should have should have expected it. And taken the precautions. <SEP> Um. Sure. They didn't. Yeah. It's too bad it happened though. <SEP> Yeah. Because then the the animal's in trouble and not the person. Right.
