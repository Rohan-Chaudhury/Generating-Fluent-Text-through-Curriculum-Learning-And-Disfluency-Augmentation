Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore? That's a good question. Uh there would be a point there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed. But uh since I've become a parent and since I've seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that. I really uh I I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment. Uh. Of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um I I like the statement made by Cuomo. Cuomo I believe is. Um he's he's governor of New York. But uh he's uh against the death penalty. But um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife. And that's. But but even even in that circumstan- in that uh uh situation he would b- he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh keep him from doing the doing the things. Oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response. Right. Exactly. <SEP> Uh a- and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question. And he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion uh a gut level reaction. Uh-huh. And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. Uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting peop- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill. Yeah. <SEP> I think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reason humane one. See I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do. Are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together. Or are they. Is it a penal institution? Is it is is it designed for punishment? Um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment. Uh perhaps not in the manner that we do it. But but it in in theory it fits in. In reforma- system in a reformatory I mean. If you if you put someone to death you obviously can't reform them. <SEP> That's true. So. Uh th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent. And I really don't uh agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well I was about to kill and dismember this person. But oh if they catch me they're going to kill me. So I better not do it. I I just don't think that uh that it works that way. Yeah. <SEP> I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. I mean people say that. But I mean if it was really a deterrent I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west you know. They saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. Uh-huh. And if we really w- if it was really seriously going to be a d- deterrent I would think that it would be public. I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it. If someone ever. If you know. Like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by a firing squad or something like that. I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here at the you know. <SEP> Well I I don't know if that would really work that way or not. Uh there's a lot of violence.
