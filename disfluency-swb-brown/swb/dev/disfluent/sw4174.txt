Okay. Okay. Well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college. Uh-huh. <SEP> She's actually at Bible College for this current year. Uh-huh. And uh I guess uh first and foremost it really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program. And then it comes down to the dollar. You have to uh. It's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction. Or you know it does. Uh-huh. <SEP> It comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to. Damn it I agree with pretty much with everything you've said. Uh the one the one thing that I you know I'd advise any parent uh you know or any or any person looking for a college uh is that I think I think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there. Because you know they're just uh in my experience. I've talked to people at other colleges uh that you know. The the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the cat- catalogs isn't always the whole story. No. Y-. The the college. The the catalogs are sales material. Uh-huh. <SEP> It doesn't matter whether you know they're they're selling school. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh and true. It uh really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school. Uh-huh. Uh I guess there's a difference in. Here the. At least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students. <SEP> Like they just live in the community. Uh-huh. Uh you know I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit. Uh-huh. Yeah. I I go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh you know I think I really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's there's not the the you know. It tends to be a very conservative school. And there and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have. Yeah. Uh I guess we're here. This is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh on a small quantity of gas. Our engineering students. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh in competitions. And that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school. Uh-huh. Uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a a spirit of somewhat unkind but producing graduates. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Uh you know as sort of some development and some training uh. Like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to how you know what the attitude towards achievement is. Uh-huh. Uh do you uh have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh feed information to? I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that. Yeah. Uh I don't really know of anyone that's like look- that's looking for colleges now you know because it with the exception of uh people's younger brothers and sisters. Then the only advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech. <SEP> Uh but uh no. Actua- actually I'm I'm I'm more interested in in in choosing the right j- job when you graduate type information. Right. <SEP> Well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh you know to. Going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on the p- pa- programs person's involved in. Program. And after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself. Uh-huh. <SEP> And if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market. Uh-uh. Jeez. If that's. Uh-huh. Like a fine arts education. I. <SEP> Right. Best training in the world is not going to f- put food on your table. Uh-huh. But uh.
