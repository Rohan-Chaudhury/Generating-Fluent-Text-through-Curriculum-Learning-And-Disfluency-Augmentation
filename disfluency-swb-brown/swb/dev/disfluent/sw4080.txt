Okay. All right. What's your view. <SEP> Huh? What's your view? Well I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. I mean. You know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know. <SEP> That's right. That's right. I don't know. Coming from Texas you're probably. I don't know. I shouldn't make stereo types. But gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think. Yeah. It is. But I'm not really from I'm not really from Texas. I just live down here now. I've I've lived down here a couple years. Oh you're just live down there? <SEP> Yeah. I'm originally from Colorado. But yeah. Oh well. <SEP> There uh there uh there's a lot of hunters here. Yeah. Well I know how you feel. I'm uh I grew up in Nebraska. And and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know. And man there's no way. There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons. Uh-huh. That's just. I don't know. <SEP> I just think I think it's ridiculous. Yeah. I mean. It doesn't sit with me very well. I don't know I anymore. I keep a thirty-eight in my truck you know. <SEP> Really. Yeah. I just about all. Well I live in Minneapolis. And I. Well actually I live in Florida. But I am staying in Minneapolis for a year. And you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And it's just you never know who is out there. Right. You know it's just for self protection purposes. And then of course there's the hunting issue. So. <SEP> Sure. Yeah. That's good. What do you do Jeff? Uh I I'm in uh program control for a company up here. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. All right. We do schedules for programs schedule programs. Yeah. <SEP> What do you do? I'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here. Oh okay. So uh. Yeah. You guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything. Or. <SEP> Uh I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here. I don't own a shotgun. But I'd like to go bird hunting. Yeah. You know that's something I miss quite a bit. So. <SEP> Yeah. Uh when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting you you know quite a bit. Yeah. But. Yeah. All right. Yeah. My brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit. But I don't know. I guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh for a complete. <SEP> One for a total ban and uh. That's right. I guess I am about eight or nine. <SEP> Yeah. I I agree with you there. Yeah. No doubt about it. But uh. I mean if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't. Yeah. <SEP> I you know I'm not for it. Yeah. If there's if there's a way you know to limited it to people that I don't know that. They I guess they passed a couple of uh uh laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then they actually uh. I know it's this way in Florida. They have a waiting period where you buy one. And that's a week. Uh-huh. And then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that. I think that's a pretty good idea. Uh and that's. I don't know. That's not a bad idea. But then again you can always get around that. You could go through the black market like you say. You know you always be able to get around. But uh. <SEP> Sure. Yeah. It's one of things. But uh I don't know. I guess I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon. Yeah. I don't either. Yeah. I'm just not. I think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway. <SEP> Yeah. I. There. Fully auto. But even well I mean a semiautomatic I guess that's. It kind of takes the sport out of hunting. <SEP> Yeah. Right. You know it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve. Sure. You know you might do the same thing. <SEP> Right. And so it's like I don't know. It does. It takes the sport out of it. For me I would much rather have a bow anytime. Oh really. I I like bows. You know I have done some bow hunting. And I uh I get into it. And I think it's more of a challenge you know. <SEP> Yeah. But uh I don't know. I guess it keeps the shell makers in business. Sure. But uh I don't know. Anyway that's about where I stand. <SEP> Me too. You uh. Yeah. I am about the same way. And you uh have you eaten yet or whatever. <SEP> Yeah. Is it seven o'clock there? Uh yeah. It's about seven fifteen. You guys central? <SEP> How is the weather up there? Oh it's not too good. It's kind of rainy actually. Is it? Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh I don't know ten or twenty degrees. <SEP> Right. And it's been up around forty. So people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature. Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that. So. Yeah. I am just up here for the year. And it's kind of shocking.
