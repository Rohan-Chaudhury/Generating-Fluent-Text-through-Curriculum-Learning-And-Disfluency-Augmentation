So how do you get most of your current event information? Well see I'm going to school right now. And uh while I'm working I don't get a I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I don't watch T V as much really either because uh my free time is kind of. And I do like to do other stuff with it. Right. While I'm at work sometimes I on the computer network um I read the news sometimes. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's kind of helpful. I would imagine going to college though your professors and different things. You keep up on what's going on. That's true. I mean my roommates and stuff you know people around me talk about it. Yeah. <SEP> And the people I work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff. So. Right. Well I'm a housewife. I have three kids. And so um I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um talking with people and just hearing what's going on. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Do you watch do you watch the network like major network news. Or do you watch like the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR? Just the regular channel just channel eight. <SEP> Oh really. That's our channel here. That's the um eyewitness news. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. Oh ch- see channel where I am channel eight's um like public T V. So it's kind of different. Oh uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> I think I think the uh. I think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on. But um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news. Right. And I think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not. And basically you know if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will you know kind of publicize his name. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Exactly. I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on. Uh-huh. Because they can they can only report on I mean. They give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it. Right. <SEP> Right. And the news too it just doesn't um cover that many stories. I mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff. Yeah. But other than that you really don't know what's going on. <SEP> Yeah. Um I will read our current letters that come out on elections. And I guess I do read that. And I do study who's running in our area. And I do study what's going on in the economy. It you know. And I guess I do read other magazines um too to get my information. What kind of see. I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS. And that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of or like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that I wouldn't know about. Right. <SEP> But other than that I don't really read. I don't I don't really subscribe to anything else. I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST. Uh-huh. But um now I guess I just have friends that clip articles. Or if I you know am interested in something of course during the w- when we were in war I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on. <SEP> Oh yeah. But a lot of the times I you know I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper. But I just can't seem to find the time. Yeah. If they put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things. <SEP> Yeah. But. <SEP> Well I remember back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on because that they were going constantly with that stuff. Right. But uh. Well I um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of. And people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news. You know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas. <SEP> Yeah. That we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information. If they reported every if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour. Yeah. <SEP> But uh. Well I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics. Oh yeah. That's. They start already they're having like um. In the newspaper they have a section I think every now and then on the Olympics you know. And they've got like a countdown. It's like sixteen hundred days or something. I know we're trying to get tickets to it right now. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. That's going to be crazy that time of year here. <SEP> But uh. Yeah. I can't believe I mean. They're they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over. I guess people want to hear about it. Also big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh they're in you know tr- spring training or whatever. Right. Right. <SEP> And they did so well last year. Yeah. They spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports. And I think that um that's fine I would like to see more time spent on other things. Yeah. But. <SEP> It seems like. I don't know. They way they do the newscasts I wish they they kind of separated it you know. If you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it. But I don't have cable.
