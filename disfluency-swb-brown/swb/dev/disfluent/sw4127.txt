Okay. Okay. I thought it was supposed to give a recording. But anyway uh well I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for for my wife and for me. And uh I embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial. <SEP> Uh-huh. All we all I do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month. But I doubt I do it more than three times a year. Uh-huh. Do you use a computer? And. <SEP> No. I work with them all day. I'm in computer science. Yet I I do everything on paper. Oh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers. Yeah. Mine is really simple because I got all our bills paid off when uh he was a Marine. He went to Saudi Arabia. And while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off. So really the only bills I have is rent utilities insurance you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> So they come in. I pay them. And that's it you know. That's about the extent of it you know. Yeah. That. I don't really have this major budget or anything. I just really I'm real thrifty. I take care of you know two children and me and uh just real careful with the money you know. What little we have. Uh-huh. <SEP> So that's what I do. Yes. It's pretty straightforward. It's almo-. I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know fancy budgets. No. It seems like if you're getting to that level y- you're not in real good control. <SEP> Uh-uh. You know I mean I I I've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know. Uh-huh. You buy something on credit. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you pay twice as much for it when you get done. You know. Yeah. So. Actually I mean I like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month. I don't have too many I don't have too many weaknesses. <SEP> But I found out a credit card was one of them. You know. Uh. <SEP> It's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person. It's like oh it's on sale. Let's go grab it you know. So uh and if you don't have the money then use a credit card. So I got rid of them credit cards. You know. Yeah I guess if that's if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do. <SEP> Yeah. That was my weakness. It wasn't bad. I mean I didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that. Just I just learned that that wasn't for me you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sure. So but I self-employed you know. I have my own little cleaning business type thing. So uh I keep. Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that. Or. <SEP> No. It's not hard. I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and uh you know what it's going to have to go for that month. And you know it's not that not that hard. Not at all. Uh-huh. Well that's good to know. <SEP> So I always do my own income tax you know. Yeah. Do you? I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it. <SEP> Huh? It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it. R-. All you got to do is read a book I mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go. I. <SEP> Yeah. Just the form. Yeah. <SEP> I mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to. Yeah. And a lot of them. It's dumb. I guess if you had some really complicated stuff. But I don't. So I don't mess with it. Yeah. <SEP> But I don't use a calculator either you know. I I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer y- too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that that I I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on. I don't I don't have that mu- that many you know things to add up. So. I know too many people who use a calculator. If they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention. <SEP> Oh yeah. And And it seem. And we have a. <SEP> I bank at N C N B here. And they have a number that you can call in. And I always call in and like once every other week or so. And I will uh check off what checks have cleared. And. Yeah. Do you do that? We have the same thing. <SEP> You do too? Yeah. And I always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because I always want to know exactly what I have you know. Sure. <SEP> I do that real often. I do that. So anyway.
