Uh-huh. Hey Steve. Uh They just uh they just started a recycling program here I think. Actually this is my first experience with recycling program. But uh instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about uh I am starting to split stu- split stuff up. The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb. They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there. What are they doing up there? Well here in Saskatoon uh much the same thing. There is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products. Uh we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people. Uh there are areas where we could uh. Actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers. So uh we are able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing. And then there are there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers. Well primarily soft drink bottles. And so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers. And then they recycle the containers. They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container. And then. <SEP> The the deposit's only on like drink stuff. Right. Okay. On the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing. <SEP> Okay. And uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers. Uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well. Oh okay. And actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those. So uh it's fairly fairly extensive. But then again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city. <SEP> So did they. You're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group. And the handicapped group is getting the uh the money. Or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you. Well actually there's there's the opportunity for both. Oh. Okay. Generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that. Actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back. And then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit. And then I and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well. <SEP> That's very cool. You know there's a I heard about a similar program in New York City where uh a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that. But what they do is employ uh homeless I think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans. And and I think it's mostly cans. There may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not. And they uh bring them up to a one lo- one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and get more money to these people that desperately need it. Oh yeah. Uh I guess partly because of our climate. Here in Saskatoon at least the majority of central uh. Well I want to say Central Canada. But Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec. Yeah. But uh we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people. We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfa- welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing. Uh there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although uh scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds uh regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes. <SEP> Do they do it with news papers as well? They have done it some uh. But we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers. They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers. Like the shopping malls. There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects. Or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins. And then the bins are collected. Huh. Uh some of the.
