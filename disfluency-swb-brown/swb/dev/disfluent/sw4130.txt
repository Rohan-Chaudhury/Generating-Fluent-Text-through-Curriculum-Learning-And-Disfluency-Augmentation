So Julie how do you feel about AIDS research? I think we need we definitely need more of it definitely. I'd agree too. But I mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know uh you know. It would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research than a l- l- longer ago. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. For certain. You know because you know because uh the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients. Exactly. Uh-huh. <SEP> Exactly. Does does like d- do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover diseases like that? I think they cover AIDS. But what they do is uh if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they'll uh check to see if you're H I V positive. Uh-huh. And if you are not only will they not give you uh a policy. But they'll uh they have like. There's like you know a database of people that have tested positive. So you'll never be able to get insurance ever again. <SEP> Um well that's but that's why they should have s- started doing stuff before. I mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now. You know. Yeah. I think a lot of it was was just that you know becau- because of of the audi- you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about. <SEP> Right. Right. That. <SEP> Right. And all these God-fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh yeah. One one one h- one humorous retort I heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know God's punishment was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people. <SEP> Uh. Yeah. But uh. <SEP> Boy. That's a good one. So uh. <SEP> Yes? Uh do you think d- you mean do you actually think we're doing enough right now to. No. I really don't. I did I did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff. And uh really we're not doing much at all. I mean most of what gets raised I mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by uh uh you know conscious yeah communities and things like that you know. Private organizations. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like uh San Francisco has a a real uh strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff. And and uh get they get donations from the community you know they're real And from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean it seems that you know it's just you know of it's just going to reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we'd nip it in the bud to q- quote Barney Fife. Right. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I I I don't know what the likelihood of that is. But I mean you know people really waking up. Uh-huh. <SEP> Especially with the ultra conservatives move our our political system s- sort of seems to be taking. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I would probably agree with that. <SEP> Yeah. So. Uh so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of uh people? God. That's a good question Fish. I don't know. Uh I think I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it's really it's really not necessary uh until until the disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely cut off from from the community. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that and uh I don't know. I guess I think that that uh research is I guess the most important just because I you know it it really needs to come to an end. You know. Uh-huh. I don't know. I don't know Fish. What do you think about that subject? I think it's I think it stands a really interesting question of uh.
