I don't believe that we're. So what do you think about uh recycling programs in Atlanta Julie? The recycling program here is just terrible. I mean it's hard to find places to go. I mean Kroger does a couple things. They I don't think they do they do newspapers? <SEP> I don't know. There's there's big bins out there. I don't know if they ever get. I I really don't know what the details are. There should be someplace where you could call and find out. As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you. But I think there should be some kind of curbside service. Yeah. That's the only way I could really. The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff. <SEP> Uh-huh. They pick up everything. During the summers like the around where I live the uh homeless people see-. I mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff. Uh-huh. And so we used to just save them up. And then they'd come around. And we'd give them to them. Uh-huh. <SEP> But when. During the winter time I think they they move south or something. Yeah. So I don't do that anymore. And the the recycling at Georgia Tech like that uh outside the uh student center they never empty those things. Uh-huh. <SEP> I know it. I know it. They just overflow. It piles up. <SEP> So what's a guy to do? You know. I asked myself. <SEP> I just don't know. I just don't know. And now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center. You can't really unload all your stuff. <SEP> Really? Huh oh yeah. That's true. Hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient. Uh-huh. Inconvenient even. I know it. I know it. <SEP> But uh. So you do recycle don't you? Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm kind of I'm kind of bad about it. The. <SEP> If I if see a s- if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there. Uh-huh. But I don't really I don't ever take anything. Well I mean it's real. You ought to because the the the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything. <SEP> Uh-huh. And since we go there all the time I mean. But wait. Probably at all. <SEP> I've never seen you before. Who are you? Oh by the way may name's Julie. <SEP> Yeah. My name's Bill. Well. Hi. Hi. I'm from Atlanta. <SEP> Me too. Neat. Crazy. <SEP> Uh well is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie? I just think that everybody ought to do it. Do they do. Like what about like uh. What kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know? The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs. <SEP> Really? Yeah. What about like those grocery bags? Oh yeah. They have uh. Uh what I what I used to uh. Now that I don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot. But I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. A- but also most places like Big Star does. And I'm not sure if Kroger does or not. But. <SEP> They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic. Yeah. And they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in. Uh. Can bring them in. <SEP> Those petroleum products are going to kill us. I know it. I know it. The hostile planet I think Julie. <SEP> It really is a small hostile planet. <SEP> The petroleum pretty much I mean those petroleum products I think are the big uh you know the great Satan of the recycling. Did you know that. No. Really not. Did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper. <SEP> Um. Paper just seems so innocuous. Huh? <SEP> Paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know. Well it is it is though. It comes from trees. How can it be bad? It is because they. <SEP> They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it. Well they do treat paper with chemicals. Like yellow paper you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose. Yep. <SEP> Oh. You know you can bury a piece of yellow paper. It will still be there in a couple of weeks. Really? Yeah. <SEP> Huh. It will be whole. You'll be able to read off of it. I'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads then. <SEP> Yeah um. I'm glad you told me that because I use those at work where I work. And uh But I can just forget that from now on. <SEP> W-. I'm going u- I'm going to switch to the white ones. Well white paper's bad too. They they treat it too. <SEP> Well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bam- you know bamboo stuff from the from the banks of the Nile. I'm sure that's fine. I'm sure. <SEP> Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again. You think so? Maybe. <SEP> Tablets? Yeah. I think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether you know. You think? <SEP> I don't know. Well I mean I think we've kind of you know. What do you think? I mean everybody everybody everybody has a computer. <SEP> Kind of radical I know. But. We would no longer need paper at all. <SEP> That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist like uh Dick Tracy. <SEP> I would love that.
