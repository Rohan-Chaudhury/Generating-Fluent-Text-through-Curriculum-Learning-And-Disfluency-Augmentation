Wendy I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh. Right. Let me ask you the question. Do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to? <SEP> Right now I'm in college. And I'm on work study. Uh-huh. And so my budget comes from my dad's help. Uh-huh. <SEP> He helps me out a lot. And I get paid monthly. So that's kind of hard to have a budget. My mother uh doesn't get paid much money. So her budget is uh just uh planning for I R A's. I see. I see. Well good. I'm kind of in a different situation. But I I I went through that too when I was in school. But uh I was I was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that. But uh I'm married and have uh a a couple of children. And we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm on a salary. So I don't get any overtime or anything like that. But We have a fixed income. Oh. And we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have will is spent accordingly. And uh what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment. <SEP> Uh-huh. We have the insurance premiums uh utilities and so forth. And we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside. And we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll- the kids' education college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds. Uh-huh. And and we also set aside an emergency fund. Because we've uh we've been married for about ten years. <SEP> That sounds good. And we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh not enough to go and to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for. Right. <SEP> Right. And uh then we have you know. Whatever's left over is disposable in- disposable dis- yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month. So and it's worked out very well. It's uh it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that. <SEP> Well that's good. And nice thing about it I my wife is is excellent in that we both work together. We both have a budget. And we stick to it. Well good. And there's no surprises in that. <SEP> With two kids that could be hard. Well actually I have four kids. Four !. So. Yeah. I said a couple of kids. I I guess I should have specified. I have four four little boys. <SEP> Oh my goodness. Yeah. Four boys. You bet. <SEP> Oh my goodne-. You bet. It's just me and my sister. All right. <SEP> And my parents divorced three years ago. Uh-huh. And my sister had gotten through college. But I was still in high school. And my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together. Yes. <SEP> And then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college. Uh-huh. But uh when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house. Oh. <SEP> So now my dad's paying for all of my college of. Well good. Good. And financial aid and scholarships. Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm a music major. So I have auditions coming up. Yes. Well what year are you in in college? I'm a sophomore. You're a sophomore. So you have a few more years. <SEP> Right. Right. I'll I'll probably have about two two and a half years left. Uh-huh. Well good for you. Good for you. Yeah. I imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that during school and so it forth. Oh it sure is. I I know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks. Yes. <SEP> And I and I don't spend over that. Well great. Great. And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too. Oh sure. There's there's always music books to buy. Lab fees and all. <SEP> Oh yes. Oh yes. Well you're not a starving artist yet are you? Oh no. No. No. Good. <SEP> I don't plan on being a starving artist. Well good. That's why I'm in college. The- there's enough of those in the world huh? <SEP> Right. Good. Good. I'm glad to hear that Wendy. W-. That's usually because they're not real educated. They can't afford to have a really good job. Who's who's not very well educated? <SEP> The starving ones. Oh yes. Yes. There's enough out there that if you have if you're educated enough then you can make money. That's true. That's true. I found that out. <SEP> So that's why I'm planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also try and set that money aside. Right. <SEP> What did you major in? I majored in business administration. Well good. You know plenty about planning a b- a budget. Yeah. But uh once again.
