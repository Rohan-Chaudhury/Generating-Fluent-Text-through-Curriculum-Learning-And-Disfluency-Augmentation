How do you feel about gun control? Well uh I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed. Um. <SEP> But it's going to. A lot of the stuff that. I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago But I don't really know I mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh prevent that. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well don't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry. I mean It varies from State to State. Yeah. That. Well do you even know what the procedures are now? <SEP> Um. There is no national. But it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it. Uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or uh you know other obvious things like that. <SEP> Yeah. Uh and I know I know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know be be obviously insane. And then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun. Huh. I didn't know that. Well that's pretty scary. So does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten. Uh yeah. I'd probably I'd probably say about a five. <SEP> That's where I would probably be. Seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know. Well I mean I mean I don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better. Uh-huh. <SEP> Because I mean I do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff. Uh-huh. And I can understand them wanting to have them. But then again it's just like all those nuts out there. Well you know uh uh no-. If you are looking at like you know country that uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know. The amount of violent crime has decreased by so much. <SEP> It has? Because then. Well I mean yeah. The uh the. In comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States. Um. Uh you know I mean the problem though you know they if the since the United States had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already. <SEP> Yeah. You know so it's it's really kind of a complex problem. Well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta? Uh I'm not really sure how bad it is. I've I've not really had that many problems with it. But I mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up. <SEP> Yeah. I know Dallas is. Uh. I mean I think you know in the te-. I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years. I don't know if Dallas is in the top three. Uh-huh. <SEP> But. Do you own a gun? No. I've thought about getting one. If I get one I think I will probably you know get something. I probably wouldn't get a hand gun. I would probably get like a shotgun. Just for protecting myself. You know from burglar type thing. Uh-huh. I do kind of live in the downtown area. <SEP> Yeah. You know and shotguns are really good because they're. I mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know. That's true. Uh and you know you. Yeah. I just don't understand these people you know like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves. They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know. They are probably going to miss the person. And and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know. <SEP> I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon. You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever. Yeah. <SEP> Well Well now when I first moved to Dallas I moved up here by myself. You pretty much stop them. And you don't. Then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much. And uh my Dad gave me a gun. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it. Uh-huh. So I finally ended up giving it back to him. I said I don't want it. I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn I don't need it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. That that really does scare me. People you know that have guns. Because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot. But you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you. Yeah. <SEP> And they get it from you. And you know you're pretty much dead you know. Because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then You know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Set them off. And and well I mean you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you are a real danger to them. And then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you. Yeah. Well that's why I ended up giving it back to him. I thought well you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to oper- you know if I don't really know how to use it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I just didn't want the responsibility. Um. <SEP> So. Well uh did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever? Yeah. The did it happen at a cafeteria or something? Yeah. Right. That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns. Uh-huh. <SEP> I would be scared selling guns to people.
