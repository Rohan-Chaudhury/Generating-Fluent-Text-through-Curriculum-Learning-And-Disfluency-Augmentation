Hello. I pressed the button one. So we're recording right now. I'm sorry. That's okay. I'm Bill from Raleigh. <SEP> Okay. And I'm Melanie from Harrisville Utah. Oh another one from a different state besides Texas. Yeah. Um okay. Bill we're talking about family reunions. Right. <SEP> Okay um. Have you ever had to plan a family reunion? Uh yes. And no. It wasn't really a fa- a planning one. But it was kind of uh it was a birthday. Oh. And I brought a lot of family together then. <SEP> Uh-huh. And how did you feel it went? It went pretty good. I'm I've worked in hotels. So I I kind of know how to do these things. Oh. I used to you know. <SEP> All this planning and and getting together and such. Um oh let's see what else. Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday. And and it's all of like she she comes from a big family. Uh-huh. She has like seven sisters I think. <SEP> Oh boy. They show up and all their kids. And then all she has uh. I have like uh. Let's see. She has four sons and two daughters. And they show up and all their kids. Uh-huh. So it's a pretty big reunion. It's about two hundred people maybe. <SEP> Oh my word. Well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together? Um the probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh. Uh-huh. I guess probably the most helpful thing was that um for the rent we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that. <SEP> Oh. Uh-huh. And uh each one of the everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks. And and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill. <SEP> Oh. Oh that's good. And each person in the family you know brought a dish or something. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then did you have a main meal. Or did everyone just bring. It was just pot luck. It was kind of pot luck. Uh-huh. You know everybody brought their specialties I guess you would say. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Show off a little bit. Yeah. And of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook. Oh. <SEP> Oh. Now how old is she? Uh she's eighty-six. Oh goodness. Is she pretty spry is she you know pretty. Now she does. She looks probably like she's in her early sixties. <SEP> Oh wow. And if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh. Oh that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age. Yeah. Oh yeah. My nickname for her is Honey Woman. That's what I call her. Really. Well that sounds fun. Well I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago. And there were. We sent out five hundred uh announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there. And so that was a real challenge. And I was president of our family reunion for two years. And I wasn't very at that duty for two years in a row. But I found that advance planning was the key to success. Uh also one thing that's helpful. And I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever. <SEP> Uh-huh. But most of all my family lives like in the same county. So. Oh that's wonderful though. But it's just kind of like get on the telephone. And it's so and such days from such and such date. <SEP> Oh. And everybody just shows up. <SEP> Oh well that is that is helpful. Yeah. Our family ranges from oh goodness well Australia. I have a brother lives in Australia to uh Boise Idaho and and uh all kinds of places. I would say you're spread out then. We are. Uh my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever. Because my dad was in the Army. And we're we're pretty strung out all over. <SEP> Oh. But since they've moved back to Carolinas we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County. In. <SEP> Oh. I live in Raleigh. And then my my parents live in Greenville. And I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and uh another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville. Uh-huh. So I mean we're we're spread out. But everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro. <SEP> Boy. So. Oh my gosh. Nobody moves away except us. <SEP> They must really like it there. Yeah. I got out as soon as I graduated. Yeah. Oh. Just like this town is too small for me. Good-bye. <SEP> Oh you're ready to move on to bi-.
