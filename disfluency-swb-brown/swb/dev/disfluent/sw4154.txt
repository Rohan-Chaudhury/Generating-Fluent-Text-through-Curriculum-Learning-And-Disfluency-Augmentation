Well what do you feel about the um present situation in the Mideast? Well it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is. Uh-huh. <SEP> What do you think Mark? Yeah. I agree. I think I think there's definitely been some changes um. And I think you know the the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on on the situation. Oh yeah. Um you know in that there's there's not you kno- there you know i- you know. Basically since the end of World War two there was always you know that little proxy war going on. You know with um the U S funding Israel and and the um Soviet Union funding the Arab countries. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much. Or supplied with arms the same way. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. But on the same token you know Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the U S in being you know the foothold of capitalism. You know in in the Mideast. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well I we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves. Uh-huh. You know we s- kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh Kuwait was uh the fact that they did not retaliate for the uh scud missiles that were uh launched there. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> That just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint. And it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the U S. Uh-huh. Yeah. But on the other hand you know if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes. I see. They basically would have you know had a had a f- they had they would have had had to fly through you know two enemies. <SEP> Oh you don't think they got the codes from the U S already? The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them. I see. I mean of course you know public statements can be taken for. <SEP> That's true. They can yet they. Uh-huh. Yeah. D-. <SEP> Well what do y-. What about this situation with the you know the uh continual uh harassment by Iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the uh arms inspectors have free access. Uh-huh. You know well to begin with you know. I pretty much question or what what the U S -s motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement. Uh-huh. Uh I. The cynical side of me says that you know it was more for uh the the domestic political situation than for anything else. You know and that you know and for portraying Bush is a strong President. <SEP> Huh yeah. Okay. Sure. Uh I mean I really I really think that that my gut feeling is that that you know he pretty much picked picked the fight with uh with um Hussein. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean I'm not not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to ge- enter that fight. Right. But you know I think I think that that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt. <SEP> Uh-huh. Where a lot w-. Well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh you know move on into Kuwait and see what happens? <SEP> I think I mean I thought I think that um in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen. Uh-huh. And I I really don't I really don't think that. I think I think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests. <SEP> Right. Um. Yeah. Well may have been. You know I'm not saying that that's not the case. Uh. Yeah. And I mean in in in along this line since since you know it it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting uh the Iraqis out of Kuwait. <SEP> Right. I just don't I just don't I I I d- I I I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle. No. Um you know over over the uh over over what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically. <SEP> No. It doesn't look like we're getting ready to do to do much more in there. Uh-huh. Even at this point. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Well what about uh. Do you have any any views on uh Israel's relation to the U S? Do you think we ought to you know back off on our support of the country. <SEP> Or what do yo-. Well I have I have very fixed feelings about Israel. Um I think that that for a long while we've we've had almost a you know ha- t-.
