Okay um Chuck do you have any pets there at your home? Yeah I do. And what kind do you have? <SEP> I've got a male Siamese about a year old here. I live alone in an apartment and uh except for the cat. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> How about you? Well we have a cat um. He's probably oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby. Uh-huh. Oh. Uh how's the disposition of your Siamese cat? <SEP> Well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature. Uh-huh. And uh he's been neutered and declawed. So he's an indoor cat. Uh-huh. <SEP> So uh that kind of calms him down for the most part. How about yours? Well yeah. He's uh he has been really aggressive uh especially towards my little girl for some reason. <SEP> Huh. He's uh been so mean to her. And and you say you've had him how long? We've had him for about two years. <SEP> Two years. And he was so mean to her um right after we first got him. So we had him neutered and and declawed. And now he bites her. He can't scratch her any more. Huh. He bites her. <SEP> Does he bite her enough to draw blood? Yeah. Yeah. He has a couple of times. So. Uh-huh. But he's a very possessive cat. He he loves my son. It's his cat. And he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him. <SEP> Yeah. And he's so funny. He just follows my son around just like a dog. Huh. He won't even let my son shower. <SEP> Yeah. He meows and wants to get in the bathroom. And while he showers it's so hilarious. So he's quite a animal. Yeah. Boy. I guess. Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right. Yeah. <SEP> You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something. Yeah. Well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sure. But uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit. And we do keep our daughter away from him. So. Yeah. Yeah. Were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house. <SEP> Is that the only pet that you have? It is. Uh-huh. We we tried a dog about four years ago and we ended up with uh oh malamute and some other kind of mix. Anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home. So we gave him up and tried. Well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh. Yes. Uh-huh. We're in a house. But we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog. <SEP> I see. We couldn't allow him to run free. So he was just chained up all the time. And it was it was unfortunate. Sure. So have you tried any other pets? <SEP> No. No. I I live alone in an apartment. And uh it's it's not that big that uh. Oh. Although I've heard rabbits are pretty good. Oh. <SEP> You know I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses. Uh-huh. Oh my word. <SEP> And they apparently uh. Especially when they're young when they bring them in. Oh my word. Uh. And do they they just paper train it or something? <SEP> I guess. I guess. Yeah. And I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either. Yeah. Well rabbits are darling. That would be fun if you could get them trained. Otherwise they're pretty smelly. <SEP> Yep. That's right. Oh. Did you see the the C N N the the dog show uh. Huh-uh. We don't have C we don't have cable. <SEP> I see. Well they have uh uh a Wesmin- they call it the Westminster Dog Show uh. I think it's in New York City at the at the Gardens. There once a year live. Oh. And they had that on last week. And that's really kind of something to watch uh. Oh. <SEP> It's on I think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two. Is that right? And some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there. Oh. <SEP> Some of them are really beautiful too. Uh-huh. So. Well I'd be interesting to watch. <SEP> So you live in Utah do you? Yes. Uh-huh. Elton. Goodness. We live out here by it's by Ogden. It's north of Salt Lake City Utah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we really love it out here. It's uh kind of country. We're we're only about ten minutes from Ogden. Uh-huh. So we're kind of country but not too. <SEP> Well do you all work for T I or for. No. Huh-uh. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh well see I'm getting so many calls to Texas. <SEP> This is the very first one I've I've talked to. Oh well great. Yeah. I've been doing it for about two weeks. And uh no my No my. Uh-huh.
