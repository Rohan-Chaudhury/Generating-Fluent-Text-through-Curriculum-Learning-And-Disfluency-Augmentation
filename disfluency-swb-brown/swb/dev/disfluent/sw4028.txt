Okay. Um I guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits. And so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits? Uh I would say the medical uh group insurance area as far as uh covering medical costs for yourself or family members. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard? Yeah. I think. I work for a public school system district. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing. Where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs. Oh yeah. But overall um I've been pleased with it over the years. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies. Or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any. Uh-huh. I see. <SEP> How about yourself? Uh well I'm. My medical coverage is with an H M O. Uh-huh. Um so that's in my opinion that's get- that's bordering on a health clinic. But it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Um. Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year or calendar years. And I was in the H M O. And um I was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh. They usually sign a contract or something. Uh-huh. <SEP> And um uh I did have surgery last summer. And I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day. And I've never seen another bill. So I I have to say it really works. Right. But again I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it. Uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people. Yes. <SEP> That's right. Yeah. I'm I'm fairly young myself. I've only been. When I first started working which. Three years ago is when I first got into full time employment. Uh-huh. And uh at that time I immediately joined the H M O. And I never really. So the only doctor I I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O. And uh you know for me it's worked out real good. <SEP> Yeah. Right. But if you you know have a family and and um everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history. And you feel comfortable with it. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I'm sure it would be very stressful. And my husband and I have just elected that if that happens I will go and just pay. You can continue to go to your own doctor. Uh-huh. But your benefits are not as you know good. So uh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Um like you you mentioned you work for a school system. I work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch. <SEP> Oh all right. And I guess another one that that I rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um I enjoy as a benefit. I do too. Are you talking about like Spring Break. And. Right. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation. Right. <SEP> It it really um. I don't think most of our teachers. Now I'm not a teacher. I am a secretarial executive assistant. But I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly. Uh-huh. It is just Texas has really um you know. They want everybody educated no matter what it costs. Uh and it it would be just. We all look forward to. Like in two weeks we have Spring Break. And I don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. What do you do there? Well um I'm not actually on the teaching faculty. But we have a large research organization associated with the university. And that's who I work with. <SEP> Okay. Um and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do. We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study. Well that's good. Yeah. I would think that that type of employment you're you're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little luke warm or something. Right. <SEP> And um it's good that they allow you that. Right. It um. As I say the schools. Now we do have to work you know the day. But we do get many days off. And uh we all look forward to it. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's the only reason I work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college. But at the time I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs. Oh yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I've just continued to uh stay there. Are there are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits?
