Okay. Well um I used to work in a day care center. Uh-huh. I worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center. And it is they can be deceiving to people. I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got. And this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers all over you know the um city. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left. Yeah. So um I think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when they're not expecting it. <SEP> Yeah. Because they do do things differently when you're not around. So. Well that. I know wh-. The things that we kind of looked at is is you want to see how many teachers you have. And and how many kids they have and how they break it up. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in. Uh-huh. <SEP> It it was a really good one. And in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered. My wife did artwork for them. And then you know so we got our day care free. Uh-huh. But they didn't have enough teachers. And. Well this one was set up good. I mean they had two teachers to every room. Um sometimes three. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool. Uh-huh. The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough. They did not show them care to these small children who are being left. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um they. One time I picked up this little boy who was crying. And the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. You know. Huh. He said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up. <SEP> And I said no. This child was crying and needed some comfort you know. Yeah. What is your problem. So um. <SEP> Did did they separate them by age group? Yes. Because I'd think you know I think that's one thing that was important. Right. They did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room. <SEP> Uh-huh. Then they had like the um three three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives. You know just like that. Yeah. You know they really did separate them well. <SEP> I- it sound. Yeah. It was just the teachers themselves. It sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people. Affectionate people that they're they're kind of par- may be parents themselves or something. Right. <SEP> But. Yeah. That they're not. Yeah. Their system. <SEP> Right. But their but their system was was great. But um the you know the caring just wasn't there. Uh-huh. The one woman that taught that did the babies. I worked with her. And she was fabulous. <SEP> Uh-huh. She loved them babies. And she loved them and cared for them. But um every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and um you know would make me a nervous wreck. So you know. Yeah. I I I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff. But if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good. Yeah. These kids are just in a day care center all day and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care. <SEP> Yeah. They're just there. You know. Going through this routine which is lousy. Yeah. <SEP> An-. The other the other group that we had was kind of interesting. The other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we knew them from other associations. But uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one. And I think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know. But he was actually the more um the more uh what demonstrative type. The more loving. Uh-huh. He would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids. And and i- it was kind of interesting to see that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it. Uh-huh. <SEP> An-. Yeah. You don't see that much. Yeah. So they had a really nice balance. We liked that one. In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something. That's cute. <SEP> But they also did they also did some of the teaching things. And then they had um you know. Obedience obedience was important. Yeah. That has to be with a day care center. And you know so they you know they used uh oh I think they used the. You probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself. I've never heard of that. That's that's a new one on me. <SEP> And it's it's one. Uh I can't remember what they call it actually. But y- you just stand them in front of a clock. And you know it has a second-hand that goes around. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they have to stand there.
