So how you like New Jersey? Uh it's pretty good you know. You get uh closer to the uh coast here. And you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants. Right. I guess uh I don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but I guess it's uh fairly industrial? <SEP> Yeah. It's. When you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial. Right uh-huh. But I'm I'm about uh thirty miles west of there. So you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that that other part of New Jersey exists. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Right. <SEP> Actually very. Y- you know you go even a few wi- miles out and you got uh farms and everything. So you relatively clear air. Right. <SEP> But uh. Well I don't know about you. But I've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor. I mean there's a lot of contributors. But it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that. Oh d- definitely. It's. Yeah. <SEP> Uh you know there are a large number of them on the road. They're all you know going. And a lot of them are in relatively poor repair. That's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know. A lot of states don't have a uh inspection law. So you get you get a lot of people out there without E T R emission control systems on their cars and things like that. Oh e- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year. Yeah. And it's like. <SEP> You get the car that's in the accident. And muffler falls off or something. Sure. And guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that. Right. I guess from what I hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars. They're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California. <SEP> Yeah. That. And I think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets so you. Yeah. Natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline. Right. I hope I I'm hoping that comes along quick. Uh I was reading a an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going. And I guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize. And I know that's not due to uh it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the C F C -s. But. <SEP> It it is coming from cars though. Uh yeah. I think that's a that's a contributor definitely. I mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon. Which is one of the major flor- chlorofar- fluorocarbons. Right. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because I guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production. But it. <SEP> Well it it. Go ahead. No. It's it's the type of thing there that uh you know. The Third World countries are less industrial. And they want to become industrial. Uh-huh. <SEP> So they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S. The U S used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today. Right. And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense. Uh in terms of. Or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to. Exactly. <SEP> Exactly. Uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments. But uh I don't know. That's that's kind of an interesting situation there. Uh what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting. I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles. And it's it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places. Yeah. So it's kind of an interesting situation. It's not not a real good one actually. <SEP> No. But. Well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. You don't get that that source of cleansing anymore. Are have you been in big cities a long time? <SEP> Mostly I've mostly been in the east coast. So that's going between Atlanta Washing- D C area. Okay. So you've got. A-. Yeah. Those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard I would think. <SEP> Well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the inversion and Los Angeles and a- rest of California which is just terrible it sounds. Yeah. Denver's definitely. Yeah. That's one of the worst. <SEP> Sure. Yeah. Denver's that that real good e- that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does I guess. Uh-huh. Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the in the world for that. <SEP> Yeah. But I've been pretty lucky. I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh I'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida. And there you can tell that it's getting worse. I mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver. But you can. Yeah. There it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it. Exactly. <SEP> Yeah. And there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there. Uh-huh. There is. But it's kind of it's.
