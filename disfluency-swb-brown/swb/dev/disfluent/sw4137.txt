Let's see. Mine's pretty easy actually. Uh I just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns. Uh-huh. Uh and although I can't afford it right now I would just like love to have one. <SEP> Oh really. You like uh. So you're an American. Well. You want to buy American. No. Regardless of that fact. It's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money. I'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing. <SEP> Um. And uh it seems to just blow the com- compe- competition away. It terms of handling uh acceleration. Handling power everything. Yeah. It just got like the top rating. It was compared up against uh. Let's see. There was like the Mazda M X three uh Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand the Civic S I. And it just you know it it dominated over all of them. Everybody all the uh raters loved it. I like the I like the styling. And I seen a few of them actually race. And they seem to be really good cars for it. <SEP> What about Mustang G T -s? Mustang G T -s? Uh can't afford it. Those. So you're talking about ones in a lower lower end p- price range. Right. Yeah. I'm a graduate student. And let's face it. I don't make any money. So. <SEP> Right. Well you can wait till you graduate. And you'll have plenty of money. You can buy whatever you want. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. We'll see then. Yeah. Right now I'm stuck. I I've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that. It's fast but unreliable. And trying to get it prepared for racing. But it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the g- Saturn. Right. Would you use that for city driving and racing? Oh yeah. I'd do it I'd use it for both. The nice thing about autocrossing is you can you can do both. <SEP> Autocrossing is. What kind of track is that? Uh just like a uh set up a lot of times. And it's like really large uh parking lots. And pylons and things. Okay. And you put up set up the track pylons. <SEP> Okay. Tight turns hard acceleration. I've seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete. And it's interesting. They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. I would guess so. Uh what are you thinking about buying? <SEP> Uh I think I'd like to get uh B M W or if I go the German route which I'm kind of leaning towards right now but uh or maybe a Hon- I mean a a Acura Legend. Uh. The Legend. Uh. <SEP> A Lexus uh S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order. Uh-huh. I haven't really determined if I like the the Japanese or the if I like them enough to purchase one. You know because your B M W -s your German cars have good reputations I think. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well I was I was actually in uh. A lot of the B M W -s are produced in uh sh- uh Stutgardt and uh and Munich. <SEP> Yes. And I was I was there this uh summer. And uh i- I was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for B M W. The. <SEP> Yeah. They their they have the whole philosophy. I mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better which is kind of hard to take. Yeah. <SEP> I mean as you're walking through that little tour in uh Munich it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you too. Uh. Oh of course. Of course they are. They want you to buy their car. Yeah. There. It was it was interesting. I was at I I also went to uh the Porsche. And uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. The uh the B M W is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things. And everything is put together with exacting tolerances. And and then you go to Porsche. And it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade. Um. And no two of them are alike. <SEP> And. Yeah. That's. So it's like completely opposed. I don't know. Which do I like better. I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical. <SEP> No. It's not realistic. Unless it's it's a toy. Yeah. If you can afford that kind of a toy then I guess uh. Let's face it. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. But it it B M W -s good for that. What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for? Yeah. Just work. Short trips. No m- no heavy mileage. I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year. Wow yeah. <SEP> So it's pretty minimal. That's cool. Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for. Yeah. That's good. I also I was impressed by uh by the Mercedes too. <SEP> Oh yeah. I really I really like the Mercedes. But But if if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things. The factory was nice. And. <SEP> And is it different for the for the B M W? Uh I think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly. Probably. <SEP> Right. I can imagine that. So I'm kind. <SEP> Yeah. I'm not sure if I really want.
