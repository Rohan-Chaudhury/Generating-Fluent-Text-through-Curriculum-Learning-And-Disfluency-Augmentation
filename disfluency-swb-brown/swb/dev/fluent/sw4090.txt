. Are you married. And do you have a family? I am to both questions. And do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances. <SEP> We do. We. Basically there's the expenses that are fixed during the month the ones that come every month. And we enter those into a spread sheet. And whatever is left after that we sit down and agree on kind of what sort of range we are generally going to shoot for. <SEP> I see. <SEP> What do you do? That's basically what we do. About every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget. And we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest. And then we divvy them up between our four pay checks. I work part time at night. <SEP> And my husband works full times days. And so we have four checks. But that works out nice because we get paid every week. And so that does help. <SEP> That helps a lot. And then we don't have a lot extra for extra spending. So it's pretty well ear marked. <SEP> All allocated out. Every penny is ear marked. But we have found that works the best. And so if we can just divide all the major bills up. In fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half. And divide those up between all. <SEP> All the checks. And so we are not taking a huge sum out of one. And then the next pay check we're real short. Or. We found that it's definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses. <SEP> That's true. Before we started doing that kind of a thing we were spending money for things that. We kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have. <SEP> And it was easy to let things get out of hand. We thought it to be really helpful. We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that. <SEP> So. It helps you to focus where your money goes. And I am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget. But you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in. And then you're saying where did all that money go. <SEP> That's a lot of money. But. Where does it go? <SEP> But. And also we have found that if we write down. And we did this. We are not real consistent with this. But we did it for about a month. And we wrote down everything that we bought every pay check. And so we could see where every penny went. And it was really interesting to see just what you do spend. And like I say we haven't been real consistent with it. It's. We should cause it does help. <SEP> The other thing that we've found that helps is we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit. It's just to get up the money in advance and put it in so long as it wasn't unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in an envelope or whatever. <SEP> And that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount. And then if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say it's gone. Wel- just stick to that. That is. <SEP> That sounds like a really good idea. <SEP> And it really helpful. Have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet? <SEP> We haven't. Our initial goal was just to completely retire debt for car payments and credit card debt and all of that. <SEP> We are just at a point where we could start thinking about it. So. That's good. That's a good feeling. I. My husband just graduated from the university a year ago. <SEP> So finally we are getting to that point too. A student. Are you still going to school. Or. <SEP> I am actually in the mas-.
