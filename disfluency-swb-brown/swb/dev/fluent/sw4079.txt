. Frank what type of budget do you or your family have? I don't know that we really have a budget. I have a set amount that I save. Actually there is a way. Budget our money apparently. The. My wife gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks. And we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that. And besides that I have a set amount that I save every month. That's sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have. <SEP> I am single. So. I guess I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget. But I basically. <SEP> Really don't need to. I don't need to. I am the only that I have to keep track of. So it makes it a little bit easier. That's right. And also I try to save a certain amount each month as well. <SEP> And I try to have an idea of what my expenses are. And I am pretty consistent from month to month. And whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it. <SEP> I found that things as I have gotten older. I am in my fifties now. But before we use to have a very strict budget. I had four kids. And we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for this and for that. Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be. I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I kind of fence off areas of my check book. For instance there are certain things that I know come up every so often. Every six months I have to pay car insurance. Every six months I have to pay my taxes. So I take a set amount. I've got a money market account that I do a lot of saving in. And I also have got a checking account besides that. But what I do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out. And I put it in parenthesis. I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up. <SEP> Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it. Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside. And I guess that's a way of budgeting. That's. I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More medium or longer range. I just have maybe a targeted amount that I will save for. I am. Probably within a year I would like to buy a new car. <SEP> So I kind of have an amount in my mind. And I am making every effort to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever. Cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too. <SEP> We've got two cars. My wife has a car. And I like to drive pick up truck. So we are on a schedule where I try every three or four years to buy a new one. And I am constantly making car payments. But I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments. So I get one paid for. And actually I am saving up for another one besides. So it's kind of a never ending thing. <SEP> But you try to schedule those things so that you're not paying for two at the same time is what I am saying. <SEP> Have you thought about leasing? I have thought about it. But leasing wouldn't. I don't use it for my business. I see. <SEP> My wife uses hers just for pleasure. And I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away. So. But if you are rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that. <SEP> I guess. Typically if you purchase your own car you tend to make the best returns after you pay it off. <SEP> Of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself. You're right. I have been know to keep trucks or cars for ten or twelve years. But I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill. And you got to put stuff in them. That's right. Mine's seven years old. And I think last year that was a rough year for it. I had a number of expenses. <SEP> But I am hoping that most of them were just kind of. The. As you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that. So I just went through that whole set last year. I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again. <SEP> Those things can really upset your budget when they come in. It's nice to have a little bit set aside for the unexpected. So that it doesn't kill you all in one month. What line of work are you in?
