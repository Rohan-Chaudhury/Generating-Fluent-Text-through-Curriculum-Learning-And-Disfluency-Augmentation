. How about you. What do you do with your budget? What do I do. At the moment it's under chaos. Right now I'm just. I don't really have a budget per se. It's called living within your means. Which means at the moment paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse. <SEP>. That's true. But. I don't really have a budget at the moment. But I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month. And then I usually don't exceed that unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if I have car expenses. And then it goes through the moon. So. <SEP> That's sort of a problem. What do yo-. We're trying to. So far we are in the clear credit wise. But the other side of it is. So not much on that side of it to add to it. We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that. But. So you can afford to get a house? <SEP> We'd like to do that some day. We have this dream. <SEP> But we don't know how long it will be a dream. We're real happy that we don't have any debt. But at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this economy right now. So we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save the little bit that we do get on top of expenses every month. <SEP> What do you and your husband do? We're missionaries actually. Are you really? <SEP> And it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have support quota. And it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here. <SEP> And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home. I see. Overseas where would you be going? <SEP> Africa. Nigeria. How long would you be there? <SEP> About four years. We're career. So we go over seas for four years. And then we come back for a year. We go over four. We come back for a year. With what Church? We're with Wycliff Bible Translators. <SEP> I know who they are. They have an office in Costa Mesa as I recall. They could very well. And. There was a fairly large building that belongs to them. Are you active in translation? <SEP> We will be. I was over four years doing language surveying which is the first step. You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need. And came home and got married. And we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family. And it is easier to raise a family as translators. I always wanted to do translation. But as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier. They really need surveyors cause you're free to travel anywhere. You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff. True. True enough. What languages do you speak besides English of course? <SEP> I have a smattering of about ten different ones. But there's. I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other. Since I did complete a survey in one area I'd switch to the other. So I know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff. <SEP> But in about five I can do better in it. And my French is pretty good. But it's French. So I'm terrified to speak in France. In France. Because they're real snobby about their language. And French is street French. And I just picked it up off the street. And I knew what I was communicating. But I didn't know what I was saying. I never sat there and got a direct translation. And said something here when I came home and French to somebody. And he paled and said I'm not going to tell you what you said. So since then I have refrained from speaking any French. <SEP> In. I don't know what I said to him. But I didn't ask him either. Must have been terrible. The. Was it Henry Macon said that the language was like a man slowly bleeding to death. So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die. And it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that. Free style English is just. Takes on.
