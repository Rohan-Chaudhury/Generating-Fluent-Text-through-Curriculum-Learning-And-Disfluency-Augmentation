You have any pets? Do I have pets? <SEP> I have a cat. And I have two dogs. Two dogs. What kind? I have a Schnauzer. And I have a Sheltie. Schnauzers. Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer? <SEP> It's a miniature. I'm going into all this because I just got done working at a pet shop. <SEP>. The Schnauzer I'm watching for one of the managers where I work. And he's been transferred to Germany for a while. <SEP> And I'm taking care of his dog. And I had just got the kitten when he asked me that. And he says my dog doesn't like cats. And I said we won't tell her it's a cat because it was a kitten. <SEP> And they just love kittens. They just are fascinated. <SEP> So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet. That's good. They say. <SEP> And they get along real good. I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip. So that was interesting. Didn't expect that would happen. That's cool. That's nice. Let's see. What was the other dog you had? <SEP> It's a sheltie. A sheltie. She's real sweet little dog. She's got a very nice temperament. They're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer. <SEP> The Schnauzers are a little aggressive. They can be nippy. Shelties are nice. Everybody seems to be really happy with them. They're good temperament. <SEP> They're a good temperament. They put up with a lot. And they just. I think they have a good head on their shoulders. I think they have a higher level of intelligence than other dogs that I have encountered. Schnauzers in particular probably. <SEP> But also some poodles. <SEP> They're kind of. There are some smart ones out there. But there's also some not so smart ones. I g-. It seems the smaller the are the worse off they are. Maybe there's some credence in that statement. They're bred down so much. It's. <SEP> They aren't the best pets. I really don't know what the best pet is. <SEP> I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal. Some people seem fairly well suited for miniature poodles and such. And bull dogs. <SEP> But I don't know about these. Pit bulls that are so vicious. Pit bull. <SEP> They might. They're actually very friendly dogs. Are they really? I don't think I've ever seen one. They're really nice. <SEP> I've dealt with quite a few of them. Customers that bring them into the shop and ask me they fit collars and stuff on them. And they are just really nice really friendly kind of medium intelligence. How do they become s-. W-. How did they get their reputation then? Because some people want to train them as. <SEP> They train them to be that way then. You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way. <SEP> It takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond. So the poor animal is doing it in self protection. <SEP>. They aren't by nature really nasty critters. They are very determined critters. <SEP> And so once you get them going it's not good to deal with but I really like them. I was impressed by them. They're real sturdy little critters. And they aren't that big. And just really friendly. <SEP> That's unusual. I was overwhelmed. I. <SEP> I suppose you were surprised. <SEP> After the reputation that. Right now. They have quite an notable reputation as far as. They picked up a lot of bad press lately. <SEP> They're banned in some areas I understand. But any pet can be bad if you train it to be that way. <SEP> That. They must have just targeted that breed and said we're going. It's when. In my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret attacking a child in a house. <SEP>. These people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret. The ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild. <SEP> And they should expect something like that to happen. And so bas-. Now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town. Did it attack the child then? It bit him. <SEP> And that was not a good thing. But I think it was probably an individual ferret thing because it was a fairly wild ferret. The people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that. They hadn't. <SEP> They really should have expected it. And taken the precautions. <SEP> They didn't. It's too bad it happened though. <SEP> Because then the animal's in trouble and not the person.
