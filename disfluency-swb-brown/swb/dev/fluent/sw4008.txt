Do you have a P C? I have a Macintosh S E thirty. A lot of my friends are into Macintoshes. I have a I B M P C myself. <SEP> A two eighty-six. I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six. What do you use yours for mostly? Mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal. <SEP> But I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that. What do you find that you use yours mostly for? I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base. And about the only thing. I'm just starting to get into a little bit more communications now. I've just today ordered a fax modem. So I'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using. <SEP> You don't have to make a hard copy that way. Are you using windows? I think I'm planning on moving up getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although I do like the graphical user environment. <SEP>. It's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh. It's. I just want it more for multi tasking which I suppose is also like a Macintosh. <SEP>. The one thing I used to use a. I've never used an I B M actually. I used to use just an Apple two E which of course looks pretty primitive now. <SEP> That's what I learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school. But I don't have any real programming capabilities on my Mac right now. <SEP> I don't have any compilers. So I'm. Do you use your computer for just things around the house or in the. <SEP> I use it in my business. What do you do? I do consultation and testing of various kinds for English as a second language programs. And do these programs. Are they based on a other language. Or are they based. A lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of parts of the world. And the teacher just tries to teach English through natural understanding. <SEP> That's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly. You seem to be better informed than the average person on that. It was just when I was high school I worked for the community school. And they had a English second language class. And it always seemed strange to me that all these people that spoke English not too well and spoke a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time. <SEP> I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you don't have as many cues. You don't have hand gestures and things like that. We. What I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though. <SEP> Most of the stuff that I do is not interactive. And I use it for data analysis on testing. So. To see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that. <SEP> Actually just item analysis statistical analysis of the tests. When you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is. <SEP> You try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort. So it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use. I would imagine so. So what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E? <SEP> I was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files. I can't believe I've got five megabytes on this one now. It's. <SEP> And on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K. It's amazing how in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much. I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it. And then I started playing with Apples. And those had forty-eight. Or if they were really great they had sixty-four K. <SEP> The original Apple had forty-eight I guess didn't it. I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them is all. <SEP> And. I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K. And there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time. <SEP> And it's just so amazing that generally if you. I'm not sure about Macintoshes. But I know I B M -s you buy a megabyte at a time. That's the low end. <SEP> The S P thirty goes up to eight. But I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet. I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and get possibly another hard disk. I don't know. They say that system seven uses a lot of memory. I imagine.
