What were you saying? I think we're started now. <SEP> Do you want to go ahead and start? I haven't really been up to date on a lot of music. I've been in school. And I haven't really gone out and bought any or listened to much on the radio except for classical. And. <SEP> You like classical music? I like classical music. I like rock and roll. <SEP> I like country and western. I like all kinds. I like different things about each one of them. I like most of them except for country music. <SEP> You don't like country? I think I might like dancing to it. But I don't like listening to it. The kind of country I like is kind of the older country music. Not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that. Whi-. <SEP> That's a little bit to. It's such. They're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing. You know what I mean? What's the old country music like? <SEP> Like Hank Williams. Like the old Hank Williams. Even Hank Williams Junior is real good stuff. The kind that. <SEP> This stuff makes you cry it sounds so sad. You d-. That's the kind you like you mean? <SEP> Sometimes I do. Not all the time. I guess I like the blues a lot. And I guess you could say it's similar as far as the way they do it. <SEP> And I do too. I also like jazz. Me too. I guess I like. Except heavy metal. And most rap I don't like. <SEP> You're about like I am then. I can't watch M T V anymore. I used to love M T V. <SEP> And I can barely watch anymore because they have this heavy metal stuff on there. And I can't like that. And I liked Aerosmith and Led Zepplin and. Van Halen. <SEP>. <SEP> I like groups like that. But when you get. I even like Guns and Roses some of their stuff. But some of these groups now like Slaughter. I really haven't listened to that. <SEP> Some of them are just really rough. You went to school then in. I'm surprised you didn't go to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff. Or. I used to a long time ago. But since I've started back into school now I haven't really done that much. I've been pretty busy. But. So. I haven't. I used to go out and dance a lot. But I don't do that anymore either. <SEP> I see. Are you married at all? I've just been real busy with lots of other things. <SEP> How old are you? Twenty-eight. You went to school for awhile and quit. Then went back. I went to school and got a degree. And then I worked for awhile. And then I started back a year and a half ago. Changed directions. <SEP>. How old are you? I'm twenty-eight. I was born in sixty-three. I guess we're the same age then. <SEP> And I didn't really start getting into music until I went to college because my parents didn't really have music in the house. Put it that way. Were they religious? <SEP> I see. I. I'm always behind. I'm never really up to date on all that stuff. But I know what I like when I like a sound. A certain kind of sound. My parents were very musical. My mother had a piano in the house. <SEP> My father likes country western music. <SEP> He's from West Virginia. So that's what he grew up listening to. And he's always liked it. And he's probably about fifty-three years old now. So he grew up in the late fifties. When they had the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that. And that kind of rock and roll. <SEP> So he likes that. And my mom always liked that kind of stuff. My mom likes Doris Day. <SEP> She always had these old Doris Day records and stuff like that though. I grew up listening to that stuff. <SEP> But I could see why you were kind of sheltered from music. I do play the piano. <SEP> But I like the early seventies late sixties rock. Kind of stuff the old stuff. And. <SEP> So do I. Do you like Van Halen or anything like that? Or how about Brian Adams? Bri-. What songs does he play? <SEP> It. THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. <SEP> I think I've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. He sings that. <SEP> He's from Canada. I'm not very good at remembering the titles. The titles and artists. But I can remember the song. <SEP> Do you watch music television M T V at all? Or V H One? I don't watch T V much at all. <SEP>. Do you get cable? <SEP> That's. You have to get cable to get those stations anyhow. <SEP> But. I like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos. I like watching that kind of thing. It's. Do you like someone recent? Like Enya? Have you ever head of her. She's not rock. But she's from Ireland. <SEP> I haven't heard her. And she's been on the top ten or whatever. <SEP> She did.
