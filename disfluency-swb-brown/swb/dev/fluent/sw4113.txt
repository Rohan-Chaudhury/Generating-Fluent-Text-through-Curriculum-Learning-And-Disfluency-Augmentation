So do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time? Generally I don't think they are. My personal opinion is that the politicians are out for their own good because they're entrenched. <SEP> They don't ever have to go out and get a real job. They just stay in their current job. You know what I mean? I agree with both of those things. But do you see any way of altering it so that they would become more honest? <SEP> I think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems. But it has to be not just at the national level but at the state and the local level too. I know some senators. And I don't know which ones. But they've been in office since the nineteen forties. <SEP> And I. They've never had a job. They've never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes. I know they pay taxes. But they don't. <SEP> They get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year. Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit. And I'm going I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am. <SEP> And they work less than I do. The only problem I see with term limitations is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is with most governments is just so complex that there is a learning curve and that you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect his first day to be an effective Congress person. I think there's a lot they need to learn when you get there. <SEP> I think that's true. However I think that's always been true. That's true of the Presidency too. And we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years. And. But. <SEP> They. There is a lot to learn. But maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up. I think two years is too short. I think it would have to be extended. A term limitation for Congress would be three terms or even four terms. Or you would increase the length of each term of a Congressman. But maybe standardizing on a four year term for Congress Senate and the Presidency and then staggering them so that. <SEP> We aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years. The other thing that bothers me about our system is just that in Congress the amount of power any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there. So it's for. So unless you have actual across the board limitations the idea of. We're. I'm just going to vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work. It's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time. I think that that's true. But then you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin. <SEP> The C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency. The action isn't in West Virginia. I hate to tell the senator from West Virginia this information. But it really doesn't. The world does not revolve around West Virginia as far as this country is concerned. <SEP> The world does revolve around D C as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics. And the C I A is a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia. It might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive. <SEP> And I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that. Or is it the F B I. I don't remember. But I think there's. L-. T-. I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because officially they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative. <SEP> That's officially. We all know that that's not necessarily true. But I think that there are advantages to having seniority or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years. I think there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain. <SEP> But I think that with all the perks that we've given them. I heard on the radio back a few weeks ago during the incidents where they aren't paying their restaurant bills. And they're bouncing checks all over the place. <SEP> One of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks.
