Martin do you do any exercise? I do. I like to play basketball and weight lifting. Those are probably the two main things I like to do. So those are more or less indoor sports. How's the weather out there in Georgia? <SEP> In the winter typically it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis. I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall. <SEP> But in the winter it gets pretty cold. So it's mostly indoor sports in the winter. <SEP> How about yourself? I'm on a exercise program. I'm riding my Aerodyne bike half an hour every morning. And I'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning. And I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time. It's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise. <SEP>. Do you do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise? First of all I'd like to get my weight off. I'm about fifty pounds overweight. And so I'd like to get the weight off. And then I'd really like to get into that. <SEP> And my husband and I have a aerobic video that's called The Firm. I don't know if you've heard of it. But it's an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down. But you're using weights. And that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done. It's really fun. <SEP> It's similar to aerobics with weights. But it's like low impact aerobics just with weights. <SEP> Are you familiar with step or bench aerobics? I am. But I have never done it myself. Have you done that? <SEP> I have. In Atlanta that's. Most of the health clubs are all. That's the in thing. That's the big thing? <SEP> At first it was just regular aerobics. But now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over. So how is that? <SEP> They call it a low impact aerobics. And it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time. And from when I've done it it does give you a real good workout. <SEP> But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees that and movement of going up on the step that could create a problem. <SEP> They seem to think that it won't. But you never know. If playing basketball are you knees. Do you have healthy knees? <SEP> I think my ankles probably are my main weak point. But I've kind of taken care of that. I wear high tops and then also a support ankle brace which is very stiff. <SEP> And wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so. That's good. You sound just like my husband. He injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball. And he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy. <SEP> I. So that's what he does. He wears his brace and his high tops. And. I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy. <SEP> It would only take three or four days. And I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way. <SEP>. <SEP> So how successful is your exercise video? It is amazing how fast you take off the inches. And I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week. And then every other day I'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day. <SEP> But it is really amazing how fast the inches come off. And the muscle builds real fast. You can start. They recommend doing the video without weights for the first month. And then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your twenty-five pound dumbbells. <SEP> And then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video. And it's a hour long video. So. So it's a good workout. It is. I really enjoy that. So I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy. <SEP> So in the winter there's a lot of. It's quite cold and snow. <SEP> This one has been quite mild. We could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground. It was quite chilly. But not.
