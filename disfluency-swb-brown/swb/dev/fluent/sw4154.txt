What do you feel about the present situation in the Mideast? It looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is. <SEP> What do you think Mark? I agree. I think there's definitely been some changes. And I think the end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on the situation. In that. Basically since the end of World War two there was always that little proxy war going on. With the U S funding Israel and the Soviet Union funding the Arab countries. <SEP> And then we'll see what happens when they're not funded quite as much. Or supplied with arms the same way. <SEP> But on the same token Israel has lost a lot of their value to the U S in being the foothold of capitalism. In the Mideast. <SEP> We tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves. We kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them. <SEP> But I think one of the most interesting things to me recently during the war in Kuwait was the fact that they did not retaliate for the scud missiles that were launched there. <SEP> That just seemed to me to be a phenomenal demonstration of restraint. And it must have reflected some awful good diplomacy on the part of the U S. But on the other hand if they would have had a hard time retaliating because they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes. I see. They would have had to fly through two enemies. <SEP> You don't think they got the codes from the U S already? The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them. I see. Of course public statements can be taken for. <SEP> That's true. They can yet they. D-. <SEP> What do y-. What about this situation with the continual harassment by Iraq right now and apparently failing to let the arms inspectors have free access. To begin with. I pretty much question what the U S -s motives were in actually the original involvement. I. The cynical side of me says that it was more for the domestic political situation than for anything else. And for portraying Bush is a strong President. <SEP>. My gut feeling is that he pretty much picked the fight with Hussein. <SEP> I'm not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to enter that fight. But I think that we chose to have our official feelings hurt. <SEP> Where a lot w-. Do you think that we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and move on into Kuwait and see what happens? <SEP> I think that in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen. And I really don't think that. I think there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests. <SEP> May have been. I'm not saying that that's not the case. And along this line since it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait. <SEP> I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and in fighting a second battle. Over what probably won't accomplish much for him politically. <SEP> It doesn't look like we're getting ready to do much more in there. Even at this point. <SEP> What about. Do you have any views on Israel's relation to the U S? Do you think we ought to back off on our support of the country. <SEP> Or what do yo-. I have very fixed feelings about Israel. I think that for a long while we've had almost a ha- t-.
