How do you feel about gun control? I don't think that guns should be outlawed. <SEP> But it's going to. A lot of the stuff that. All you do is to get guns and then with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago But I don't really know unless they do just outlaw them how you can prevent that. <SEP> Don't you think that just having some almost a driver's license be required with stiff penalties if you are found with a gun that is not registered or that you are not licensed to carry. It varies from State to State. That. Do you even know what the procedures are now? <SEP> There is no national. But it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it. In most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. Or on probation or other obvious things like that. <SEP> And I know that in a lot of states you could be just released from a mental hospital the day before. Be obviously insane. But have your legal right to get a gun. I didn't know that. That's pretty scary. So do they want us to say where we feel about it in rating it one to ten. I'd probably say about a five. <SEP> That's where I would probably be. Seems like it's a good safe number to pick. I don't really know how they can really enforce the laws any better. <SEP> Because I do think that some people need them for protection and stuff. And I can understand them wanting to have them. But then again it's just all those nuts out there. No-. If you are looking at country where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that. The amount of violent crime has decreased by so much. <SEP> It has? Because then. The. In comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States. The problem though since the United States had this pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think if you were introduced any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already. <SEP> So it's really kind of a complex problem. Is the crime that bad there in Atlanta? I'm not really sure how bad it is. I've not really had that many problems with it. But apparently we were ranked pretty high up. <SEP> I know Dallas is. I think in the te-. I think we have been ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years. I don't know if Dallas is in the top three. <SEP> But. Do you own a gun? I've thought about getting one. If I get one I think I will probably get something. I probably wouldn't get a hand gun. I would probably get a shotgun. Just for protecting myself. From burglar type thing. I do kind of live in the downtown area. <SEP> And shotguns are really good because they're. Somebody is not going to break in steal it and use it to mug someone. That's true. And you. I just don't understand these people when they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves. They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through. They are probably going to miss the person. And they're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone. <SEP> A shotgun just really struck me as being a real good defensive weapon. You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of whoever. <SEP> When I first moved to Dallas I moved up here by myself. You pretty much stop them. And you don't. Then the actual shot doesn't go that far a wall will stop it pretty much. And my Dad gave me a gun. <SEP> But I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it. So I finally ended up giving it back to him. I said I don't want it. I don't want to be responsible for it because if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to be responsible enough to go out and learn I don't need it. <SEP> <SEP> That really does scare me. People that have guns. Because if you ever get in the situation where you are not prepared to shoot. But you pick up the gun and point it at the person that person rushes you. <SEP> And they get it from you. And you're pretty much dead. Because you've just told the person that you're about to kill them then. <SEP> Set them off. And you basically made it clear to the person that you are a real danger to them. And then if they manage to get the gun from you their first reaction is going to be stop you. That's why I ended up giving it back to him. I thought. I don't want it if I don't really know how to use it. <SEP> And I just didn't want the responsibility. <SEP> So. Did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever? Did it happen at a cafeteria or something? It just makes you wonder how people get guns. <SEP> I would be scared selling guns to people.
