Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore? That's a good question. There was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed. But since I've become a parent and since I've seen things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that. I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people. <SEP> And try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment. Of the statements made by people against the death penalty I like the statement made by Cuomo. Cuomo is. He's governor of New York. But he's against the death penalty. But he said that he would want to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if they did something to his wife. And that's. But even in that situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the things. It's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response. <SEP> And that was the thing that killed Dukakis back four years ago when someone asked him a similar question. And he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for a gut level reaction. And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. Whether it be a biblical force the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life type logic or just some sort of anger at putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill. <SEP> I think people are working at that from more of a gut reaction than a a reason humane one. I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do. Are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or that aren't conforming enough to society so that we work well together. Or are they. Is it a penal institution? Is it designed for punishment? The death penalty surely fits in well in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment. Perhaps not in the manner that we do it. But in theory it fits in. In a reformatory. If you put someone to death you obviously can't reform them. <SEP> That's true. The other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent. And I really don't agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say I was about to kill and dismember this person. But if they catch me they're going to kill me. So I better not do it. I just don't think that it works that way. <SEP> I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. People say that. But if it was really a deterrent I think horse thieves in the old west. They saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. And if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent I would think that it would be public. I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it. If someone ever. If. Say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and see a guy burn or something or shot by a firing squad or something like that. I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than telling them that there's protestors out here at the. <SEP> I don't know if that would really work that way or not. There's a lot of violence.
