Music do you like? Lots of different kinds I guess. I like country music of course. <SEP> Texas. And I listen to Christian music a lot because there's a Christian music station here in our city. So I listen to it quite a bit. I am more into rock and roll myself. <SEP> And I listen cause on Friday nights they have what they call Saturday Night Alive. Or on Friday night and Saturday night and they have Christian rock and roll. So. <SEP> They have that type of music. But they just have different words. So I listen to that too. Do you like any bluegrass? <SEP> Not really. And I like rap music. At least your. <SEP> Do you like rap music? Not really. Not really. <SEP> I can tell we're together here. <SEP> We'll have to. What kind of. I have a lot of friends that like country music. <SEP> What kind of rock music do you listen to? Do you listen to that really heavy metal stuff. Or. I'm more into older rock like the psychedelic era like. Seventies and that stuff. Late sixties seventies <SEP> Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash. I have friends that like that. What? <SEP> You have never heard of the Christian music that I listen to probably. I've heard a little bit of it. I've just. <SEP> Have you heard of Carmen? Have you ever heard of Kim? I've heard of Striper. So the only one I can. Striper. They're the heavy metal stuff I guess. <SEP> The first of Amy Grant before. <SEP> Became more mainstream top forty. Cause she plays both secular and Christian. So. <SEP> I like her too. I have been to a concert a couple of times of hers. I've never actually seen her in concert. I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show. <SEP> She does. She's real good. So I like her. <SEP> I like some country music. It's just that I finding a lot of it's. I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog left me everybody's left me. <SEP> Mama got run over by the train. I don't like that. <SEP> I like Randy Travis. I like more of the real new ones. Like Garth Brooks. <SEP> Garth Brooks he's fine. Reba MacIntyre. I like them. I don't care for the older the dog left me stuff. You don't like Patsy Cline? <SEP> You don't like Patsy Cline. I don't even really know who she is. <SEP> But have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like? That music that you like to. Actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead about a week ago. But aren't they done with? I thought that they. They are still on tour. They have been touring since the late sixties. <SEP> And I just thought that they done broke up and left. <SEP> They're still together. They're still making albums. <SEP> I didn't know that. <SEP> That's interesting. In fact there are people that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that. <SEP> Cause they are on up there in age aren't they? They're late forties early fifties. But whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement. <SEP>. They seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players. They keep on dying. And they keep on replacing them. And the new one's in this thirties. <SEP> But. Cause they look pretty rough. I've seen picture of them. And they just. They don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones. They just. I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured. But it looked like leather day at the geriatric. <SEP> Cause they just. All their faces were just all shriveled. <SEP> Yuck looking. It just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans. <SEP> Are you into that rock music all that druggy stuff and all that? <SEP> You know what I am saying. They come on the stage. And you. They don't even know they are there. They are just so out of it. Actually I prefer my performers to be pretty sober just so if they're jamming that they don't just lose themselves and go into lala land. <SEP>. So I just don't like. <SEP> That. So I don't know. Have you seen any concerts lately?
