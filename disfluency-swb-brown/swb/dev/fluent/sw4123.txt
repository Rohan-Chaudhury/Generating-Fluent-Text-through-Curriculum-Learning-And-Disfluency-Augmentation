Jimmy how do you get most of your news? I watch the national news every day for one. I also read one or two papers a day. And I'm pretty much a news junkie. And I tune in to C N N a lot. When you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when? <SEP> Every evening at six thirty. I watch the national news. I would probably be a junkie or watch C N N a lot. But I don't subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also because. I give to the United Way. And so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that. <SEP> As opposed to paying for cable. I take away a addiction. Something. <SEP> I. Overall I. The quality of the news you get off of most sources is pretty low. It's. Usually you get pretty incomplete coverage. And that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible. Because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on. You would hope. But still hard to say that what you've heard is what really is. <SEP> What newspapers do you read? I read the local newspaper. And I also try and read one of the major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that. For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES actually a couple of newspapers because my fiance. She was unemployed for a while. So she really needed to look at the help wanted ads. <SEP> And so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news. And I don't know. NEW YORK TIMES is okay. And when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so. But they say it's like the sixth grade reading level. <SEP> But I swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes. <SEP> Pretty low. But I don't know. I think if you listen to N P R or something like. <SEP> I really like N P R a lot. That's pretty good. And I like listening to that on. When I get a chance when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it because I. I miss N P R a lot also. I really like them because they give. Instead of being as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which I think is good. <SEP> And they also. Their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than your major network news and that kind of thing. McNeil and Lehrer. I guess he's leaving. One of them is leaving. They're pretty good too. I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot. <SEP> Had that invasion or whatever it is. Sure was. But I don't know. I guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype. Look at the Smith trial. <SEP> That was a joke. That was. But then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good. The N P R doing that. I know. I had some visitor. And he was just fixated on that just listened to it constantly. <SEP> And I guess that's good when it's live if you'll really want that. But that's not really providing you news. It's more like a media event rather than reporting. <SEP> But the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while. That's kind of boring to me I think. <SEP> It is really kind of boring. But that's. If you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report somebody else's view about it. And that's what you're supposed to. If you watch the news your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion which I would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's. I guess that's true. But one of the ways that I get information is every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing. It's free inside the company. It's called INTELLECT. And they basically type out abstracts which are really literally. I've actually read the actual articles. They're pretty g-.
