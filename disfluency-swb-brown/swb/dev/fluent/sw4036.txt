I think that one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't convict someone who really shouldn't be convicted. Definitely. And I think that a unanimous verdict helps to ensure that. I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that you would have a problem that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. <SEP> Have you ever served on a jury before? I have twice. <SEP> It was a pretty wild experience. What sorts of cases were they? They were just small time cases where trailers and banks were involved. So were they criminal or civil? <SEP> They were civil. They weren't any criminal. What was the verdict? Did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? <SEP> The jury I think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people. So it was. They. And the one changed his vote at the end. So did it become? <SEP> So it became unanimous after they turned it in. And then he changed his mind after they turned it in. <SEP> But it then became unanimous. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter? You just needed a majority? What was the other case? That was also civil? <SEP> The other case was just traffic. The. And it was seat belt law. And it didn't even hardly go through. Didn't really even count. <SEP> So. I'm a college student. So I haven't been a jury eligible age for very long. And I did get one summons actually at one point. But I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student because it was a very bad time. <SEP> You learn a lot going to the juries like that though. I would like to do at some point. But I haven't. One thing that I think maybe is a problem is I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now. But I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well. Especially sort of. I wouldn't think that it does from what I experienced in them. Wha-. <SEP> It didn't turn out the way I planned it the way that I would think that it would go. You thought it turned out pretty well? But it was. Jury was unorganized. And it just wasn't organized enough for me. <SEP> I'm not used to it not being organized. And I just assumed that it would have been. So it was just kind of a zoo. And the jurors just sort of. Someone had to figure out what was going on? That's about what it was. That's interesting. Did it work out pretty well in the end? Did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume sort of a moderator role in the trial. Or. <SEP> They picked one person. And then he finally moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. So it did end up working out pretty well? It ended up working all right. The one thing I sometimes wonder about in civil cases is whether especially sort of in maybe product liability or medical malpractice where there's sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes. <SEP> It's not just a matter of did this guy rip off this guy. And it's just a matter of interpreting a contract. It's sort of a matter of sometimes getting into very technical issues. And I wonder if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about whatever issue is under discussion. I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on. In the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. So. <SEP> The bank was suing them because they went to get the trailer which was seemingly their property. <SEP> It was on his property. So the deal was that he had borrowed money from the bank to buy it. And he hadn't made the payments. <SEP> So they came to get it. And then when they came to get it it was on the landlord's property. And he wouldn't let them take it off. So they were suing to get it back. <SEP> And it was a double wide. So they'd already taken it apart. So they left it there. <SEP> And then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it. So they were suing him for the money. And there's no way they could because it was the moving company.
