. I used to work in a day care center. I worked in all the different areas of the day care center. And they can be deceiving to people. I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the treatment that the children got. And this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three centers all over the city. <SEP> And they would be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left. I think if you do day care centers you should make frequent checks to check in on them when they're not expecting it. <SEP> Because they do do things differently when you're not around. So. That. I know wh-. The things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have. And how many kids they have and how they break it up. <SEP> Because we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in. <SEP> It was a really good one. And in fact it worked out for us because we kind of bartered. My wife did artwork for them. So we got our day care free. But they didn't have enough teachers. And. This one was set up good. They had two teachers to every room. Sometimes three. <SEP> And they had a good system so when you walked in everything looks cool. The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough. They did not show them care to these small children who are being left. <SEP> They. One time I picked up this little boy who was crying. And the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. He said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up. <SEP> And I said no. This child was crying and needed some comfort. What is your problem. <SEP> Did did they separate them by age group? Because I think that's one thing that was important. They did they had the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room. <SEP> Then they had the three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives. Just like that. They really did separate them well. <SEP> It sound. It was just the teachers themselves. It sounds like to me your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people. Affectionate people that they're may be parents themselves or something. <SEP> But. That they're not. Their system. <SEP> But their system was great. But the caring just wasn't there. The one woman that did the babies. I worked with her. And she was fabulous. <SEP> She loved them babies. And she loved them and cared for them. But every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and would make me a nervous wreck. I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and know all the technical stuff. But if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good. These kids are just in a day care center all day and with no any type of emotional getting love getting care. <SEP> They're just there. Going through this routine which is lousy. <SEP> An-. The other group that we had was kind of interesting. The other one we went to it was a husband and wife team. <SEP> And we knew them from other associations. But it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one. And I think she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff. But he was actually the more demonstrative type. The more loving. He would laugh with the kids and play with the kids. And it was kind of interesting to see that it was actually the man in the group that did that side of it. <SEP> An-. You don't see that much. So they had a really nice balance. We liked that one. In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something. That's cute. <SEP> But they also did some of the teaching things. And then they had. Obedience was important. That has to be with a day care center. So I think they used the. You probably heard where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself. I've never heard of that. That's a new one on me. <SEP> And it's one. I can't remember what they call it actually. But you just stand them in front of a clock. And it has a second-hand that goes around. <SEP> And they have to stand there.
