So Julie how do you feel about AIDS research? I think we definitely need more of it definitely. I'd agree too. But it seems like it just makes economic sense in that. It would have made even better economic sense to have had a lot more research than a longer ago. <SEP> For certain. Because the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients. <SEP> Do health insurance policies for companies and things do they cover diseases like that? I think they cover AIDS. But what they do is if you apply to get a insurance policy they'll check to see if you're H I V positive. And if you are not only will they not give you a policy. But they have. There's a database of people that have tested positive. So you'll never be able to get insurance ever again. <SEP> But that's why they should have started doing stuff before. Still since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people who are draining a lot of money right now. I think a lot of it was just that because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about. <SEP>. That. <SEP> And all these God-fearing people were God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera. One humorous retort I heard was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people. <SEP>. But. <SEP> That's a good one. <SEP> Do you actually think we're doing enough right now to. I really don't. I did a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff. And really we're not doing much at all. Most of what gets raised it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by conscious communities and things like that. Private organizations. <SEP> San Francisco has a real strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff. And they get donations from the community And from corporations around the city for AIDS research and that kind of thing. <SEP> And I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level rather than just in the places where it's predominated so far because it's bound to spread. <SEP> It seems that it's just going to reach a steady state a lot lot higher point than it will if we'd nip it in the bud to quote Barney Fife. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the likelihood of that is. But people really waking up. <SEP> Especially with the ultra conservatives move our political system sort of seems to be taking. I would probably agree with that. <SEP> So. So do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of people? That's a good question Fish. I don't know. I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or research per se but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society kind of like lepers would. <SEP> And it's really not necessary until the disease reaches its final stage becomes really infectious. <SEP> And I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they don't have to be just completely cut off from the community. <SEP> And I don't know. I guess I think that research is the most important just because it really needs to come to an end. I don't know. I don't know Fish. What do you think about that subject? I think it stands a really interesting question of.
