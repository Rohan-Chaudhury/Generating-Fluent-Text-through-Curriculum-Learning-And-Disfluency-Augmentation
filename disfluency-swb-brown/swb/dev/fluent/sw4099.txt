. I guess we're talking about exercise? <SEP> First of all I have to ask you how old you are? I am twenty-seven. Twenty-seven. I am quite a bit older than you are. <SEP> But. I think exercise is extremely important. And I do exercise on a regular basis. You do? What type of exercise do you do? I do jazzercise which is an aerobic program that. You do. <SEP> Are you familiar with it? It's a national company. And we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes all day long. So you can. Are they different from aerobics. Or is it the same thing? <SEP> It's an aerobic routine. You warm up. And then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting slowly and then working up to a high heart rate. And then you gradually go down again. And you do that every day. Or. I only do it probably two or three times a week. <SEP> The minimum they want you to do is three times a week. And this is a club. Or do you belong to a group? It's really a. It's called a center. And you buy as many classes as you want to at a time. And then you just go in whenever you can. So I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings. Do you go with friends. Or do you go alone? <SEP> I go by myself. And that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me. And most of my friends that are my age don't exercise. Or they might play tennis. <SEP> And since I am not a tennis player I don't get that. But I am in my late forties. So there aren't many people that want to do that. <SEP> Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. With children between the ages. Young mothers or. Young mothers. Young women with small children are the ones that I find. <SEP> What do you do? I really don't have a routine. I like playing basketball. We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop. And that's what I do every day. <SEP>. Do you play every day? Pretty much. When my wife lets me. <SEP> Who do you play with? Do you have friends that play with you. Or just. I just shoot around by myself. And that's about it. I use to play soccer a lot in high school. But when I graduated I haven't done much. I don't have a problem. I know I have to do more aerobics. But I don't have a problem with weight. I could eat all day and not gain an ounce. <SEP> That's really good. And I think that keeps some people from exercising. I don't have a problem with weight either. But I think I don't have a problem because I exercise. You do exercise. <SEP> People are always saying to me how do you stay thin. And it's because I exercise. You do it. But I also watch what I eat. <SEP> But you'll come. Being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet. And I. But as you get older you will. Everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days. But I don't know. <SEP> It might not. Mine. Because everybody's been telling me that too. And so far it hasn't happened. And I just feel like you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get too high. <SEP> I guess I enjoy sports a lot. So that's why I've kept active in that way. But you don't play any other sports but basketball? Basketball. Volleyball. Too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby. I do that. <SEP> But do you ski? Being in Utah I was wondering if you ski. I use to. But it got too expensive. So. Did it really? <SEP> Cause I know that skiing in Utah is suppose to be great. A lot of people do that. But I never find the time. I had rather do other things. <SEP> I have never skied before. But I have friends that go to Utah all the time. And they think it's really. They come up here. And they ski. I guess there's a place where you can ski. Is it Tahoe? Where you ski from. That's Nevada to California I guess. That's in Nevada. <SEP> I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line. But. <SEP> But there is a place in Utah called a funny name. There's Snow Bird or Alta. But it's like Heavenly. Is that it? Heavenly? <SEP> I think it's called Heavenly. I've never heard of that one. You've never heard of that? <SEP> Maybe it isn't in Utah. But they said they've skied Heavenly. And it sounded like that they skied really well when they are actually talking about a place. It's kind of funny. Do they exercise much for skiing? I know when I went you can get sore easily. But. <SEP> You can get really sore. I know you. I've talked to people. But most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore. Is one or two timer a year if I do go on them. And I am really sore after. And then is it your quadriceps that are the worst? <SEP> In your legs and. My legs really really ache. But that's. I am using muscles that I have never used before. <SEP> And it's strange that you can do I did aerobics all the time. And then I went horseback riding. And still I was so sore. And I couldn't get over.
