I get most of my news from newspapers really. I read the daily newspaper the HOUSTON CHRONICLE. And sometimes I'll read the WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES. I don't subscribe to either. But sometimes I get a hold of copies of it. How about you? Do you mostly get things from T V or. <SEP> I actually get most of my news coverage off computer networks. However I do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day. And I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day. That's interesting. You said computer networks. What sort. I am fairly knowledgeable of. <SEP> DOW JONES for example cause the news wire. That's interesting. And it's picked up and actually available at my office. So it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure. And it's sort of by category. For example so I can read a certain business or topics. I-. <SEP> Is it the A P news wire. Or is it something that is a little bit different from that? <SEP> It's similar to that. But it's DOW JONES which is the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire. So that's interesting. I had access in the past to the A P news wire. And I thought that was a pretty good way to get news. I've never used the DOW JONES news wire. But. It. Do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of a broader more long term analytical sort of approach? Actually not. I do follow. I don't know how to describe it. So I'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense. It's a weekly but not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things. <SEP> I'd like to say however that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires. In what way? In sort of quality or sort of an orientation in terms of view point or the way the news is presented or whatever? I think that it has to do with. I personally think. I have a problem with their viewpoint. And I personally think there's a strong bias in the media. You won't offend me. So go ahead and say. <SEP> Like a liberal type of bias. Absolutely. After all who writes. People who are journalist who are trained to write. And that's a liberal field at least from academia. <SEP> And the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong. And it. They generally make mistake on anything technical at least. <SEP> That's right. Even if it's not technical. If it's some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me think I'm not expert in it. They're telling me lies. By mistakes do you mean just honest mistakes. Or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things? I think both. By deliberate I mean mistakes of omission or biased toward a particular liberal view point that they have. <SEP>. <SEP> To give you an example we will go out of the printing media. I know of cases where we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. Which is rather disturbing. That's disturbing. <SEP> He does that. I haven't really noticed them doing that. But whatever. Again I don't watch T V news that much now. If I had access to C N N I would watch T V news more. But I don't usually. I don't have access either. Although I did at one time. And it was. I did during the Gulf War. And it was addictive. Did you think that the Gulf War coverage would be kind of an abnormality? I just wonde- I guess. I would be curious to know what you thought as to how C N N T V news compared to the three networks. Whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever. But I guess you wouldn't. You probably. If you just watched it during the Gulf War that probably wouldn't tell you much. <SEP> During that small sample I would think that everyone was just about the same except the three networks radio television programming. So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on C N N. <SEP> And you.
