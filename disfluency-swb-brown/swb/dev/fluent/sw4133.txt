My feeling is that it's really being used today. It really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal. I think I've seen some statistics that say that it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. Because you've got all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses. <SEP> And it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. For one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible really care. That's. Committing them mostly is either crimes of passion or at the moment. Or they think they're not going to get caught. Or. It's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon. I'm invulnerable. I don't need to care about this. I'm never going to get caught. <SEP> B-. But you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like Jeffrey Dahlmer. Do you want. By putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again. One way or another. <SEP> Whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility. But the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison and somehow redeem himself. <SEP> I don't think he could ever redeem himself. But in some cases. So that. The other problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent? There are cases where twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then. I'm sorry. Guess we killed the wrong guy. <SEP> It's. Once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it. You can apologize nicely. But I think the price. It's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned. Is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works. It's a-. The benefit of the doubt to the last iota is based on the person who is accused. And I think that. And the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush. Where are we going to impose d-. It's like for drug dealers is the new big thing in. Tsongas is also saying make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer. <SEP> And again I don't thing these people care. They risk their lives every day. And they seem that the profit margin's so high that the risk is almost not there. <SEP> And especially now I live in Massachusetts. We're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something. But you look at our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to Texas or someplace that does it's impossible to make a case that it's affecting it in any way. <SEP> I think it's mainly people they get the vengeance of it. It's also. Because. <SEP> I used to live in Georgia. And the big thing down there was we have capital punishment. But if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related. It's lot of blacks. Also a lot of young people. A sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen. <SEP> And I think when you listen to the victims' families and things they're always talking about feeling justified or feeling like they've gotten something out of it. My thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the victim's family. The only thing that should really. Obviously if someone of mine who has close died I'd probably feel differently. But the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society. <SEP> And that. And also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility of making restitution. The. You will work your prison job. And any money you earn will go to the victim's family. And the other thing is that I was reading through a book on human geneo research. <SEP> And there more and more things like schizophrenia. And why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin. So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say the problem is you've got an endorphin imbalance. And if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society. <SEP> You really get back to the question of is someone responsible for their actions. I think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions. I never liked the insanity defense. Society made me do it. <SEP>
