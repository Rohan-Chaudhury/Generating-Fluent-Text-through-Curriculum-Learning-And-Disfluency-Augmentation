Pretty good. Pretty good. We're talking about drug testing in the work place. Drug testing in the work place. I've been tested a few times just before employment. But that's about it. I've never had random drug testing. We have random drug testing in my business. But I've never had to do it. <SEP> They started that about a year ago. And I think it's mostly for the field people that drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff. But they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time. At least that's. <SEP> They do with alcohol. They do it with alcohol? They'll check for alcohol. <SEP> I thought it was just marijuana or cocaine. Once you start doing that stuff you're sort of stuck into checking for the whole thing. That's interesting. It's a. <SEP> What type of field of work are you in? I'm in the oil business. In the oil business. <SEP> And you work in the office around. I work in the office. So it's pretty safe environment. <SEP> I work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars. And we work around a lot of explosives. That sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on. <SEP> So that's. I'm all for it because the type of environment I work in they're working with explosives. And so they could blow up the whole. They have safety features with each of the explosives they use. But still it can be dangerous. I agree. I think that under certain circumstances especially when you're working in high risk industries where you can really hurt other people that you need to have that kind of stuff. If it's. As long as it's not abused random. As long as it's random and the individual's rights are protected I don't have that big a problem with it. <SEP> Do they fire them or do they? This is it. This is where I start having my problems with my company. I work for a private company. And the policy is something like. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling. <SEP> But if they catch you if you test positive for a controlled substance then you get fired. So it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos. <SEP> That's. I think our policy is that. It's probably the same thing. I'm not really sure what the. It's one of those things that you read once. And then if you're not worried about it you just forget about it. That's right. But I know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance. But I'm not sure if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in. <SEP> Our company's a little tougher on the second chance. If they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to go out of the way a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated to get back at your job. But when you're a private company the rules don't always apply. <SEP> Do you think it limits. It's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment. And it's not. I guess I haven't run into anybody that's been a problem. So I guess it works much like any lottery. Everybody's got an equal chance to get picked. <SEP> I'd rather have that than say this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in. And next week C -s and D -s are going to come in. <SEP> You could time it just right. I know one employee. I know when I was working with he had alcohol on his breath. And I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not. That'd be just as dangerous. Especially around equipment machinery and stuff. <SEP> That's true. I've gone out and had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case. Do they give any limits on alcohol. Or is it? I don't remember to tell you the truth. I don't think they do. They must. That just shows you how much I've been paying attention. Because I really don't know. <SEP> I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask. You can take some of that testing a little bit too far. There was a company in Houston. They did an unannounced drug sweep of their company. <SEP> It was an unannounced sweep of. It was not only drugs.
