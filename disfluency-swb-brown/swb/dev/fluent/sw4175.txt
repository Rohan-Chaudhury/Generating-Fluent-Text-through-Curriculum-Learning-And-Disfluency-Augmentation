I don't believe that we're. What do you think about recycling programs in Atlanta Julie? The recycling program here is just terrible. It's hard to find places to go. Kroger does a couple things. Do they do newspapers? <SEP> I don't know. There's big bins out there. I don't know if they ever get. I really don't know what the details are. There should be someplace where you could call and find out. As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest thing to you. But I think there should be some kind of curbside service. That's the only way I could really. The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans like soup comes in and stuff. <SEP> They pick up everything. During the summers around where I live the homeless people see-. They all have shopping carts and stuff. <SEP> And they go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff. And so we used to just save them up. And then they'd come around. And we'd give them to them. <SEP> But when. During the winter time they move south or something. So I don't do that anymore. And the recycling at Georgia Tech like that outside the student center they never empty those things. <SEP> I know it. I know it. They just overflow. It piles up. <SEP> What's a guy to do. I asked myself. <SEP> I just don't know. I just don't know. And now they have bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center. You can't really unload all your stuff. <SEP> That's true. Hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient. Inconvenient even. I know it. I know it. <SEP> But. You do recycle don't you? I'm kind of bad about it. The. <SEP> If I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there. But I don't ever take anything. It's real. You ought to because the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything. <SEP> And since we go there all the time. But wait. Probably at all. <SEP> I've never seen you before. Who are you? By the way may name's Julie. <SEP> My name's Bill. I'm from Atlanta. <SEP> Me too. <SEP> Is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie? I just think that everybody ought to do it. Do they do. What about. What kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know? The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs. <SEP>. What about those grocery bags? They have. What I used to. Now that I don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot. But I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over. <SEP>. But also most places Big Star does. And I'm not sure if Kroger does or not. But. <SEP> They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic. And they have little boxes that you can put your old bags in. Can bring them in. <SEP> Those petroleum products are going to kill us. I know it. I know it. The hostile planet Julie. <SEP> It really is a small hostile planet. <SEP> Those petroleum products are the great Satan of the recycling. Did you know that. Really not. Did you know that something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is. Filled with paper. <SEP> Paper just seems so innocuous. <SEP> Paper doesn't seem threatening at all. It is though. It comes from trees. How can it be bad? It is because they. <SEP> They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it. They do treat paper with chemicals. Yellow paper takes something like twenty times as long to decompose. <SEP> You can bury a piece of yellow paper. It will still be there in a couple of weeks. <SEP> It will be whole. You'll be able to read off of it. I'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads then. <SEP> I'm glad you told me that because I use those at work where I work. But I can just forget that from now on. <SEP> W-. I'm going to switch to the white ones. White paper's bad too. They treat it too. <SEP> What about papyrus made out of bamboo stuff from the banks of the Nile. I'm sure that's fine. I'm sure. <SEP> Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again. You think so? Maybe. <SEP> Tablets? I think we should just abandon the written word altogether. You think? <SEP> I don't know. I think we've kind of. What do you think? Everybody has a computer. <SEP> Kind of radical I know. But. We would no longer need paper at all. <SEP> That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist like Dick Tracy. <SEP> I would love that.
