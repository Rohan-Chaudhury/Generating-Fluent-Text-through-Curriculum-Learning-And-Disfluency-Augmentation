Do you happen to be working for a large firm? It's about three hundred and fifty people. I guess that's not large compared to some. But it's big enough. <SEP> And they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything. And I wish they did. They have a four O one K. But I put all the money into it. <SEP> They don't add anything. What about you? I work for a fairly large company. It's got eight thousand people. And we do have health insurance. We don't have four O one K plan stuff like that. But we do have retirement. They kind of match up to you. If you put six percent they match up to six percent. And then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that. <SEP> That's a pretty good deal. It's not bad. Now how long does it take for your contribution to vest? I don't know. It's probably a long time. I'm sure it's not till twenty-five years thirty years. <SEP> The place I work at's health insurance is kind of expensive. It's hundred bucks a month or something for a family. I guess what we have is what they call a flex benefits plan where you get a certain amount of dollars. And then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need. Otherwise guess you can hold money back and then either use or lose it or can just have that money put in your paycheck. <SEP> We have one of those use it or lose it plans too where they'll basically pay for child care type expenses. I can send in a request for payment. And they'll send me a check for the amount they withheld. That's pretty good. It saves a third off on taxes or something. It depends on which company you work for. I know that the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is plan D. Deductibles are really high. It's fifteen hundred dollars. But if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because if you're relatively healthy then it's really unlikely that you'd use that amount of money. So someone did start a cost benefit analysis. And ends up the best is to take a high deductible and take a loss whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual. I guess. On the other hand I had a similar health plan. And one of my kids was in a car accident. And I wound up having to pay for a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because no insurance policy happened to cover it which is. <SEP> You mean not even your car insurance? It got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here. And I had a high deductible on the car insurance. And then we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it. That's too bad. <SEP> I don't know. I think other than health insurance an extra week of time off would be nice. I only get two weeks. My place you get two weeks when you start. And then every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks. That's nice. We don't get them till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week. <SEP> That's a long time. It's. <SEP> Especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in companies don't stay afloat that long. And they. With the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used to be much more stable. It's a lot less stable than it used to be. They used to have job security crap. But now they don't. You work for Bell or something like that? It's the Bell Corps which is. <SEP>. I don't know. It's no longer. That's what. I think it's still based on the old model of. And now they don't. <SEP> A lifelong job security. Telephone pioneers of America. All that stuff. But they no longer. <SEP> I don't think so. Hearing a lo-. They're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security. <SEP> Does it. They must have pretty good severance though? I don't know. We haven't been doing layoffs. We've been doing down sizing with getting rid of extra layers of management. And I don't know what they do for those people. Mean the management they get rid of? Some of it. <SEP> There's too many chiefs and not enough Indians. But. They put.
