Let's see. Mine's pretty easy actually. I just got done reading a couple magazine articles about the new Saturns. And although I can't afford it right now I would just love to have one. <SEP> You like. So you're an American. You want to buy American. Regardless of that fact. It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. I'm interested in having it for doing a little autocross racing closed circuit racing. <SEP> And it seems to just blow the competition away. It terms of handling acceleration. Handling power everything. It just got the top rating. It was compared up against. Let's see. There was the Mazda M X three Nissan's whatever their N X two thousand the Civic S I. And it dominated over all of them. Everybody all the raters loved it. I like the styling. And I seen a few of them actually race. And they seem to be really good cars for it. <SEP> What about Mustang G T -s? Mustang G T -s? Can't afford it. Those. So you're talking about ones in a lower end price range. I'm a graduate student. And let's face it. I don't make any money. So. <SEP> You can wait till you graduate. And you'll have plenty of money. You can buy whatever you want. <SEP> We'll see then. Right now I'm stuck. I've got a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that. It's fast but unreliable. And trying to get it prepared for racing. But it would be nice just scrap it and go for the Saturn. Would you use that for city driving and racing? I'd use it for both. The nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both. <SEP> Autocrossing is. What kind of track is that? Just a set up a lot of times. And it's really large parking lots. And pylons and things. And you set up the track pylons. <SEP> Tight turns hard acceleration. I've seen a lot of Mustangs compete. And it's interesting. They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class. <SEP>. I would guess so. What are you thinking about buying? <SEP> I think I'd like to get B M W or maybe a Acura Legend. The Legend. <SEP> A Lexus S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order. I haven't really determined if I like the Japanese or if I like them enough to purchase one. Because your B M W -s your German cars have good reputations I think. <SEP> I was actually in. A lot of the B M W -s are produced in Stutgardt and Munich. <SEP> And I was there this summer. And I was really impressed by the factory tours and such for B M W. The. <SEP> They have the whole philosophy. They kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better which is kind of hard to take. <SEP> As you're walking through that little tour in Munich it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you too. Of course. Of course they are. They want you to buy their car. There. It was interesting. I also went to the Porsche. And it was amazing how they were completely opposed. <SEP> The B M W is really we have all these high tech things. And everything is put together with exacting tolerances. And then you go to Porsche. And it's these cars are completely handmade. And no two of them are alike. <SEP> And. That's. So it's completely opposed. I don't know. Which do I like better. I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical. <SEP> It's not realistic. Unless it's a toy. If you can afford that kind of a toy then I guess. Let's face it. <SEP> But B M W -s good for that. What kind of driving you'd want to use it for? Just work. Short trips. No heavy mileage. I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year. <SEP> So it's pretty minimal. That's cool. Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for. That's good. I was impressed by the Mercedes too. <SEP> I really like the Mercedes. But if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things. The factory was nice. And. <SEP> And is it different for the B M W? I think something on the order of a three series it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly. Probably. <SEP> I can imagine that. So I'm kind. <SEP> I'm not sure if I really want.
