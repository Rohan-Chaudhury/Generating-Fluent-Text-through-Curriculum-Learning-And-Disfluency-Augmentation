How do you feel about the Viet Nam war? I guess it's pretty deep feelings. I just went back and rented the movie VIET NAM. <SEP> And. I saw that as well. Got some insight there to kind of help me put together the feelings. I really appreciated the whole English class where the fellow just wouldn't do it. The guy's gouging your eyes out. What are you going to do? <SEP> What for him to finish me off. And it was good to remember that kind of Asian philosophy that. Were you ever in Viet Nam. <SEP> Or. I was kind of an in-between finally drew a high draft number. And you? I was much too young. I was born in sixty-seven. So. <SEP> Both my brothers were draft age. But neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for. Personally I just went in limbo. I had a passport and was ready to go out of the country or join special forces either one. <SEP>. <SEP> I just didn't know. So. So do you feel that it was worth what we did over there? Just a second. <SEP>. Mark what was that again? Do you think the investment in lives and money was worth it? I totally agree with that. <SEP> What effects do you think it's had on our country? Downside. The says we should go into the grief that's there. And presidents have always avoided that as a country. <SEP> So it's pretty serious really. Lot of things that aren't being addressed. I think that's pretty typical of the entire involvement over that nothing was really addressed. It was never. We announced that we were going to war. It was such a gradual and subtle increasement of force that. <SEP> Gulf of Tonkin resolution. And was it a dolphin or a torpedo. You remember that? I vaguely remember we had a spy ship torpedoed or something. Only it was foggy. And finally President Johnson said they weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo. <SEP> Isn't that something? So do you think for example in the Persian Gulf war that it seemed to me that Bush was going to extraordinary lengths to prepare the country for war. <SEP> Mark I've got to go. <SEP> We'll see you. I guess our five minutes are up according to me. Are they to you? I wasn't really keeping count. But I guess.
