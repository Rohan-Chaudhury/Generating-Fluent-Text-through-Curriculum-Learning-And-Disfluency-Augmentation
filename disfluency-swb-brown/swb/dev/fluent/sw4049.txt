I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in very specific examples such as transportation workers as in air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing. I don't really think that it's too many. I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're worthy of working for us. I really don't see that that's a very valid thing for a company to say. And personally I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body. <SEP> I guess I basically agree that. Do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs? Suppose they found out some other way? I think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs. There's too many cases where it can. There can be false positive results and that sort of thing. I don't think there's any definitive. This person is taking drugs. So we don't want him here. <SEP> Like I said some industries though I think it'd be very necessary. I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane. But I find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal. If your employer's not going to trust you. Or it. I think it's a whole trust issue. I just can't see it. <SEP> But have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested. Or. I have been. I was very offended by the whole process. <SEP> I once too. It's very humiliating. And I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs. But I am totally against that sort of a. It's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you. <SEP> I had it during a job interview. And I just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them to do this. And I'm just I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me. <SEP>. That's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just. I was in the same sort of situation as. It was a job interview. And then you had a physical where you were drug tested. And it's. I just. And I know people who have been drug tested and who have not been hired by a corporation which. I really. The other side of it is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy it's my bodily fluid. And I don't really want you to look at it or something pretty basic like that. <SEP> Just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work. During the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there I think they have every right to say these behaviors are acceptable and these are not. But when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work I find that to be fairly offensive also. Like you say if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors. <SEP> And if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons. That's exactly right. <SEP> And also I just think it gets a lot. I'm a big supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies. And I think that it just moves down along a line that I really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work. There's already talk of people. We're not going to hire you if you smoke. I can see how they can say in the work place you don't want them to smoke. But when somebody leaves work I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all. <SEP> Do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this. Or. I really think it should be except in the specified industries or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times. And other than that I do not think it should be allowable. I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that. It's kind of the big brother syndrome. I just. Anything like that just kind of scares me. <SEP> I tend to view it. Even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that I sort of want to defend an employer's rights in addition to an individual's rights. But an employer really has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to. And if they say they don't want smokers I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that. <SEP> And I don't really.
