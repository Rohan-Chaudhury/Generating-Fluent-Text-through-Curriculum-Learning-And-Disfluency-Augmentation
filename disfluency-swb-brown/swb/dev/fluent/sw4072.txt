. How do you keep up with current events? Actually usually in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work. Usually catch the news in the morning. What channel do you watch or what station? <SEP> N B C. That's the one I watch. I usually keep up with T V. I don't. I am a student. So I really don't have much time to read the newspapers and stuff. So I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really isn't too great sometimes. <SEP> I usually tend to just rely on T V again just through the grapevine just to know what today's stories are. And I usually go out an buy a newspaper if I'm interested in any particular one. The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes. The stations I listen to are just mainly music. <SEP> I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all. Do you think that T V is pretty accurate. Sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized. Or. What I really don't like about T V especially local news as compared to national news is just it seems like everything is very spoon feed. And it's more like the news shows is now an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have the wonderful investigative reports is your kid's bus driver smoking crack on the way to school? <SEP> It's. They mainly go with popular topics just not basic news. <SEP>. Also I have the observation with the press that any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press which only happened ten times in my life first thing or anything that actually had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story. <SEP> It's something wrong. Going. Looks like they're going more for ratings than for actual news. <SEP> I think probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers. They typically have a better. I am from a small town too here in Texas and so local news is really who grew the biggest tomato. <SEP> And. The farm report. Farm report and oil reports. <SEP> That's pretty sad. Or who killed who. Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television. Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down. And. In Dallas I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's. And the story was. <SEP> Was that like he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something? And the news covered it hours after it happened. And they were taping people who were crying who had everything. <SEP> And then three days later this local news station was using as their promo to promote themselves. I just thought that's kind of cold. <SEP> I have seen that happen lots of times. Channel X gives you the best coverage. We were on the scene with our team players. And. And it was just. They were showing these dead people. And they were showing people crying. <SEP> Just taking advantage of. <SEP> They are trying to get the most emotional response for. It didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story. But just the play on people's emotions. It's just gotten so. Somewhere it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if. And everything. <SEP> I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally. Even the national news I just find it to be very watered down. <SEP> Very. What did you think of the coverage of the war? I found it very one sided. Did you? <SEP> It just seemed to lack any sort of debate. Not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there. But it just seemed like. They kept just showing how great we were doing. And it never really showed the damage that really happened that's. <SEP>. A lot of times the news coverage showed all the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties. <SEP> And they kind of. If they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who got really hurt and everything. <SEP> And I really think that in the involvement that the press states that the military basically sets the press.
