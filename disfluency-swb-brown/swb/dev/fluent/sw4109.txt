Guy. Some of my things. I'd like to have a short work week. And we need better health insurance and cau-. <SEP> We can start off there. Let's just get started. If you don't want to talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it. <SEP> I just press one then? <SEP>. I think that a short work week is real nice. I have a thirty-seven hour work week. How about you? Right now I'm just a student. I only work part time. But I've work in the job force before. <SEP> And forty hours is just too long. You just don't have any time to do anything. It seems like Saturday you get off. But Sunday you're getting ready for Monday. And if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job. <SEP> And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday. And that would make a bigger market. We'd have more recreation. People would have time to do it. There would be less of a stress level. We'd have less crime. We'd have to build less prisons less police force. It all makes sense to me. Although there may be more crime. If people have more leisure time. It's not clear. And that. That's a possibility. <SEP> One of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the small business can't offer health insurance. And it's too costly. And what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it. So they get a specific rate. What happens is that if people start having chronic illness and things like that. What happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular. <SEP> It's called a group. What happens then is that they cancel because they just can't cancel an individual. So they have to cancel just life insurance. They have to cancel everything. What they do is that they cancel the insurance. And then all the people don't have any insurance coverage. <SEP> But I'm satisfied with my job. I'm an engineering student. And I work for my instructor. And I'm not a typical student. I'm older. I'm in my thirties. <SEP> And so I have a lot of job experience. And my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants. And he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose. But in the same token it's really enjoyable for me because I don't have to have nobody breathing down my back. And one of the things that I really hate about jobs. I don't like bosses that want to yell at you and are down on your back and all this and that. <SEP> I just really can't deal with that. What kind of jobs have you done? <SEP> I do research in computer science. And I've just been doing that for a few years now. My job has most of the benefits I want. What I really like is I like being. They send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as I'd like. But that's just nice a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of. They also. A really important thing to me is when they pay for continuing education. I get night courses that they'll cover right now. And that's really good. That's just great. You have what you might call knowledge power. <SEP> When you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized. Some people can be let go and replaced like a typist somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist. But if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the knowledge you've revised and revamped the system then you're vital to the company. And you get more benefits. That's where I'm. I'm into computers too. And that's one of the things that I've found in any one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge. When you have the knowledge you're not going to be let go. Be one of the last ones to let go anyway. <SEP> What I.
