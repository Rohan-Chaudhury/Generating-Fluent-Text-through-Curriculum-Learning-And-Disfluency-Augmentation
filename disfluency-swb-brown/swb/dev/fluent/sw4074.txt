. What kind of pets do you have? We have one rotten cat. One rotten cat. <SEP> It's my son's cat. I heard a laugh in the background. That's the boys. They know I don't like it. Don't you like cats? <SEP> I like cats. This cat is more like a dog. He's a one owner. He likes one boy in the family and that's about it. That's odd. How does he treat the other people? <SEP> Just stays away or runs usually. But he'll follow my oldest son around. When he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap. But if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing. Did he raise him or something? <SEP> We bought the cat for him. And so he's been the one that spent the most time with him. But I've never owned a cat like that. I've had cats growing up all the time. And they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody. <SEP> That's interesting. So it's a weird cat. We have a mutt. <SEP> A mutt. We named it Hooper because that's where we got it from. Some lady she. A lot of people drop off abandoned pets at her house. <SEP> And she use to work for a veterinarian. So she would neuter them give them all their shots. And we saw an ad saying it was free. So we went down there and picked it up. And it's been an excellent dog. But it's my first dog I've had. And we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work. <SEP> So that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work. Is that kind of your child right now? Right now it is. <SEP> You feel like. It's kind of good training. We have been trying for kids. But right now we haven't had any. But it's pretty good training really keeps her on her toes. <SEP> Have you had dogs before? My brother has. We didn't do a lot with them. I never felt like it was mine or anything. You couldn't do anything. But that did more responsibility. When it's yours and not your brother's. <SEP> But. We've. When I was growing up we always had a dog. And we had mostly mutts. Not mutts but mixes like one or two mix. <SEP> And those dogs always seem to be the best dogs. That's what we found. Ours is like a cockapoo. I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle. <SEP> But it's a really good dog. I don't know. They seem to listen better or something. <SEP> Is your cat a purebred? It's just an accident. <SEP> From my son's friend down the street. Their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens. So. Would you ever want a dog in the family? <SEP> I would. We had a dog that was a mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador. And I should say a pup. And he was just too big for our kids when we got him. <SEP> And when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was a pet. And it was a dog that we gotten. And he was just too big. The kids couldn't handle him. And I was still going to school. And my wife was working. And I was working. And so we just didn't have time to really train him. So he was too big for the kids to handle. So he was just tied up to a post. <SEP> So we gave him to. I don't know if you've. There is a place out here called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville. And they have. I guess it's kind of an animal shelter. But he just takes a few the animals in. And some he destroys. And some he keeps. <SEP> So we took him up there. And he ended up keeping him. Cause he has had him for six or seven years. We saw him just about a year ago. And I thought that sure looks like that pup we gave away. And so we asked him about it one day. And he said yeah. He's been the best dog I've ever had in my life. <SEP> Just goes everywhere with him. He would have been a great great dog. He just needed a lot of time.
