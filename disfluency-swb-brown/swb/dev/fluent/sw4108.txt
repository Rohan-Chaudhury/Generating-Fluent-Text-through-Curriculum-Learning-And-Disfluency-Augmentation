. What do you think about putting the elderly in a nursing home? I think that it varies on the individual basis. <SEP> Sometimes there is no alternative. You do not have family available or family that's. You may not even have family who are around. <SEP> That's true. So sometimes it's not an alternative. But I think also sometimes it can be a benefit if it's for a short time. Sometimes in a nursing home. <SEP> Especially if it's after an acute illness. To get over a. Or to rehab after an illness. That's true. I never thought of that. Sometimes the nursing homes are good for just short periods of time. <SEP> That's true. Until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with. Because too often the acute hospitals are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to. <SEP> They really are. They don't like to keep them longer than a week. So there is some good to it. <SEP> Sometimes too it's used as a dumb job. The families do not necessarily know what to do with them. <SEP> What do you mean? And they don't want to take the responsibility. So they will put them in a nursing home. That's true. So. There's both sides to it too. What do you think? <SEP> And it depends on how sick the person is too. What you're capable of if you have a family to take care of of your own. I would personally like it. If my parents were to get ill I would like to take care of them at home and with some help. That's not always possible. That's true. <SEP> But to the best of my ability I'd like to do it until it gets impossible. I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to. There's not a choice because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home. <SEP>. So that option sometimes is not available if they do not have either Medicare or insurance to cover it. <SEP> That's true. But I think nursing homes can be good. It just depends on what kind they are. You need to check them out ahead of time. And then there's also some that are set up for specialties. <SEP> I know some. Unfortunately some elderly have Alzheimer's or where they wonder or confused or have some mental problem. <SEP> That they're. And you need a special nursing home for that. You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around. And you need people who are trained for that type of problem. <SEP> Who know what they're doing with that. So there's different types of nursing homes I think. <SEP> My grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it. And she really liked the idea of moving there. She's not ill yet. But she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years. And then she decided that eventually she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden. She's very independent. So she's in this nursing home. It's out in the country. And she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook. Gives her a little bit of her own independence. <SEP> But she still has a security there. Some support. And then there's also sort of a wing for those people that do get sick. And what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now. So if she ever does become ill it will be like family around her. That's right. And I've seen some of them like that too. <SEP> And also they have a lot of activities going on for the ones who are more active. <SEP> Sh-. So it's not sort of like a sick place. <SEP> She loves it. She has a great social life. And she travels. And it's in the mountains. And it's beautiful. And I hope that I have something like that when I get older. I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the elderly person who's going in and the family that's going to be effected by it. <SEP> Definitely it's. And sometimes those choices can be made in advance. And sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're. <SEP>
