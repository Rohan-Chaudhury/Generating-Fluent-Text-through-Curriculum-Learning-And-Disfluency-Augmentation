Jackie on taxes I guess I would have to say that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes. What's your feeling about that? I agree. I think taxes are high. Where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both? <SEP>. In New Hampshire we have no what we call broad base taxes. No income tax and no sales tax. We tax business eight percent. Businesses are taxed eight percent. And we have what we call the five B s. For our taxes. Booze butts cigarettes beds hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling. <SEP>. So we do have a very low tax rate. But combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes. And. <SEP> I agree. And I think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting. If you do get money back from jobs. I'm still a student so I only work part time. So I get a check back. So. That's nice. <SEP> From taxes. But. Nice to get a refund. It is. But it's not much. So. Do you think that for whatever taxes we do pay that we are getting value for it? <SEP>. My opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state. And they say they are going to send some back. It's like one arm giving the other a transfusion. You know what I mean? <SEP> It really. I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect. There you go. And that is that money tends to stick where it lands first. And when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you. <SEP> I don't know. I. Don't seem like they are doing much with it. There's plans there. And now that they are voting and people getting into drug and that stuff. <SEP> They have nice plans. But they don't always work. And then they try to raise taxes more. And I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work. But taxes get raise. So. I don't know. I'm not really into politics. That it. I don't really understand it. <SEP> But it's just. It does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend. It's almost like they will spend as much as they're allowed to collect. There is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Ten percent or thirteen percent. There would be no figuring. You would take your income tax. You would have a certain amount. You would take you total salary. <SEP> Those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes. And then there would be a set amount for however many dependent you have. And you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions no deductions or anything else after you figure up who's in your family. And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S. And it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with. <SEP> The could be nice. I'd like to see something like that. I think it would be fairer. And it would put a lot of the tax attorneys our of business. And I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail. But I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans. <SEP> It doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes. It doesn't seem fair to me. <SEP> It isn't. There is not much out there that is fair. That's for sure. I will agree to that. I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. If I am not mistaken aren't they? I mean for your state. <SEP> Do you know what your state income tax rate is? Twenty percent? <SEP> I have no idea. I just. My dad does it all for me. You just pay it. I use. You're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts. And she works as a waitress. And she is attending college full time also. <SEP> And she sends her taxes to me. And I figure them up. She really has no idea. She gets a refund check. And.
