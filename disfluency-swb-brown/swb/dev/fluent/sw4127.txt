. I thought it was supposed to give a recording. But I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for my wife and for me. And I embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial. <SEP> All I do is keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month. But I doubt I do it more than three times a year. Do you use a computer? And. <SEP> I work with them all day. I'm in computer science. Yet I do everything on paper. <SEP> I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers. Mine is really simple because I got all our bills paid off when he was a Marine. He went to Saudi Arabia. And while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off. So really the only bills I have is rent utilities insurance. <SEP> So they come in. I pay them. And that's it. That's about the extent of it. That. I don't really have this major budget or anything. I'm real thrifty. I take care of two children and me and just real careful with the money. What little we have. <SEP> That's what I do. It's pretty straightforward. It's almo-. I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making fancy budgets. It seems like if you're getting to that level you're not in real good control. <SEP> I've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt. You buy something on credit. <SEP> And you pay twice as much for it when you get done. Actually I like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything. <SEP> And I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month. I don't have too many weaknesses. <SEP> But I found out a credit card was one of them. <SEP> It's so much easier if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person. It's it's on sale. Let's go grab it. And if you don't have the money then use a credit card. So I got rid of them credit cards. I guess if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do. <SEP> That was my weakness. It wasn't bad. I didn't have thousands of dollars and like that. I just learned that that wasn't for me. <SEP> But I self-employed. I have my own little cleaning business type thing. So I keep. Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that. Or. <SEP> It's not hard. I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and what it's going to have to go for that month. And it's not that hard. Not at all. That's good to know. <SEP> I always do my own income tax. Do you? I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to do it. <SEP> It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it. R-. All you got to do is read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go. I. <SEP> Just the form. <SEP> It seems absurd that people will pay some bucks just to get someone to. And a lot of them. It's dumb. I guess if you had some really complicated stuff. But I don't. So I don't mess with it. <SEP> But I don't use a calculator either. I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on. I don't have that many things to add up. So. I know too many people who use a calculator. If they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention. <SEP> And it seem. And we have a. <SEP> I bank at N C N B here. And they have a number that you can call in. And I always call in once every other week or so. And I will check off what checks have cleared. And. Do you do that? We have the same thing. <SEP> You do too? And I always check them off and check my balance and my book because I always want to know exactly what I have. <SEP> I do that real often. I do that.
