You want to start? I might as well. One of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution is the ozone layer issue. I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons. And that rather bothers me that I was in effect contributing to the delinquency of the environment so to speak. That's stuff we never even thought about three years ago. <SEP> And one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen was because they were inexpensive. They could be made inexpensive and lots of it. And in that and its properties were great with the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to get your heating and cooling cycles to work. So. Have they stopped that practice now? <SEP> Course there's a tremendous number of refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential utilizing freon twelve. And of course the new cars starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems. But there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera. And that's got me very highly concerned that that's going to be quite a while before we can undo this. <SEP> That could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession. But you got to have people that can earn a salary to pay for this conversion. So I see us in somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless the banks or industry or the government go together and come up with a way to have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting compound. <SEP> Because as I say there's a tremen-. How many families own a refrigerator. And then do that number and then how many a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning. <SEP> There are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks. And the only reason I didn't get into that more when I had my little business was because most of your air conditioning on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree. And. <SEP> So that's why I stayed more towards. And that's a polluting type deal too is the excessive petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with water really make a mess. I hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that's putting out a lot of dark smoke. And I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars. <SEP> But that particular bothers me. Most of the time when you see the busses with the diesel those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor. <SEP> Because when diesel is burned it's it. Diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine. It's burned so completely that you don't have any nitrous oxides or oxides of nitrogen to form by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is not very volatile. Where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone. <SEP> Diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily. And it's got. Its latent heat is high. But it's slow burning at normal pressures. That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the air is heated by virtue of the compression process to one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio. I see. <SEP>. <SEP> And so if the car sucks in fifty degrees.
