What's our topic? Taxes. Taxes. <SEP> Do we pay too much? Do we? What do you do? <SEP> I guess that. It all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in. My tax bracket is pretty high up there. I generally pay the maximum tax bracket. <SEP> And I think that we're paying too much. Because I don't have any children. And I pay a lot of property taxes. <SEP> I don't use an awful lot of city services. It's like I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes. <SEP> And there's so many people who want a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is. <SEP> And I just. Many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes. How about you? Do you pay too much? I can't really complain. I'm a student. And I work as a co-op at Georgia Tech Research Institute. And I'm going to get back most of what I pay in taxes. And one of my parents is still claiming me. <SEP> When you go out into the working world it changes quickly. <SEP> I'm sure. You look at your paycheck. And you go where did it all go. <SEP> What kind of. Have you pay a lot of in ta-. Have you been out working and then gone back to school. Or did you go directly from high school into college? I went. I did work for some time. But I didn't make enough money to really make too much of a difference. To worry about it. <SEP> Have you been active in politics concerning this? Have you worked on political action committees or something like that? I haven't. I haven't done any of that type of work myself. <SEP> But every once in a while when I hear up here in D C area one of the radio stations has been talking about the Congress. Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there. There's a bank that they all bank with. And I guess it went defunct recently. And one of the Congressmen has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks. <SEP> And we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule. <SEP> And it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to D C anyway. <SEP> It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur. I think we pay too much. And I look at my paycheck. And I make. Let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes. <SEP> I think I pay forty-two percent. Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government. <SEP> And then they charge me sales tax. And they charge me gasoline taxes. Taxes. And they charge me all these others. And it's just too expensive. <SEP> I can't believe that. I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for. You know what I mean? <SEP> Have you used student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government? I haven't. My father pays for my tuition. So I haven't made use of that. What are you studying down there? Physics. <SEP> Physics. That sounds like a fun field. Everybody says that. <SEP> Scientific. Heavy science. <SEP> Are you in the particle research or anything like that. Or is it more applied physics? I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet. Actually the degree I'm getting is physics. There's a different one for applied physics. So I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied. <SEP> Maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's come rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward. I doubt about that. Are we pretty steep compared to most countries? <SEP> Actually I don't think we are. I don't think so either. Europe England. I know the taxes are a lot higher. <SEP>. <SEP> But they do have socialized medicine and things like that. And I know I was reading in the paper that they're talking. Or maybe it was on the radi-.
