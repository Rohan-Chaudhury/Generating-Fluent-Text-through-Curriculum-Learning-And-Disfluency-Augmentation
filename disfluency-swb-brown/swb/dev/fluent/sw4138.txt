Think about taxes. I think they're a necessary evil. I wish the government would operate on the same premise that businesses operate on. And that is you don't spend more than you bring in. You spend what you have. And. <SEP> I think that the general idea is to spend during a time of recession for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy. But they're running under the assump-. The way they're running it now they're running it under a deficit spending while we're not under a recession. So there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running. So that's kind of a basic thing of economics keep spending keep going into debt. You're not going to payoff what you owe. So I guess the question was more like do you get what you pay for. I. It just depends. Roads are very expensive commodity and so is utilities they supply and police and fire department. They need to make a living. There's. <SEP> So I think for many years we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are to a great extent public servants we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society. I agree with that. <SEP> But then again it's hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments. I guess. I'm a student right now. And I don't make a whole lot of money. And so I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes compared to what I get because all my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school. And my education all up through high school and stuff. So I guess I'm kind of in debt because I don't been paying taxes all that long. My parents however have contributed to that for the education side of it and everything. But I usually end up getting money back. I will this year anyway from a. You're very fortunate. I am. <SEP> I need it too. Otherwise. We just try not to pay any more in than we have to. We pay in a substantial amount. <SEP> We don't regret paying taxes. We do think that sometimes we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax. And progressive tax does not give people incentive to make more money. And what I mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay. More taxes you pay. <SEP> It should be a flat percentage. And that percentage ought to be an equitable amount. Isn't. Last year when they passed the tax laws for the nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else. <SEP> And I totaled them all up. And basically we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax. <SEP> That was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there even though there's taxes on different things. Isn't. <SEP> But there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying. Like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax. There's a lot of hidden taxes. You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your tank. <SEP> The taxes that people don't think about that. The income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay I guess. But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes. There was that. <SEP> Which can-. Was it Jerry Brown. One of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the tax codes they have now and implementing a flat percentage something like that. If you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people to make more money. And what people need to understand in my opinion is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes. <SEP> And so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs. That's because until eight. <SEP> And so. Based on that who do you think you're talking to. You're talking to an employer. <SEP> Up until eighty-five or something was the.
