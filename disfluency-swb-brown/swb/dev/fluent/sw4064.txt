How do you feel about trial by jury? I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently. In what way? <SEP> In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence that's presented. I have very little regard for the law presently practiced. Do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits? <SEP> I was thinking primarily criminal cases. Do you think that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry. <SEP> That's a concern of mine. I would feel more comfortable in many cases with judges. Doing the sentencing. The only thing that really bothers me about that is I think that a judge can be. I like the idea of juries of your peers in that you get personally more than one person making a decision. And second of all you get a wide variety of background. So that. <SEP> My question are they really your peers? I'd agree with that. Too often I think they are not. That's definitely a problem. <SEP> And when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have that is a matter of concern to me too. <SEP> I think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased. Now I happen to know several judges. And there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury. I would feel a little bit uneasy about. <SEP> But the other two would give either the plaintiff or for the defendant the full benefit of the law. <SEP> And I guess that's what I am concerned with. I guess I definitely agree with you. But the. What I don't like about the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less. The same crime gets unequal sentences. <SEP> This is very true. I think there is more of an ability for selecting two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea versus whether he is guilty or innocent. <SEP> But I think there would be a large variation in trying to gage the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that measure stick across the board. And you do see such uneven sentencing evidence of it in the newspapers and such where it would appear the crimes were very similar. <SEP> But one individual got twenty-five years. And the other one was sentenced to life. So. <SEP> Of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to get a good lawyer. Isn't that the truth? <SEP> There are times when is it. My mind has gone blank it's Othello. You know where he says kill all the lawyers. Every now and then one is tempted to see what. I agree. <SEP> But it's taken me a long time to understand that lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as novices tend to think that attorneys care about justice. <SEP> I agree with it. They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty. It's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument. <SEP> And they are very effective too. That the. <SEP> Even. I have been involved just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty. But his attorneys gotten him off. <SEP> The city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge. So I don't know. This is a little bit of the subject. But one thing that I really dislike also that's new is that I have heard that there are federal sentences.
