. What's your view. <SEP> What's your view? I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally. <SEP> That's true. Even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place. <SEP> That's right. That's right. I don't know. Coming from Texas you're probably. I don't know. I shouldn't make stereo types. But gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think. It is. But I'm not really from Texas. I just live down here now. I've lived down here a couple years. You're just live down there? <SEP> I'm originally from Colorado. But. <SEP> There's a lot of hunters here. I know how you feel. I grew up in Nebraska. And we always use to go out and hunt all the time. And. There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons. That's just. I don't know. <SEP> I think it's ridiculous. It doesn't sit with me very well. I don't know anymore. I keep a thirty-eight in my truck. <SEP> I just about all. I live in Minneapolis. And I. Actually I live in Florida. But I am staying in Minneapolis for a year. And both areas are pretty crime ridden right now. <SEP> And it's just you never know who is out there. It's just for self protection purposes. And then of course there's the hunting issue. So. <SEP> That's good. What do you do Jeff? I'm in program control for a company up here. <SEP>. We do schedules for programs schedule programs. <SEP> What do you do? I'm researcher of Honeywell up here. You guys do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything. Or. <SEP> I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here. I don't own a shotgun. But I'd like to go bird hunting. That's something I miss quite a bit. <SEP> When I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting quite a bit. But. My brother was a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and really enjoyed it quite a bit. But I don't know. I guess that what the scale now is it's zero for a complete. <SEP> One for a total ban and. That's right. I guess I am about eight or nine. <SEP> I agree with you there. No doubt about it. But. If they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't. <SEP> I'm not for it. If there's a way to limited it to people that. I guess they passed a couple of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you go to buy a hand gun. <SEP> And then they actually. I know it's this way in Florida. They have a waiting period where you buy one. And that's a week. And then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record and things like that. I think that's a pretty good idea. And that's. I don't know. That's not a bad idea. But then again you can always get around that. You could go through the black market like you say. You always be able to get around. But. <SEP> It's one of things. But I don't know. I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon. I don't either. I'm just not. I think those have been pretty much banned altogether anyway. <SEP> I. There. Fully auto. But even a semiautomatic I guess that's. It kind of takes the sport out of hunting. <SEP>. It's what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with a seven or a twenty shot twelve. You might do the same thing. <SEP> And so it's like. It does. It takes the sport out of it. For me I would much rather have a bow anytime. I like bows. I have done some bow hunting. And I get into it. And I think it's more of a challenge. <SEP> But I don't know. I guess it keeps the shell makers in business. But I don't know. Anyway that's about where I stand. <SEP> Me too. You. I am about the same way. And have you eaten yet or whatever. <SEP> Is it seven o'clock there? It's about seven fifteen. You guys central? <SEP> How is the weather up there? It's not too good. It's kind of rainy actually. Is it? Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about ten or twenty degrees. <SEP> And it's been up around forty. So people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature. Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that. So. I am just up here for the year. And it's kind of shocking.
