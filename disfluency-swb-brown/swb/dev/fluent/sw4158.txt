Are you working right now? I am. I'm working in the computer science department here at C M U. <SEP> What kind of work do you do? I'm doing basically system design work and implementation work for the speech group here. <SEP> Wh-. Is that how you heard about this thing? <SEP> Actually through electronic mail. Me too. I work at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. <SEP> I'm a co-op student. So I work and go to school about halftime. And I really don't have any job benefits to speak of. We're kind of. I don't know. They just kind of forget us on that end. We don't really have any vacation or sick days or health care or anything really. So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away at this point. <SEP>. What about you? <SEP> I'm research stuff here now. So they have okay benefits package. It's not quite as good as industry. But one of the significant benefits here is that you can take up to two courses a semester. And they pay for the classes. So Carnegie Mellon that works out to be a reasonable benefit. <SEP> They do that if you're research here. Then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters. And I think that they might pay for that. Pay for the classes and stuff. But I know they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage. They'll let you work halftime if you want to finish. <SEP> If you want to do it quickly. You want to. They'll let you decrease your number of hours by any percentage just about so if you want to get your masters. And then I think of course with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due. So that will probably help out. <SEP> But Do you get any kind of health care type stuff? So I don't know in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary. I. <SEP> We do. We have to contribute a certain amount to it. And it's kind of split between C M U and the employee. <SEP> I think that's a pretty important part of it there because that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems. I think my. I'm still covered with my dad's health plan where he works. But it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own. <SEP> And right now it's the. Like everywhere else. Here in Pittsburgh the health care rates are going up pretty quickly. <SEP> That's a whole other topic to begin with too. They have. But. But you are right. I really agree that that's pretty important. I guess the only real benefit for me working here besides. I'm learning and stuff because I'm in school. <SEP> But there's some weird law where student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. <SEP>. Though that's about five percent right there. <SEP> That's a big win. So. <SEP> That's. That's about the only real bonus. So I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate how much I get paid real because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to pay an extra five percent or so. <SEP> I figured for. And they've just raised the income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying that as well. <SEP> If you could call it a benefit that C M U i-. The other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is consult for other companies. <SEP> So that kind of helps out in terms of keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry. <SEP> In case you ever need to bail out. Help a lot. Around here it's like. We pretty much work from project to project with different sponsors. <SEP> There is not a whole lot of funded research from.
