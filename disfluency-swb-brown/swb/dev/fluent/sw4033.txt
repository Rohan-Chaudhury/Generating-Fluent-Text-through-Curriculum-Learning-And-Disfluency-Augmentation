How do you get most of your current event information? I'm going to school right now. And while I'm working I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot. <SEP> And I don't watch T V as much really either because my free time is kind of. And I do like to do other stuff with it. While I'm at work sometimes on the computer network I read the news sometimes. <SEP> And that's kind of helpful. I would imagine going to college though your professors and different things. You keep up on what's going on. That's true. My roommates and stuff people around me talk about it. <SEP> And the people I work with are pretty up-to-date on that kind of stuff. So. I'm a housewife. I have three kids. And so I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then talking with people and just hearing what's going on. <SEP> Do you watch major network news. Or do you watch the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR? Just the regular channel just channel eight. <SEP> That's our channel here. That's the eyewitness news. <SEP>. Where I am channel eight's public T V. So it's kind of different. <SEP> I think a lot of the commentators on the major networks it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on. But it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they report on the news. And I think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not. And basically if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will kind of publicize his name. <SEP> I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on. Because they can only report on. They give each candidate perhaps ten second blurbs in which to say you just can't get a full picture of their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it. <SEP> And the news too it just doesn't cover that many stories. It just covers your basic violent crimes and your catastrophes with weather and stuff. But other than that you really don't know what's going on. <SEP> I will read our current letters that come out on elections. And I guess I do read that. And I do study who's running in our area. And I do study what's going on in the economy. It. And I guess I do read other magazines too to get my information. What kind of. I subscribe to SCIENCE NEWS. And that's real good because it gives a brief summary of or the updates of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would bog me down that I wouldn't know about. <SEP> But other than that I don't really read. I don't really subscribe to anything else. I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST. But now I guess I just have friends that clip articles. Or if I am interested in something of course when we were in war I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on. <SEP> But a lot of the times I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper. But I just can't seem to find the time. If they put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things. <SEP> But. <SEP> I remember back during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on because they were going constantly with that stuff. But. They even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of. And people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news. We just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas. <SEP> That we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's just more information. If they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would probably take the whole news hour. <SEP> But. I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the summer olympics. That's. Already they're having. In the newspaper they have a section every now and then on the Olympics. And they've got a countdown. It's sixteen hundred days or something. I know we're trying to get tickets to it right now. <SEP>. That's going to be crazy that time of year here. <SEP> But. I can't believe. They're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over. I guess people want to hear about it. Also big in the news right now is the Braves because they're in spring training or whatever. <SEP> And they did so well last year. They spend a long time on sports. And I think that that's fine I would like to see more time spent on other things. But. <SEP> It seems like. I don't know. They way they do the newscasts I wish they kind of separated it. If you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it. But I don't have cable.
