All right this is easy for me since I. And me too because I eat out a lot. Yeah. Well I travel. I do about forty percent of my time is on the road. <SEP> So you eat all your meals out. I eat a lot of meals out. Well I'm also married. And my wife is an A one cook. But she enjoys eating out. So I have to share it with her. And uh actually it's very easy for me because I I have a prac- make it a practice when I am out. I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here. Sure. So I look for just about anything. And it's it's uh it's a lot of fun. I don't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because I you know. <SEP> I was going to ask you could you go to you know nice places. And. Oh sure. Yeah. And it's it's really great. I I I like different types of food. <SEP> So where are your what are the places you know memorable places you've eaten? Uh oh you na- okay you name it. Let's see. You've got one down in uh down near uh Addison. Uh there's two restaurants that I particularly like that I every time I get into Texas or I get into Atlanta Georgia I make sure I go. And that's Houston's. Oh Houston's. Uh-huh. Yep. Okay. <SEP> It's a great place. It's it's great. There's a a restaurant in um right outside of Reading Pennsylvania it's called Alfredo's that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people. Uh-huh. But it is fab- fantastic. Uh there's a restaurant and I don't recall the name of it uh in uh Panama City. Of course not too many people want to rush back to Panama City uh Panama the country uh Panama. <SEP> Oh okay. Because I was thinking. Well I I grew up in Panama City. No. This is the country this is the country Panama all right? I get it. <SEP> Right. And uh but I have gotten to quite a few. And I go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there. I you know and I know the locations. And I know the places. But I lot of times I don't remember the names. I'd have to go back through some expense reports. Uh-huh. But particularly down in your area I'm looking for some some more restaurants. So I you know I don't know what's what's down there the ones out in Addison. <SEP> Do you like Mexican? Do you like Mexican food. Not particularly. <SEP> Oh. That's one of the few. Why which one were you going to recommend? Well I mean there's so many places here you know. There's just it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here. Uh-huh. <SEP> But in the Addison well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area anyway. Right. I mean now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi. Okay. I have a. <SEP> That has a great I've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas. And now there's one in Addison. Okay. Let. I'm I'm writing it down. It's F S it's S F U Z I. Okay. <SEP> And it's on it's in Addison. And it's a great place. Also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copelands. I've been there. Now I really like Copelands. Okay. I've been there. Um one down there is the uh I think it's an old schoolhouse. <SEP> Oh the yeah the I know. No. I don't like that place. Well I like the food. But I don't care for the clowning around. See uh uh. Yeah. I I when I went I thought the food was not good. <SEP> Oh really? Oh I've had. Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of. That's it. That's it. I've had excellent food there. <SEP> See I when I went I thought. The people drove me crazy first of all. True. True. <SEP> But then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was. Uh-huh. Yeah. All right. Well that's great. Uh no. Italian is fine. I make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there in Ad-. Do you like like Southwestern? Oh yeah. <SEP> Well now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's as a matter of fact. All right. Really? <SEP> And um it's great. I mean their they have I think. Sometimes I've been when I thought Well it wasn't as good. But I went there recently. And I thought Well this really is good. Uh-huh. So that's that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill. Good. <SEP> And um. Well this is great. This is going to give me some more places to go. A whole new dining experience. <SEP> Okay. Fine. I guess our time's about up. So. Well they haven't beeped us have they? Uh well they don't always. <SEP> Oh I thought sometimes they say you know this is three minutes or whatever. Yeah. I they've been doing that when uh the circuits are busy. <SEP> Oh okay. And other than that they you know leave you go about five minutes. And then that that's about it. I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat. So. Okay. It was a pleasure talking to you. <SEP> Well thanks for calling for helping us out. Okay. You bet. <SEP> Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
