Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Do you have recycling in Sachse? <SEP> Yes. We do. We've got uh a pickup twice a week that they come out. Do. And they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody. And they take it. Oh really? <SEP> Uh-huh. And it's twice a week? Uh-huh. Really? We have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh. <SEP> Used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up. And now they have uh these large green containers. And you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there. And then they haven't started curbside recycling yet. But they're but they're planning on doing it very soon. Apparently the trucks that they had um lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia. <SEP> Oh. And so that put off the program for a while. But uh do you recycle? Um my kids do. Do they? Uh-huh. <SEP> Put it that way. They they've been recycling cans for extra money. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So that's that's been their summer money. And they're fixing to go to Disneyland. So. Oh well. <SEP> So. That's great. Yeah. Well that's the way we started too. My daughter was going to Camp Goddard um which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall couple of years ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. And she had to earn money for it. And she was too young to baby-sit. So that's how she started. She started recycling cans. And from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and uh aluminum cans and plastics. <SEP> Really? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go. And they weigh it or whatever. <SEP> And. No. The only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans. Um. Um the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling. <SEP> And so you know we don't get paid for that. But that's okay. Yeah. You know it's it's not that much of a bother really. You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever. And we use a lot of two liter bottles. Um and like milk cartons and things like that. <SEP> It's amazing how much plastic you generate. Yeah. I was amazed at how many cans that we got. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Because when the kids first went down I said that you know that's great. And I was thinking you know maybe I'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in. Uh-huh. But it's amazing how many cans you go through. And how fast they accumulate. Yeah. It really is. <SEP> Well all that stuff. And how much how much we have reduced our waste. You know that we we're generating a week. Uh-huh. Um I know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week. They were real upset. But they weren't they were only picking up once a week. And we said to them if you recycle you'll you know you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container. <SEP> Yeah. And uh it's it's really amazing. The other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings. Really. No. He he got a little mulcher thing. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's just a little attachment for the lawn mower. And we mow once a week. You know no no more often then that. And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the uh the lawn. And it's amazing. It's amazing. We don't collect any of that. And that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out. Yeah. We don't e- we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard. So if it mows gets mowed I do it normally. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it. It's too heavy. Yeah. <SEP> So I just m- I just mow it and leave it. Yeah. It just soaks in. Sure it does. Sure it does. It really does. And it. Actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings. <SEP> Uh-huh. That that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Oh I like it better doing it. Well one. It cuts down on my mow time anyway. Uh-huh. That's true. And you zip through it quicker. That's true. That's true. Well I I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it. <SEP> Proba- we probably will. It's it's really not that much trouble. We keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage. Yeah. And as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there. And then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near Wal-Mart. <SEP> Uh-huh. They're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in. And it's really no trouble. And uh I feel like at least we're doing something. <SEP> Yeah. You know um I read a book one time or a m- a magazine article. And they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution. But it's not. If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would s- save thousands and thousands of trees a day. A day just from not throwing out your newspapers. Really. And uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know. <SEP> What what makes me sick is is when they show the dump sites you know and and how big they are. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river. Yes. <SEP> Yeah. And they don't have any place to put it. And it just floats in the. It's like ugh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's and that's really not necessary. <SEP> No. It really isn't. If everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference. It would make a huge impact. So I'm excited about the recycling program in Plano. I I can't wait for them to get it started. Um because it'll be that much easier for us. You know like I said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart. It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up. <SEP> Yeah. It it's it's convenient out here for them to do it. Um. Now what what do they pick up? It's just. <SEP> They pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper. Oh they do? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And do you have to sort that? <SEP> And they will do the alum-. Or do you just put it all in. No. You just put it in the one bin. And and I guess they do the sorting. But um they'll do the aluminum cans too. But we don't give them those. Right. Right. <SEP> The kids keep those. So. So you're doing that now? You're doing the newspapers and the glass? Uh-huh. Well we don't we don't take the newspaper to begin with. When neither one of us are home t- to read it. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> So we don't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass. At first when it first started it it it was hard. You know because you're just used to throwing things. Uh-huh. My husband would come home and go through the trash and say you threw this away. <SEP> Uh !. <SEP> He would get he would get all upset. And I'd say. It's just such an automatic reaction. And now we think before we throw anything away. It is. I mean it's really funny. We we really. Once you get into the habit of it it's okay. It's just it's just making it a habit that's hard. <SEP> Oh I know. Well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're oh no don't do that. And they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain. And and then uh after a couple of days they take them all outside. Uh-huh. And I put them in a big bag anyway. Uh-huh. <SEP> And then they dump the bag out. And then they crush them. So that's their activity thing. To go out there and crush. Uh-huh. That's fun. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> So. Yeah. Oh that's a lot of fun. Yeah. That's a lot of fun. Well that's great. Well I'm to hear you're doing that. <SEP> I. My sister was here recently from Connecticut. And they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans. Oh really?
