I really haven't seen any movies lately. So when the computer picked this one I was a little bit surprised. But I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about oh six months. But uh you know the last movies that I've seen were probably on video. Oh well that's. We rent a lot of videos too. Yeah. <SEP> Uh we saw. I have two little babies. And we saw one movie recently. And that was THE TERMINATOR movie uh which I didn't like after all. Uh-huh. Yeah. Now I ha- I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie. But and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it. I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff. <SEP> Well I don't either. It. On all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie. He doesn't. He maims them. Yeah. Right. So. Yeah. He maims them pretty good doesn't he? <SEP> Uh-huh. He he uh I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part. In the movie. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> So. I I saw uh SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. Uh Uh I saw it uh. Oh I haven't seen that one yet. Oh couple weeks ago I rented it and uh watched it. And I was I was pretty disappointed in it. Because I I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I was pretty disappointed in it. Oh. Now it's a good movie. But I guess that they built me up too much. For my expectations in it there. <SEP> Yeah. Well With all the commercials and everything. Uh-huh. <SEP> I haven't. That's one we want to see. I I want to see uh DANCES WITH WOLVES. Uh-huh. But we haven't seen that one yet either. Yeah. Now I haven't seen it either. But uh I've heard that it's real long. That it's a good movie but it's long like three hours. <SEP> Yeah. Th- that's what I heard too. Yeah. We've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it. That's right. So We saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone OSCAR. That's right. <SEP> OSCAR. Supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy. Uh-huh. <SEP> Which was an interesting movie but not very funny. Yeah. I know my daughter saw that. And she liked it. So. Did she? Yeah. <SEP> Well it was it was an amusing movie. Uh-huh. It j-. I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to uh just at the house watching it with with no one else around. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. And of course I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and WHO'S LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO. And because I have a ten year old. So We we watch a lot of movies around that category you know that she that she can watch. <SEP> Oh. Uh-huh. <SEP> My son just turned two. And so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie. Yeah. We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID too. LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think are are his two favorites that we've got. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And there's some I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video uh SHIPWRECKED. Oh I haven't I didn't hear that was coming out. Uh-huh. Yeah. It's fixing to come out on video. And boy I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out. <SEP> Well they just had uh THE RESCUERS movie. But. Uh-huh. <SEP> That was a Disney movie wasn't it. I think I heard that was just one was just out. He's uh he doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet. But he likes to uh to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the m- in the movie. Right. Uh-huh. Well I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater. <SEP> Well I w- tell you ever s-. My my kids are just small babies. And I tell you we really want to go a lot. Yeah. And uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know. The movie comes out quicker than you can go see it. Sometimes. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's right. And then they go to the dollar movies. So. <SEP> Uh-huh. That seems to happen. I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the uh Granada Theater. Uh-huh. And uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do. You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie. I thought that might be kind of fun to do. Yeah. That does sound fun. <SEP> And of course you need a baby-sitter for that. Definitely. But uh no. I'd really like to get out to the movies more often. Course it's so expensive now too that you can't hardly afford it. Right. I I know we get discount tickets where my husband works. Uh-huh. <SEP> But other than that it just seems like it's so expensive. And then the popcorn and everything else. You almost can't afford to do it. No matter what. That's right. Although we did actually get. We went on vacation couple months ago. And we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB? Uh-huh. <SEP> That was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. Uh-huh. That was fun. Golly. I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie. <SEP> Oh he's a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist. And Bob is his patient. And Bob follows him on vacation. It's uh. Oh that's the that's the one where they burn down the house or something. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. The house explodes? <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh okay. Yeah. That's the one. Okay. Yeah. Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is uh oh. I just forgot the title of it. Uh. Oh it's supposed to be a real scary one. Uh darn. Well here here's another one that I've seen. I saw uh. I can't remember the title of it either. <SEP> Must have left an impression.
