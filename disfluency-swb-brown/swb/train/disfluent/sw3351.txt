Yeah. <SEP> I've had a Burmese python. I've had rats. I've had mice. Wow. Uh let's see. I've had gerbils. I have I had a son he's now gone from the home that was an animal lover. Uh-huh. <SEP> So at one point I had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house. Wow. Um do the skunk uh was it kind of like a cat to have around the house? <SEP> Yes. Yeah. It was litter trained. Yeah. <SEP> And we had it perfumed. Uh-huh. And uh it was very aggressive. Right. <SEP> But all the all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house. Uh-huh. And the skunk. And the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa. Oh yeah. <SEP> Um. Nobody came near it when he was there. Oh. Uh I had I had a dog one time. And uh he chased after a after a skunk and got sprayed. <SEP> Oh. So we had to we had to give him a tomato tomato juice bath and uh get him cleaned up. Yeah. They um ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them. But the glands had been removed. Uh-huh. <SEP> So. Right. But I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready. Right. <SEP> One other question we had is Why do you have pets? Yeah. Why I don't know. I I think they're kind of nice to have. They're kind of you know just relaxing to I don't know to pet and to. I don't know.

Um do you like big dogs or or little dogs? <SEP> Well we had a German Shepherd. And he had dysplasia. Uh-huh. <SEP> And he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went. Really. So when he died we got a little one.

We uh we used to live in an apartment. And like our cats never went outside. But um the neighbors used to let their dogs out. And our neighbors were I don't know kind of slimy. And uh our cats wound up getting fleas uh from the apartment that we were in. Um. So we had to we had to flea bath them. And it was uh it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all. <SEP> Yeah.
