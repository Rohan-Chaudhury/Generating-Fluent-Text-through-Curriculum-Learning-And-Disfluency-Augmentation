Okay. What are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful. Have a big family I guess. That's a start. Well I guess so. <SEP> Have you had any in the la- ha-. Well how old are you? Twenty-five. So. Okay. So you ha- you have been to some family reunions perhaps. <SEP> I just got married. Right. Every four years on one side of my family they plan on having uh like my p- grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids. Now how long in advance do they uh let them know? <SEP> Well we plan on it. It's like the third weekend in August. Uh-huh. So it's every four years. And so. So they all know it. <SEP> Yeah. And then you know arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know um food and who's who's staying where because a lot of people fro- are from down here in Texas. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And uh a lot of my family is in Indiana. That's where I'm originally from. Yes. <SEP> So um we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the um at the lake and uh make a couple days of it. Well that sounds like fun. Do they all have the small children too that come? Yeah. Pretty much. So all ages. <SEP> Yeah. And uh you know there's some my age. And then there are some a lot younger an about four generations I guess. Well my husband has uh on one side has an extended family. Uh-huh. And they don't ever plan it li- as like you do. <SEP> Uh-huh. I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind. So they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because they're rather socially active too. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And so it has it seems by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there. If they don't you know they'll say oh we're planning to go so and so that go to to a certain place that weekend with somebody else. And we're already locked in. But six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them. Uh-huh. My family uh my parents are the youngest of very large families. <SEP> Oh. Therefore they don't have many people left. Yeah. And uh the few previous ones I've had uh. I haven't known many of those people. But uh in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family. And that's been very nice. With uh. I have one sister and three brothers. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they're only three out of five of us who have children. Oh. So uh we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other. <SEP> Yeah. And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large. Uh-huh. And they don't see each other very often. We don't really know many of them. <SEP> Yeah. That's kind of bad. It really is. They're fun. They're a lot of fun. Yeah. But uh still uh they're not done on a regular basis. And uh you kind of forget what happened and who they were from the time before. <SEP> Yeah. It's it's fun getting together with immediate family. A lot of my cousins are real close. And we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that. So. Uh those are the ones that are in Texas? Uh no. Or you go to Indiana on that? <SEP> The ones in Indiana. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Where in Indiana? Lafayette. Lafayette I don't know where. I used to live in Indianapolis. <SEP> Yeah. It's a little north of Indianapolis about an hour. Yeah. Yeah. It's very pretty country in there I think. It's gorgeous. Uh-huh. So. Well I. Uh when is your next one uh scheduled now. <SEP> Well it's like the last one was my high school graduation. The next one was when I graduated from college. So I guess about two more years. Yes well. And do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you. Uh maybe. I don't know. Maybe. <SEP> Two more years. I don't know. Probably. I mean you need another milestone you know. Yeah. I guess that's that's what. I mean I've been married now for about nine months. So that was another milestone I guess. Yes. Well I'm sure. And ha- then all of your family probably has not met your husband. <SEP> Um yeah. He's from Indiana. Oh is he? So they all met. Yeah. And and he's living you're both living in Sherman. <SEP> Yeah. Do you work to T I? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And does he? <SEP> No. He's trying to get in med school. So. Uh-huh. Well we don't either. But uh I have a friend who uh is working on this project. Oh really. Yes. And. <SEP> Are they getting all the data they need? Well I don't know uh. I I have a hard time getting uh people on the telephone. Oh really. Uh-huh getting through to anybody. Sometimes I call off and on all day. <SEP> Huh. But anyway uh I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we. But I got off that. <SEP> Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess. Yes. Well um I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes. Oh okay. And uh uh we both look forward to going to our next reunions I'm sure. <SEP> Oh yeah. But it has been fun talking to you. Well you too. Thank you. <SEP> And maybe I'll talk to you again. Okay. Good. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
