Okay um. Let's see. How do you feel about credit cards? Personally I do not care for them. Uh although I find them a necessity in business and so forth. I I try to refrain from their use as much as possible. Um for a number of reasons one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them. Uh-huh. <SEP> The one I use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know American Express. Right. And uh I'm not I'm not terribly in favor of them. Not for my own personal uh point of view. Right. <SEP> Plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion I believe. Yeah. Right. <SEP> Wow. Uh at least that's one number for this range of numbers I have I have heard. Right. <SEP> Do you use them frequently. Or. Well we uh me and my wife when when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah we'll we'll use it. But like last year I think we paid. I think it was like twenty something cents interest on our Visa. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I think this this year we uh I think we used it for Christmas. And we got caught just a few days on our grace period. And uh so we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars. But we don't like to do that at all. Yes. And you know we I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly. We uh we have several credit cards though. We have a gas card our Visa and then of course the American Express. And I think we have a couple of department stores. <SEP> Uh-huh. But we use it the same way. And uh. I find the one I use mostly uh. Aside from the American Express I do use my Sears card. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh I try a- as with the American Express I try to pay it you know as it comes in. Right. Right. So uh. It's it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill. That's usually how we do it. <SEP> I know when I travel or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit what I would do on my American Express card is before I would before I left I would mail a check to to American Express and you know have some idea of how much was there you know I'd sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever I felt I would spend. And then use it then. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> But uh for hotels and and so forth. But uh but I knew that it was paid. I knew I knew that I had that much credit going in. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Sometimes you know sometimes I would go over. But it wouldn't you know it wouldn't hit me in a big in a big way because I knew that uh I would have it covered in that respect. Right. Right. That's good. I've I don't think we've gone that far to pay it in ad- you know in advance before we spend it. <SEP> But I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good. Well I found I found in um in traveling overseas that uh often it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card for hotel bills and so forth. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh really. <SEP> Yeah. Plus I would uh when they uh would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate. Right. Right. <SEP> So now the only time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically. Uh-huh. Uh for example I remember on one trip to France when I started planning the trip I think uh a dollar was worth nine or ten. Francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically. Uh-huh. <SEP> And whe- when I finally got over there it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar. So the. Wow. So I got caught a little short in that regard. Wow. <SEP> But uh uh I I was anticipating you know my room would cost uh let's say. Yeah. If it were say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so or maybe twenty dolls-. Right. <SEP> Maybe it would be more than that. It was more than. It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate. Right. Right. <SEP> But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time. Uh-huh. Of course the government was several months behind in their on its per diem for exchange rate. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Right. So there's a little consternation you know in trying to get them to compensate for the difference in the exchange rate. Yeah. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Especially. That was the only time I really got caught short. And I But as I said most most of all I try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well tha- that's good. Well from where are you calling? Oh from the Dallas area. <SEP> So you're from Dal-. Okay. I'm from Maryland. Oh really. Yeah. Wow. Do you work for T I? <SEP> No. I work for G T E. Well really. Yes. Um. I wonder how T I got G T E involved. <SEP> Well I know Jack Godfrey. Oh okay. I know him very well. I've known Jack for a long time. And I'm also in the speech business. Oh okay. <SEP> So when I heard that Jack was going to do this I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's how I got involved. Yeah. You have a very um very. What's the word. Your your speech is very exact. <SEP> Oh. Thank you very much. But as Jack said I'm one of the the old hands in the speech business. Oh really. Yeah. Uh. Yes. I I've been doing it for twenty some odd years. Wow. <SEP> And so uh I was very much interested uh in getting involved in uh switchboard. Yeah. So uh you work for T I? Right. I work in. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. I guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording. Yeah. I think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject. So I think you get ten. So I think we're okay. <SEP> Alright. Okay. Fine. Well you have a good evening. Well you too. It's been pleasant talking to you. Same here. <SEP> Take care. Good night. Bye.
