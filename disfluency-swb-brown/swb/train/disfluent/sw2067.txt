Well um with credit cards is me I uh I try to get maybe just one or two. I don't I don't like having credit cards for every store. I I uh I just don't like them. What are you afraid of with them? What am I afraid of? <SEP> Yes. Um I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much. I just uh don't think that I need them you know. I. Uh they are tempting at times. But I I just you know sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know. So. <SEP> Well that's very can be very very true. So and th- you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money. So. Well that's the idea. They figure that if they give you card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And. That's right. See they make money off of it whether you use it or not. <SEP> Absolutely. Well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you would be paying interest. That's right. <SEP> Uh-huh. I use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that I can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's what I do. Right. That's what I do. Just a second. Sorry. <SEP> That's all right. Sounds like you have a little one there. I have two little ones. Yes. Oh you have. Yeah. So tha-. <SEP> Great. How old are they? Um four and two and half. Oh boy. Those are two very active ages. Yes. So yeah. Um I'm I'm like you. I I use my only use my credit card for um you know when I you know. I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check. And then but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. Well uh do you uh do you ever use the A T M machines? No. I never do. My husband does at work just to get cash out. But uh I take the checkbook. So I you know I just if I need cash I just tell him. And he gets it out. And I don't even think I know my number. <SEP> Well I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash. Uh-huh. That's right. See we he couldn't do without it h- but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing. <SEP> Oh that helps. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their A their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash. Uh-huh. And when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on. You're right. And that's kind of silly. <SEP> Yeah right. Absolutely. Yeah. Because they they figure that that's correct. You're defeating the purpose. <SEP> The idea is to use their money. Yeah. <SEP> And uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I get I get at least one or two a week. People t- you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Because I. <SEP> Well I think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted. Yeah. It's like I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line. You know. <SEP> Well i-. You've already been preapproved. Oh absolutely. Preapproved. That's their favorite word. Yes. Everybody in the country is preapproved I think. <SEP> I think so you're right. So. Well it's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view. Of credit cards no matter where you go. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> And then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow I didn't realize I had this much you know I'd spent this much money. That much stuff. <SEP> Right. And then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it. Well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem. Yeah. It does because you're you know you you're you know you're just co- costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the monthly the minimum payment you're paying interest again. That's right. So. <SEP> That's right. Yeah. So. Well it's been enjoyable talking with you. Yeah. It's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way. So well. <SEP> Right. Well take good care. Take care of your little ones. You you too. Good luck. Uh-huh. Bye-bye. <SEP> Bye-bye.
