Uh Robert what do you uh think what substances do you think are the most uh likely causes of air pollution? Um gee. I don't I mean. I I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust you know. They say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that. Right. <SEP> So I believe them. But I'm not a chemist. Do you uh do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai- acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from uh industrial areas factories and so on? I don't really know um. I grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like I was victimized by air pollution. I was going to say. And and you so you understand smog. <SEP> I understand it very well. And in fact I was a private pilot there. Uh-huh. And I can remember very etched etched clearly in my mind uh flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and and really being unbelieving at what looked like a uh. Wow. <SEP> It just looked liked peanut butter. My word. Thick and brown and so on. And that was a few years ago? <SEP> This was quite a few years ago. This was in the nineteen sixties. I I wonder if it's any better now. Because they uh California has such strict rules um about emissions and so on. People say that it is somewhat better. <SEP> Right. Um I I don't know if you he- re- heard about the uh recent legislation in uh Colorado uh against a power company uh that's actually on Indian land I believe. But uh it has been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon. And um particularly in the winter months. Um. So they. It was uh a landmark case because it's unusual to um. I can. They they were talking about shutting it down or if it didn't comply and so on. <SEP> So did it burn coal? I don't know that. The information is one of those wire services kind of news pieces of news you know. So it's hard. I never did see the full story. So I don't know. Yeah. But they said that that it really caused so much smog over uh the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing. Which would be horrible because the there's nothing. <SEP> Um. Yeah. I mean that's such a spectacle. It would be a shame to ruin it. <SEP> Yeah. Uh what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem. Uh I don't uh I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals. Uh maybe just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing. Um. Right. <SEP> Apart from that I I don't know what we can do as individuals. What do you think we can do? Uh-huh. You think it's more more to society. Well I guess I kind of agree there. I uh. On an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things. But if we are concerned about it then we certainly can uh force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it. Yeah. And I do think that we have a responsibility there. I must admit I'm not always real politically active. But I do think that um Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards. <SEP> Yeah. And it's brought the. They uh really listen to. The the uh lobbyist and uh the car manufacturing companies have uh you know have really pushed. They. All those re- restrictions are really too hard. We can't we can't quite make that go. And they don't. And then we still live with air pollution. Yeah. Um so I suspect that that's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators. But um as a society I think we can do more. And that's probably how we ought to do it. Uh individ- being individually responsible as uh gro- in order to be group responsible. <SEP> Yeah. I guess I'm I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless unless there's something economically justifiable about it. Right. And in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to uh to get rid of the source of it. Uh-huh. <SEP> I suspect that the pub- that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it. And probably the only way that can happen is for um governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't. Yeah. And uh I don't know how long that that will take. <SEP> People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it. So if you don't want to burn coal for power how about nucle- nuclear energy. Sure. Well we don't want that either. Exactly. Yeah. Right. <SEP> How about investing in the sun. Well nobody wants to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour I don't think. Right. Uh I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it. Well it's just the same thing with the car uh uh the gasoline. Now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't uh run into the kind of problems we recently had. <SEP> Oh yes. Yes. Yes. And yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent. And they don't want they don't want to pay for it. So instead we spend billions of dollars going to war. Yes. Uh you know wha-. However it might have had other causes. Certainly oil was a big factor. <SEP> Oh certainly. Yes. Um and I think that's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution when we when we se- get serious about cleaning about our motors in our automobiles then uh then maybe you know we'll have a little bit of help. Um uh. Yeah. Do you have any air pollution in your area? <SEP> There's not really a lot here in Raleigh. Uh once in a while we'll get some uh. I think it kind of washes down from uh from your area Linda. Oh no. That's what they that's what they. You're talking about from from the uh the middle middle states that that have more factories and so on. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they say. But it's it's not it's not very usual. And certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities. Yeah. We really don't have that either. Although I think I can tell a difference in I lived in this area for about twenty-five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level uh particularly in the summer. Uh you know when it gets hot and you have the that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air uh usually they say caused by exhaust. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable. And you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on. So I suspect that it's it's an ever growing problem. <SEP> Yeah. Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here. Right. I think we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch. It was nice talking to you. <SEP> And I enjoyed the conversation. So did I. Bye bye. Bye.
