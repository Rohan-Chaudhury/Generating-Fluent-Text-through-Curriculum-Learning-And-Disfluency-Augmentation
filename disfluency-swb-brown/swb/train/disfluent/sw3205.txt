The question was on lawn and garden work. Um how do you like it? Well I don't do much of it here. I'm from uh Te- from uh Colorado originally. And there are no bugs there. And I didn't mind getting in the dirt there. But boy I'll tell you what. Once I see these bugs around here I'm just kind of out of it. Oh what kind do you have? <SEP> Oh roaches and. Do they really? Oh yes. Cockroaches are awful here. Oh. <SEP> Just awful. So I. Oh and I know somebody that lives there. And they never mentioned that problem. Oh you're kidding you're kidding. No. It's a d-. Well maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here. And uh. Oh my. They probably just take it for granted then. <SEP> It must be. If they lived here a lot of people I know just say oh I just stomp on them. It doesn't matter. They make good fertilizer in the garden. Oh yuck. Me personally can't. I don't have that problem uh. It's. Mine is mainly. We kind of have an understanding that uh I I said I'll do inside work you do outside work. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so I get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I don't like I don't like it dirty. No. I have to you know I have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really. No. I don't know. We got the we got the question. And I thought oh this is going to be interesting. Two bits I'll get a man to talk to me because they get stuck doing it all. <SEP> But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work. And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home. So um we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall. <SEP> Huh. Today we just had a lot of rain. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. So it's kind of nice. I don't know how yours has been. Well it's been real hot here lately. I mean we've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything. But uh doe-. It's supposed to rain again now uh this weekend. Oh I see. <SEP> So then. Okay. Well we're leaving tomorrow. And we're going down to New Orleans. And from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie. This is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there. Yeah. And I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity. But um as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know uh too much too much about uh how much I really r- do enjoy it myself. <SEP> Yeah. Do you like it at all? I well not here. I mean it's just here. I just can't stand to even get out in the uh in the dirt. Just. Well how about when you were in Colorado? <SEP> Well I liked it a little bit. But I didn't uh. I was working at that time full-time and didn't have a lot of time for that. Uh-huh. And so that I think really um hampered it a little bit. Well and then too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly. My water bill was high. And uh if you have that on a regular basis in Texas I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off you know. <SEP> Yeah. But uh and with children um you probably don't have time anyhow to to get into it. No. <SEP> Not really. It's so uh okay very good. Uh-huh. I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we? <SEP> Sounds like i-. No. No. Afraid not. Uh hopefully they'll give a subject I like one of these times. Something I really know a lot about. Right. Okay. <SEP> Right. Wh-. Nice talking to you. Nice talking with you. <SEP> Okay. Bye-bye. Uh-huh. Bye.
