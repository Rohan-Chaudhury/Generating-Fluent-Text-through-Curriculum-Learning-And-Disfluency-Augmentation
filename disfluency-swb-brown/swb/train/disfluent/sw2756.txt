And uh what part of Virginia uh? Uh I live down in the south western part of Blacksburg. Blacksburg. Okay. I've been. <SEP> Uh-huh. Have you ever heard of Virginia Tech? Sounds vaguely familiar. V P I. Yeah. Okay. <SEP> Yeah. Okay. I I hadn't been down in that part of the state really. Uh-huh. Okay. Well we vacation a lot. How about you? Quite frequently. Uh I wish we did. <SEP> Well we retired early. Oh okay. So we're we take trips pretty often. Where all you guys go? <SEP> Well we go to Maine every Fall. Uh-huh. Then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast. Uh-uh. <SEP> And I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico. So we go out there. And we go to Florida. Uh. And down oh. We were just out recently at the outer banks of North Carolina. All these places that I've never been. <SEP> Is that right. Where do you go? Uh. What type of vacation? Well it really depends. I mean uh seems like I do a lot in the Midwest lately. Uh my uh fiancee's family's from Wisconsin. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so we've been out there a couple of times. And uh I uh went to Purdue for a couple of years. So I've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends. Uh-huh. And uh uh I'm a real big baseball fan. So I usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere. <SEP> Uh-huh. What club do you follow? I'm uh I'm a big Red Sox fan. Red S-. Good. But uh I uh. <SEP> Me too. Uh you're a Red Sox fan too? Yeah. Uh-huh. I usually try to catch whoever's in town though I don't specifically. I you know go to Cleveland to see them play the Indians or the Red Sox. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh uh that's about it. We don't I mean we do a lot of little trips around here uh. And uh. Ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains. Or. Not that much. We've gone out to um uh a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water. <SEP> Oh. Uh have you ever heard of it? I've heard of it. I've never been there. Yeah. It's it's really neat. It's this house built on on a waterfall. And it's uh really cool. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there. Uh the first time we went out there was uh the day after hurricane Hugo had come through. <SEP> Gee. So I mean they they didn't have any power. And it was really cold and and rainy. And uh we went up about a year later. And it was better but not a whole lot better. Uh-huh. So uh where else did we go uh. We've gone to Richland last year and uh had a good time down there. <SEP> Oh did you? Did you go to Williamsburg. <SEP> Have you been down there? Uh my girlfriend has with her sisters. But I haven't been down there. Uh-huh. Uh I hear that's nice. We're going to get down probably down Norfork sometime this Summer just to see why catch a football game actually. <SEP> Uh-huh. We were down. Well when we came back from the outer banks we came up due Norfork and spent the night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night. Uh spend a day and a lot of money. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I've heard uh. I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the of the price attached to it. Yeah. We just. We. I. <SEP> But it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around if you like to walk. It's a good town to just walk in. Uh. Uh yeah. We'll do that. <SEP> You can go to the buildings and not go in if you're not. Oh okay. So I can wander around without. <SEP> Yeah. You can wander. It's a good town to wander in. Oh okay. I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings? That's right. Oh okay. I didn't know that. Yeah. I think uh they do the whole with you know paying. <SEP> Yeah. They really did throw away a lot of money to get getting one thing or another. Yeah. But they had a good time. So. <SEP> We really didn't do that really this time we just uh visited around. Uh uh. We've done it a couple of times. And that's enough for uh probably another twenty years. Yeah. I was uh. We use it live in California. And uh my um. Up up around San Francisco. And uh there was one year when my father was uh my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles. So my father was working down in Los Angeles for like uh six months or so. Uh actually I think it was closer I think to a full year. And you know we'd he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays. Well any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles. So I saw I went to Disneyland about five times in one year. <SEP> Oh. And I really have no great urge to go back now. That's great as a kid though isn't it I mean. Oh it was great because uh well the times that were really fun were when uh we had vacation. But the kids in Los Angeles didn't. <SEP> Uh-huh. So we basically had one of the parks. Right. Uh Disneyland I mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland. But there was another um another amusement park down there Busch Gradens uh. There was nobody there when we were there we got we won a log floating ride like five straight times. We just get get done with them and they go oh do you want to go again. <SEP> Sure. Have you ever. You've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney. No. I'd like to sometime. <SEP> That's good. But. We we really enjoy that. We've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter. Yeah. I've never been. The fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte. <SEP> Oh. So I um keep wanting to get further. You know I thought I would go to Florida a couple Summers ago. Uh-huh. But never did it. <SEP> Charleston is a really nice place to visit. My uh my sister lives in Charlotte. And they've gone to Charleston a couple of times and had a real good time. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It's a real pretty place. Uh yeah. One of these days we'll get down there although. I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it. <SEP> We're uh we're getting married in about a year. Oh are you. And our honeymoon we're going up to this um uh place in Wisconsin called Door County. <SEP> Yeah. It's up by Green Bay. It's a place my girlfriend's also wanted to go. Uh-huh. And uh. <SEP> Is it on uh one of the lakes? It's um uh. I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin. But there's kind of like a little a little thing sticking out uh in the Lake Michigan. Uh-huh. That's Door County. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. That would be really nice. So. Yeah. They call it the Cape Cod of the uh the Midwest. <SEP> Oh. So uh we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun. Uh-huh. She uh she had this uh book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide. <SEP> Uh-huh. Sounds good. So uh that should be a lot of fun. Well I don't know what our next trip will be I guess our next. Well I know what my next trip I'm going to be a grandmother in July. Oh. <SEP> The first the first one. Oh boy. So my next trip is going to be to Texas. Oh that'll be fun. <SEP> Yeah. In the middle in the middle of the Summer. Well yeah. You won't even notice it though. <SEP> Well they'll be air-conditioning anyway. So. Is that is that how you got into this uh this you know uh data base? Yeah. <SEP> My daughter's a temp at Texas Instruments and working on this project. Oh okay. Yeah. I was I was just. I mean most of the people I've talk to are from are from Texas. <SEP> Uh-huh. So when I you know when I heard you were from Virginia I was like oh okay there's somebody different. And you said oh I got somebody down in Texas. I go okay that the connection right there. That's it. Yeah. <SEP> I talked to one in California. I never asked him the other day how he was connected. I don't think he was T I employee. Uh I uh. Most people talk to Texas. There's been a couple of other the people uh most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are going to use data base eventually. Oh I see. So uh it was fun. I actually yesterday I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in. <SEP> Is that right. Well we spent last week end in Charlotte with real good friends that had just moved to back East from Oklahoma. Oh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And she's uh working on this project too. I mean she's talking on the project too. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh we got back Monday. And I got a call yesterday. And it was her on T I Network. Uh that's neat. I haven't uh I haven't had something like that happen just uh just getting the one guy from the lab. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh you're sure have a nice town. Uh my uh sister lives on Lake Norman just. Oh does she. <SEP> That's nice out there. Yeah. Uh we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the Summer. And it's never really works out. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It's real pretty. Yeah. Well. Traffic not much else we do for vacation really. Uh just so we don't haven't been able to take really. <SEP> Are you a golfer? No. No. Me either. No. Are you guys golfers. <SEP> No. Uh-huh. Or uh.
