Okay. Okay. What's what's your most recent one that you've seen? <SEP> Well actually what I do. I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months. Uh-huh. So I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater. But I rent probably four or five movies a week. Really. I used to do that too. But I haven't been doing it lately. But. <SEP> We've got a good video place out here. And uh uh oh gosh uh I'm just trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen. Uh. Oh AIR AMERICA. No. See I haven't seen that one uh. Have you seen WILD ORCHID? No. Is it good? <SEP> Well it depends. Do you like uh steamy movies. Uh no. Not ye-. I know that sounds funny coming from a woman. But usually I don't. Oh okay. What type of movies do you like? Um action. <SEP> Bu- d-. I I guess one of my favorite well two of my favorite movies is probably like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO. Okay. And those are those are like two of my most favorite. I mean they're just really good movies. And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE. And movies like that. <SEP> Yeah. Do you like suspense movies. Or do you like uh just action. Or. Um yeah. Some I guess like. What do you mean. Like like are you talking about movies like DIE HARD TWO. <SEP> Oh JAGGED EDGE. JAGGED EDGE was a suspenseful one. Or uh FATAL ATTRACTION. Okay. Yeah. I liked that. That was pretty good. Um that was okay. I I don't I guess I thought it was too far fetched. But so many people said oh no it wasn't you know. But I guess. <SEP> Oh well I hope I don't run across them. Really. That's true because. I don't know. I just didn't find that one to be real. I I just thought it was too far fetched. What was your favorite all time movie? Um oh gosh I don- I can't think off my head. Do you know which one yours was? <SEP> I I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most uh that I was really the most in shock with was probably uh STAR WARS. Oh yeah. Well that's. When that first came out I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that. Right. <SEP> I mean I guess uh out of all the movies I've I've never been as excited to go back. I was ready to go back and see it again you know. Really. Yeah. Yeah. You're right about that. But that that's really like an all time classic. I mean I don't think anybody anything could ever beat that. Now I I also liked uh oh GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. See I've never seen that. <SEP> Oh you haven't? No. Should I rent it? Oh yeah. Should I go rent it tomorrow. <SEP> No. That's uh that's a that's a real interesting movie. And it's got a good historical perspective to it. That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school. Oh yeah. So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see. Oh. <SEP> Actually I just saw a movie uh called THE LOST CAPONE. And it's about Al Capone's brothers. Primarily one of his brothers. Oh really. <SEP> And I won't give the the whole plot away. But it's it's really a good movie. Uh. Al Capone had three brothers. Uh-huh. And one of them was lost for many many years. And uh he actually he turns out to be a law man. Really. <SEP> Yeah. It's really interesting. It. Oh you just gave it away. I guess I can't go see it. No. No. That's okay. I didn't give away the whole thing. I just gave away just enough to get you interested. That does sound good. Is it one. I guess it's a rental. <SEP> Yeah. It is. Okay. I may have to do that. Go see it. Or go rent it. And a lot of times what I wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress and seeing like all. Yeah. <SEP> I've seen all of James Dean's movies. Uh all of Mae West's movies. Uh-huh. And just kind of kind of go out and uh rent all the movies and uh uh you know just kind of go. I guess you could do that you know get all of David Carradine's movies or uh uh Segal. Uh-huh. <SEP> To. What's his first name. I can't remember his first name. Um it's not David is it? Is it David Segal. I don't know. He was on uh on uh uh Arsenio just recently. Oh I don't I don't watch that. Um. <SEP> It was really kind of interesting because Arsenio was asking him about uh what he thought of uh one of the other action guys. Really. God I can't even remember the name. He said well he wouldn't really talk about it. Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a uh a good action guy. Huh. <SEP> It wasn't Stallone. It was uh. I can't remember. Shoot I can't remember the guy's name. But I like all the the RAMBO movies. Oh see I didn't really care that's that's one side of the action I guess that I didn't really care for. But see I don't really like Sylvester Stallone. Yeah. I don't think he's really a very good actor. I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful. But I just have never been a Stallone fan. <SEP> Yo Adrian. Hey that's pretty good. No. I guess like I say. I just have I don't know I just have never seen any interest in him. But. <SEP> No. We we actually rent uh probably a go- good combination of movies with the exception of horror films. Oh. Don't watch really very many horror films at all. Yeah. I don't either. <SEP> You know I don't know. There's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something you know coming out of the T V that just doesn't make my day you know. Yeah. You're right. Well it's so. I guess I'm a real I'm a realist and so when I watch movies like that it's like this can not happen. So I just don't enjoy it you know because it's just like come on give me a break. <SEP> Yeah. You know I mean I just. And so many of them are done so poorly. Yeah. You know that it just doesn't even give you the effect. I mean some of them are done good. And they do scare you. But um so many of them are just done real. I don't know. I'm not really into those. <SEP> I just saw uh uh a really interesting movie called uh FLATLINERS. Oh that was one of my favorites. Yes. I thought that was a very good movie. <SEP> Yeah. I was really impressed with that one. I mean it was what I liked about it was that it was a new subject. Nobody had ever touched it before. Yeah. You know and it was just it was done so well you know. It was just. <SEP> It was just crazy enough for th-. You know students might try to do it. You know I mean and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it. Right. Well that's probably true. But it was a very good movie. It was done real well too. I mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like no this can't happen. It seemed re- it seemed real. You know it was really good. Yeah. That that was one I mean. It's not my all time favorite movie. But it was good. It was really good. <SEP> Yeah. And um I don't know if you like this kind. But I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie too. Oh yeah. That was a great movie. Yeah. I've we've seen that two or three times. We waited. And we rented it. <SEP> Yeah. You know but but it was really good. Uh have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY? No. I haven't. I don't know if I've even heard of that one. <SEP> Ye- ye- yeah. It's got. It must have uh what's his name in it. No. No. It doesn't. <SEP> No. Really. Uh Hogan? Yeah. Paul Hogan. <SEP> No. No. Really. I'm surprised. No. It's got uh uh Cheech Marin. Oh really that must be pretty good then. Was it good. <SEP> Yeah. It is. It's kind of uh kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse. Oh. But it was kind of cute. Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS? Yes. Yes. <SEP> I though that was a really cute movie. I enjoyed that. Yeah. It was. TWINS was good too. Because when I thought of that I thought of. Anyway. Um oh there was another one. What's the one that just. Oh DANCES WITH WOLVES have you seen that yet? No. I haven't. Oh you've got to see that one. It's really. <SEP> I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video. Right. That's probably true. That's probably true. It's it's very very good. Very good. Yeah. That's another one that. I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it. <SEP> Well my wife uh has got a uh a picture from Kevin Costner. And he signed it. It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES. Really. Yeah. And he signed it. He he happens to be uh a friend of one of her her business associates. And or not not a friend a cousin a cousin. Oh wow that's impressive. <SEP> Oh neat. So uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture. And it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES. So we've got to uh try to get out there and see that one. Oh yeah. It's really worth it. I mean it's a very good movie. And yes. I would suggest seeing it at the theater. I know that they're still playing it. And they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until like August. <SEP> Huh. I think because they were they were scheduling a video release of it in July. And then when it won all those awards uh they pushed it back to August. So. But yeah. That one is definitely worth seeing. It's really good. Now did you see uh DRIVING MISS DAISY? Yeah. And you know I didn't think that one was near as good. <SEP> Okay. You know I guess it was okay. I mean it was all right. But um when I compare like the winners of this year and last year it just. I don't know. Maybe it's it's not.
