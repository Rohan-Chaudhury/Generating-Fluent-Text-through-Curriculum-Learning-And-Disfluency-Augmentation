Well do you own a P C? No. I don't. I have one at uh. The company I work for furnishes. So I can work at home. Oh wow. <SEP> And it's just an old old compact that is super slow. And but it does it does its job. So. What processor does it have in it? Um I don't know. It's so old. It's one of. Oh what kind of work do you do on it? <SEP> Um I do um television ratings. And I process some ratings and put do graphics for their television stations their clients. Oh okay. So. Yeah. <SEP> It's basically just data entry and running you know some some software. So it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated you know. Huh yeah. I don't own a P C. But I've I've yeah I work for T I. And uh. Yeah. My husband does too. So. Well I have uh pretty fa- a fairly fancy one. It's a T I model. It's an S P one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty-six. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I. The the job that I do. I do a lot of training of our customers for new products. Uh-huh. And I have to develop uh functional specs and disk and desk top publishing and everything. So it's it's kind of fun. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I mean I I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house. But I just haven't got around to doing it yet. <SEP> Oh yeah. I'd like to have one for the house too. But sometimes my husband my husband says usually I work on the computer all day at work. I don't want to come home and have to work on one too. Your husband what what group is your husband in? Um something with the defense. Oh? <SEP> Huh? Defense systems and electronics group? Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. They've changed their name so many times I've lost track. So. I see. Yeah. <SEP> He works up in Plano. Oh okay. So. Yeah. I work on uh printers and the peripheral products division basically uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I work in the airline ma- marketing group. Oh. So we we do a lot of. <SEP> I didn't even know they had anything like that. Oh yeah. Man. There's so. They're. I learned so many things that they they do. They're into so many different things. So. <SEP> Yeah. I just kind of. In for a while you know. He had a he had uh one of those what are they top secret things you know where he couldn't talk about what he did so. For a while. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> But then he switched jobs. I don't understand half the stuff he does. And I have uh. Is he a programmer? Uh-huh. I see. <SEP> Software design engineer so as they call it. So. But I have a degree in information management which is computer you know. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> It's basically the more the bus- business end of it than the programming end of it you know. Right. So but I've been at it for you know five years. So. Everything's changed so much I probably couldn't even get a job right now. It seems like it's changed so much. So you know they've made such advances in computers. So. Really. So uh does your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook? Does he bring a little one home with him. Or. <SEP> No. Huh-uh. Sometimes he bri- he brought home a uh a portable one. Uh-huh. But uh it it quit working. So he brought it brought it back. And he just hasn't brought another one home. But they did give him a new computer at work. So. Oh I see. Yeah. We we build uh laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. And those are really handy. I mean we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your P C. Oh how nice. But they're they're really. <SEP> No. He doesn't have one of those. So. What's that? He doesn't have one of those. Yeah. They're they're pretty handy because you know when I travel it's easy to check messages. Just you know plug in the phone to your computer and dial in. <SEP> Uh-huh. And. Yeah. Well my husband doesn't have to travel. So. Oh okay. Yeah. I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again. <SEP> Oh boy. Well at least you get to. So that kind of reeks havoc with plans. But it it's really not enough to become a big hassle. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well that's good. Some people enjoy the travel. But I don't think I'd like it if he traveled a lot. I see. Yeah. I would love to have a computer. They. But they're so expensive. Well I don't know. There you can get well. Depends on what you consider expensive. I mean. <SEP> Uh-huh. You can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars. Yeah. You know. I guess it's not it's all you know it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be. But it's a lot to put into one. Yeah. It's still I mean. You know two thousand dollars isn't just just pocket change to a lot of people. <SEP> That's right. No. It's not. It's it's not pocket change. So it's major. Maybe when the kids get in school that will be you know. When they start needing something you know then that will be different. But. Yeah. When I started at uh T I I was a Summer development student and finishing up at school. Uh-huh. And so those papers really. I mean it was nice having access to the equipment to uh. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yes. I remember that. I had to do some of my husband's papers because I had access to one. But you know he his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing you know. So. Yeah. <SEP> I did a lot of his papers. Yeah. They come in real handy. That was a lifesaver. Well how many different types of packages do you use? At home? Uh-huh. <SEP> Um all I. The packages I I don't really use. I what I use that outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that I use. Oh okay. Yeah. Golly. I've got. Up up at work anyway I use WordPerfect and Lotus and and which is uh uh a a line-draw package. Yeah. I know those two. <SEP> Uh-huh. I've just used WordPerfect and Lotus and the most. Yeah. You probably use or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that you're talking about. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. A lot of the data entry stuff they used uh survey system and and um you know just in-house programs to do what they needed. I work. Do you get do you work at home all the time. Or just. <SEP> Well no. I worked for this company before I had my first daughter. Uh-huh. And they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things. So. Oh that that was that worked out pretty good then. <SEP> Yeah. It did. You know I don't do I don't really don't do basic a lot of what I used to do. I just do you know something really minor. But it's something that nobody else wants to do. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> And it's time consuming. So. So it keeps you in the company huh? That's right you know. It gives me a paycheck you know. It's only like the work's only you know three weeks. Goes for like three to four weeks three times a year. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know it's not something that's continual because you know the television ratings don't come out you know all the time. They only come out four times a year. So but. Yeah. Boy. I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here I'd get all kinds of stuff done. Oh. Phone's always ringing. And people always asking me to do something else. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I've got a lot of. Especially right now we've got several new products coming out. And I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise. <SEP> Uh-huh. Will they let you take a computer home to work? Well yeah. But you know I need to be at the office too. Oh uh-huh. You know I've just got to deal with all those other things that happen. But a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I bet. Yeah. My hu- he took one home when they when they had it you know they had a big deadline coming up. And it was looking a little touchy to meet. So. Uh-huh. Well I've I've done that before on a couple times. <SEP> Yeah. But that would make it just that much easier. Instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks you know. Uh-huh. That's right. I thought that would be you know. Because it's real nice with this because I don't even have to go into the office. I've maybe been into the office once in the past three years you know. Oh my. <SEP> They just um they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever. So you know. Man that sounds really nice. Yeah. It is real nice you know. I just deal with them on the telephone. Half the people don't even know who they're talking to. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I you know worked. I know most of them well. I can't say that. A lot of people changed around there. But most people know who I am. But I don't know who they are you know. Uh-huh. A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice. Right. Yeah. I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as well. <SEP> Yeah. You just know them by the telephone. So. But well it's been good talking to you. I think we've got the subject. Yeah. We sort of stayed to the topic anyway. Yeah. We tried. It's hard to sometimes. Okay. Well we'll talk to you later. <SEP> Okay well thanks. Bye bye. Bye.
