What are you guys having for Christmas? What are we having? Let's see. Well I'm not planning the menu. Oh you're not. <SEP> No. We usually go out to ei- either one of our folks. They both live close to. Yeah. But um I don't know. It seems like a a big thing for Christmas is usually ham. Well funny you should mention that. I'm a pig farmer. <SEP> Oh you are. Yeah. Huh. Well now it's kind of a hobby more than anything else. But we're going to have uh wild boar. <SEP> My goodness. We uh we killed a boar the other day. It was you know mating with the sows. And you can't use the piglets you know. So. Huh. It's about six months of no use. So we uh we shot him and cleaned him out and had him you know processed into ham. And uh we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because I I've got one that's got a a hernia. <SEP> Oh really. And rather than you know pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him. Is that is that hard? Well no. Hey I tell you what preparing a little pig is is a snap. <SEP> I'm telling you real easy easier than chicken. Oh really. Yeah. You just uh. You kill him you know. You probably. Most guys just shoot them in the head. They go you know. In a second they're gone. <SEP> Oh. And then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water pull it out and there's a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what I usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him. Huh. <SEP> Oh my goodness. And after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there. And it's the best eating you ever had. Oh well does a boar taste just like regular ham? Yep. Just like a pig. <SEP> Does it. I mean you know uh it has a lot less fat. Huh. This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds. <SEP> Oh my. And he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds. Oh my goodness. Well you know we took the skin and the head and the le- and the feet off. And that was about you know a hundred hundred pounds of just ham. <SEP> Oh well how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas? Oh well we're you know we're not going to eat the whole thing. Eat it all. Yeah. It would take a year. But uh you know we're going to drive up to Kansas City see my wife's folks. And uh she she. What's what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas. Yeah. Well her mom's doing brisket. <SEP> I don't. What is brisket? Brisket? It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away. Huh. It's just tough as a boot. <SEP> Oh. And uh you know they used to use it for leather I think. Oh my goodness. I mean no. I was kidding. <SEP> Yeah. But uh it's it's a part of the loin you know the rib cage. And it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs. So it's really really a tough piece of meat. <SEP> Oh my goodness. But it's so tasty you can't stand it. Huh. So you just take it. And you marinate it for a couple of days. <SEP> And that softens it up huh. Huh. And then uh you just put it in the oven. Takes about four hours to cook one. They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds. <SEP> Oh gee. And uh we're going to have that. Well what else do you serve with your pig? Oh well we'll have cranberries and hominy. And uh we we are we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here. <SEP> Huh. We have oliv- olives black olives and cucumbers and uh tomatoes. We still have tomatoes. Oh do you? Yeah. Fresh tomatoes. <SEP> Oh we we just got lots of snow. Well it started to freeze up around here you know. There's nothing between you and us but our barb wire and half of that's down. I mean it's thirty degrees this morning. Oh really. Yeah. <SEP> Huh. But uh it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost. Oh my goodness. I didn't know it got that low at night. Oh yeah. Well it's desert you know. Where where we are it's it's it's uh the edge of the desert. I mean it's part of the Great Plains. So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred hundred and ten. <SEP> Oh gee. And at night it goes down to about sixty. My goodness. Yeah. We get a fifty de- degree temperature swing in about four hours. <SEP> Oh boy. So everything that lives around here is real tough. Oh. That's trees you know. We got hundred year old trees that are you know twenty feet tall. <SEP> Oh gee. That's all the bigger they get. They you know they're just hard as a rock.
