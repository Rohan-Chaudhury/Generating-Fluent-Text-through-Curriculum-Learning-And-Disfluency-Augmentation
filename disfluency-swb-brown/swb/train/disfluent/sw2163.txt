Okay. Okay. I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute. <SEP> Okay. Well credit cards boy that's an easy topic. Ye- Yes. Isn't it. <SEP> It is. It's one we all hold dear and near I'm sure. Oh yes. Yes. I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them. Yeah. Most of mine's been pretty good although I'm I guess I'm like a lot of other people now. I'm trying to to pay off my credit cards. And and uh I've done pretty good at it. Yeah. Uh-huh. Well I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want. You know not need want. <SEP> Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. There is a big difference. There's a big difference there. Yeah. Yeah. But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline. <SEP> Yeah. Oh yeah. I I do that. I do that. But the rest like I said the rest of them I've been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas. Uh-huh. It's too easy to to run into the gas station. Oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way. <SEP> And. Uh-huh. At least that's for me. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. But yeah. I've I've talked to some who's really had some bad experience. And kind of knock on wood I haven't yet not bad. <SEP> Yeah. Well that's. You know I just I'm just shocked at the end of the month to see what damage I have did. But I try to keep it pretty reasonable. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well I've been pretty lucky in that respect. I don't charge like I say I've I been trying to to not charge except for emergencies. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh so but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards. There's you know. They have uh wonderful features. They're there when you need them. You know like in emergencies or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. And then they have bad drawbacks too. I mean high interest. <SEP> Yeah. It's it's awfully easy. It's like paying twice. That's true. That's true. Yes. So. <SEP> I try to. I did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though. That seems to be a pretty low interest. Yeah compared to some of the other ones. Oh uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> And you don't have an annual fee there. And that helps. Oh yes. Uh we used to have you know like several. But right now we're just more or less at American Express you know. Uh-huh. And that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in. <SEP> Yeah. That's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well I'll just pay on it this month. Yeah. Pay fifteen. Yeah. <SEP> And. Yes. I know. Yeah. Yeah. And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time. <SEP> Takes a long time. That's right. It sure does. And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that's you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Of course it's been going down for a number of years. But this is the last year you can take anything. So. Uh-huh. Yeah. So. Well I've enjoyed talking to you. <SEP> Well I've enjoyed talking to you. And maybe we'll get to talk again. Okay. Okay. Bye-bye. <SEP> Bye-bye.
