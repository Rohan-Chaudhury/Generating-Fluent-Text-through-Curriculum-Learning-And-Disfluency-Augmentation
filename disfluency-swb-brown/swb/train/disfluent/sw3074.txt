Yes um. I I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job. I mean at least their plans have are good. Um how- however I was. Maybe you saw in the paper this morning that um they've had some problems with the recycling on plastic. <SEP> With the plastic. Uh-huh. I thought that was most interesting. Well I just I thought it was sad that they it started out as a good program. But then people started dumping trash. And the wrong objects in there. Yeah. <SEP> Yes. And I and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump. Yeah. <SEP> That's right. And and uh I it's too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing. Yeah. <SEP> I guess that's going to happen. Yeah. <SEP> A really good effort. That's right. Yeah. But uh. Well I was thinking about the other day um when I when Dick and I were oh many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri um I went oh. I was probably this was probably. See it have been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight um. We I went to a meeting. And uh one of the the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling. And um she was from Saint Louis. <SEP> Um. And she had this fantastic um family effort in in recycling. And she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum. Oh. And I thought wow I mean how one person is doing that you know. But my my thought was it's a shame. I mean it's wonderful that she's doing it and it. But wouldn't it be mu- much nicer if we all did it. Because her effort would have really um really uh been a good example for all of us. And yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time. And here we are you know. Now we're doing it on a city wide basis in in communities. <SEP> Doing it. So it's wonderful that we've come that far I think. But Um. What did she do with. If if she. Was she like a group that was doing it. <SEP> Or was she doing it on her own. And what did she do with the. I think she was. I was trying to remember. It seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in Saint Louis. There were places where she could actually take her uh things herself uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so it wasn't you know something that was being picked up. Or um and I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would. But I remember her saying yes I have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing. And I thought wow that's that is wonderful that somebody does that. You you have to really want to do it though. Yeah. <SEP> This is. Even even what you recycle. Because we we do the the plastics and the and the aluminum and the glass and the paper. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Yes. And um and of course then you know you try to buy right too. But Um a lot of our neighbors say well what you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that and you have to. Sure you do. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It's uh we we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans. Uh-huh. Isn't that amazing? <SEP> And I thought what are you complaining about when you're only going to get picked up once a month you know or once a week. Well you know. Yes. <SEP> And. People I don't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort. Rather than work with it. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I don't know. It's it's. I under- I know what you're saying. Kind of people like that. And Well sure it is. Well it's for everybody's benefit. <SEP> I mean it's it's not. So maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime. But we you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren. Yep. And what kind of quality of life are you leaving them? Yeah. It's on down the line. <SEP> Right. And and the and I have a real concern about that. Yes. Yeah. <SEP> Uh. I agree. When. We've never had much trash. Because wh- while. I was raised in a big family. And and Gene's family wasn't big. Uh-huh. <SEP> But they weren't rich. Yeah. And they had to to recycle. Sure. <SEP> And and you know the fu-. Well they didn't. They just used things. They didn't throw things away before they were used up. Yeah. Right. <SEP> And. Yeah. Well I know um. I guess I got a good example from my mother. Because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things. And she is to this day. And you know I mean she'll even. Uh-huh. Um if she. For instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies. It would go on that. Or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she'd use that. <SEP> Yeah. Right. She just she recycles everything. And I have done the same thing. I recycle like zip lock bags and things like that. <SEP> Right. My kids get the biggest kick out of that. Although they do the same thing. I mean they I think they give me a hard time. Right. But I think they know that that's it's the right way. <SEP> They've picked up the hab-. Well they do. And when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things Th- and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yes. And they appreciate how much it costs to do that. Yeah. <SEP> That's right. And pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's not such a bad way. To go. But. That's true yeah. <SEP> Well I don't know you know. I I wonder how how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work. I mean the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually uh making sure that uh you take stuff over to you know. Some people are compl- now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside you know. And I think golly Moses you just do your part. You know people are not. You you you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- work ou- out. <SEP> Right. Well see this this is what concerns me. You. Over in Europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here. No. That's right. You you've got to be in a country. Even in in Mexico you don't see things thrown away like we do here. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> I mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king's ransom to most people. Yes. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I. And even to people in our country who scavenge for food. Yeah. And and and I I think you have to get into a period of need bef-. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. You can't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. No. <SEP> This is uh I this is why I thought Jimmy Carter was never very po- very pos-. Uh. Uh-huh. You know people didn't like him. <SEP> Because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that. Yeah. Yeah. Right. <SEP> Do those little things. Yeah. And and uh the pe- I nobody wanted to hear it. That make a lot of difference. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It's I you know. And I think you're right though. It's. I think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or you have to grow up with it being im- important in your life um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes. Uh-huh. And um I don't know. It's uh it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am than I even myself than I used to be a few years ago. <SEP> Right. I mean like I I'd go to the um to the U T D um cafeteria for lunch sometimes. Uh-huh. And they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't need to use styrofoam plates. <SEP> Um. Right. You know and I think to myself that's that's crazy. I wonder if you know maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And and uh I'm seeing more and more of that. And and I think it's uh just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff. Right. I think is a good good example you know that even industry is willing to do it. <SEP> Huh. I I think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled. Yeah. <SEP> Well I think that may that's kind of what it's coming to I'm sure. That's that's right. And and uh do we have to wait until all the landfills are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage. Yeah. <SEP> Oh yeah. That's right. Yeah. <SEP> Or and I don't. With the mind set of the American public I think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash. That isn't that isn't harmful. Uh-huh. Wow. That doesn't wouldn't surprise me. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I know it. <SEP> That's the way we solve problems. And unfortunately. And it's sad.
