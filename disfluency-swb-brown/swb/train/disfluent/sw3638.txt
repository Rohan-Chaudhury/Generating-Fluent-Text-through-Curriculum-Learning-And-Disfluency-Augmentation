Uh well uh the Cowboys are my favorite team. That's pretty easy to say nowadays. Lot easier than it was a couple years ago. But they had a big win today. Uh did you get to watch it? <SEP> No. I didn't. I uh have been at my computer all day. So. Oh. Are you a Cowboy fan? Well I used to be a real big Cowboy fan. And and uh I'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan. <SEP> Being an Okie I just really don't care much uh. Right. Yeah. It's it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan though. Uh-huh. <SEP> They've always been you know my favorite. Right. But uh and and I guess I still have a soft spot. Yeah. <SEP> I just hate that that's the coach that's leading them. Right. Right. <SEP> So now have they. They're in the playoffs right? Yeah. They made it to the playoffs finally. Like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen. They won like just one game. And so pretty fast turnaround. But this year they made it to playoffs. And today was the first game. And they beat the Chicago Bears. So everybody's really going crazy you know down here. I'll bet they are. They're going crazy. So so they turned it around. But you know they have a lot of young exciting players now uh. I mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired Tom Landry. But you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that. <SEP> Uh football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world. Uh-huh. Hit a bad season. And it's you know the coach's fault. Let's let's dump him. Right. <SEP> First good season the coach can do no wrong. Right. Exactly. You know. But they Dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and both running running backs and and defense. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Yeah. Uh you know they have a young team. It's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old you know players every year and you know same coach same everything. So now it's you know like a taste of something different. They're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be. <SEP> Now it's like you know tough and dirty team. So everybody is really excited. And. Who is the competition going to be? Well it's supposed to be the Redskins but you know we beat them already. We beat them this year in in Washington. So you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl. But you know it's just that we have to play every game away you know. It's going to be tough. But but every-. The competition is are teams that they've already beat this year. So I mean Atlanta they're in it too. And we beat them. And uh see Detroit we play them next week. But you know we should beat them. Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them. So it's so everything's uh looking real good. <SEP> Course I think you know you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> And you know it can be a tot- or injuries that uh have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played. Right. Right. <SEP> Yeah. Well the Cowboys are on a roll. They've won like I think six or seven in a row now. So they're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the playoffs. So. But but since you have an O U drop out as a quarterback. Right. Yeah. Troy Aikman. He got hurt at O U. So he transferred to U C L A. <SEP> Well Well he he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U. Right. <SEP> O U has always been known for their running game. Uh-huh. More than. They're playing tonight in fact. <SEP> Right. I'm watching them on T V right now. But they're doing some stomping on Virginia. Oh I tell you. They've they've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts. Really? Well they're doing good tonight. <SEP> Are they? Yeah. I haven't been watching. They're winning. They're winning forty-one to seven. <SEP> Well good for us. Yeah. <SEP> Right. Oh. But yeah. And uh that's right. Aikman did go to O U. I forgot about that. <SEP> Yeah. They h-. Then he went out to S to southern Cal. Is that where he went? Yeah. Uh U C L A. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> So. But the Cowboys did good today. I mean I was proud. I thought I thought they would get beat today because I mean they're so young you know. Playoffs.
