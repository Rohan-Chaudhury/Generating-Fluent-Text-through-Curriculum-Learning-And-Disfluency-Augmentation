All right. So uh you live in Dallas? Yes. I live in Dallas. Now I understand that um the the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down. <SEP> Yeah. I think right now it's it's kind of bad. Uh. I don't live in a house. I live in an apartment. Oh. Are are you in a house? Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Okay. Yeah. We have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington. Uh-huh. Well I guess the best I can do is is uh compare apartments. <SEP> If it can compare the one that I have now with the one that I had the last time the one that I have now uh has a lot more amenities I guess is the right word than the one that I moved out of. Uh this one you know gave us free cable and uh ceiling fans. And uh it was practically new when I moved in here. And the carpet was new. And. Huh. Do you live in the high-rise? <SEP> No. It's not a high-rise. It's just a a two story building. Uh-huh. Uh but there's you know there there are a lot of buildings. But it's just two stories. Uh on the second floor they have they don't have a patio. But they have a sunroom instead of the patio. On the first floor um where I am there's a patio. Oh okay. So so you just you have one floor all to yourself? <SEP> Yeah. Oh okay. The rooms are nice and large. And let's see I have I have two bedrooms. And uh. Oh that's nice. Do you get your own washer dryer? <SEP> Well I I I have a washer and dryer area. And I I did buy the washer and dryer. But they didn't provide it. Oh. The one that I moved from didn't didn't have a place to put them. And that's one of the reasons that I did move. Yeah. That is nice. <SEP> Yeah. Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat. Yeah. <SEP> So tell me ab-. Yeah. I've always uh been pretty lucky. The real estate out here's been pretty good. It uh the the prices of well the prices came down last year. We've we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome. Yeah. The past uh uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia. <SEP> Uh-huh. It just It's a real good. It just never happened before. So it's really surprising everybody. All the developers don't know what to do. <SEP> Yeah. It's a good time to buy if you're in the market. Yeah. Unfortunate-. We're uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we have a three bedroom house. And it's pretty much filled up right now. Oh so you want a bigger one. Yeah. Uh-huh. Get an extra bedroom or a basement. Right now it's just a a single level rambler. <SEP> Uh-huh. One thing about the houses in uh in Dallas they don't uh utilize basements the way they did in New York. My parents in New York had uh a uh three family house. Uh-huh. <SEP> Actual a. Two family house where the the um the downstairs and the second floor they had. And then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment you know. Oh. <SEP> And uh they had a basement. And they you know they finished the basement. And they were able to rent that out also. But uh in Dallas I I just I just haven't seen basements in houses. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> And I've looked at a lot of them you know. Yeah. A friend of mine was thinking about coming down there. And that's what he said was that you know it just wasn't something that people had down there. No. It's a-. They put pools and garages on but uh no basements. <SEP> Right. I haven't I haven't I have yet to see a basement in a house. Huh. <SEP> And uh. Maybe it's all the sand. Is there a lot of sand in. I always think it's like a desert. I don't know. Dallas always. Well no. No. No. No. You know I don't see that kind of sand here. Um. There are some areas though where where they have a problem with uh the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the to the uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Or the foundation is sinking or something. You know just a little just a little bit some more than others. But you you have to know the right spot to to pick where that doesn't happen. Yeah. <SEP> And uh. Well out here we um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a natural you know natural grasslands. Uh-huh. And uh they. It's just you go down four inches. And you get to sands- well fourteen inches you get to sandstone. <SEP> Yeah. And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast. I see. It's just solid sandstone. <SEP> Huh. Where did you say you're at Colorado? No. Virginia. Virginia. Virginia. That's right. Yeah. It's sort of unusual really. Most of Virginia is clay. <SEP> Anywhere near uh Virginia Beach? Oh yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. My uh my folks used to live there. Back before I was born they lived there. Oh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well different areas in Dallas have different kind. In uh in Texas I'll say. Because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay. Uh-huh. And uh in the in the Dallas you know Fort Worth city areas you don't see that. Yeah. Well uh Texas is a big state. So I imagine the the type of houses and uh things like that are truly different from area to area. <SEP> Yeah. Well. But uh that's the same way out here. Because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington. Uh-huh. And anything instead that beltway the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive. <SEP> Yeah. So you know you really can't afford I I I could never afford a house inside the beltway. That's why we came out here. This is called the the the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from D C twenty-five from the city. Huh. But um it's considered the country since it's uh you know that far out. <SEP> Well. But um yeah. We live out by Dulles Airport. I see. Yeah. And uh that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia. They have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here. And you know it's it's still pretty rural. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore. Land has gotten so expensive. They just can't afford to have low income housing like that. So is your house in an area by itself? I mean. No. We're in a development. <SEP> It's not connected to another one? There's uh. Yeah. There's another one half an acre away or a quarter acre away rather. Oh. <SEP> But it's not they're not connected are they? Oh no. Huh-uh. You have to uh stay in one single family home. I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up. Yeah. Uh my folks um had an apartment for a while when we were kids. But um for the most part i- they they always had you know. And Pennsylvania always had a single family home. And so you know as soon as we could we we got a single family home. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that's all I ever knew growing up. Uh-huh. So. I stayed in a townhouse for uh two years and then uh saved up enough money to to get a.
