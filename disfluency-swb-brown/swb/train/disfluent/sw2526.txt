Okay. What kind of car are you thinking about buying next? Well what a wh- what do we currently have. I have a Subaru uh G O X T. What year? <SEP> Eighty-eight. Oh okay. Well I have a ninety Honda Civic. And I'm ready to get rid of it. Actually. Oh it's not pretty old. No. Uh well I ha- I had an eighty-eight that I really liked. And it got wrecked. And so I bought a ninety um because I I really liked my eighty-eight. And I've had a lot of problems with this one. So. <SEP> So you think their quality control's going down over there kind of? Well you. It's it's kind of funny um. I know a lot. Well I I I think we're going to see that I think uh that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit while American carmakers are trying to get their put together. Oh. <SEP> Yeah. So. It's it's true. It's definitely true because. <SEP> But but that's one reason. I uh I've had no problems with my Subaru. That's one reason I went with it because I Subaru had a good reputation uh for you know low maintenance. So. Yeah. Well Honda does too that's why I was really. Well really. There's there's no question. But you have a nineteen. I mean I've got to see if. I mean I've seen and I've had friends that have uh like uh eighty-one or eighty uh Celicas. Uh-huh. <SEP> And those things just keep ticking. Yeah. I mean they just they can rack up a a hundred fifty K on them. That's true. <SEP> And they're still beating on them. That's true. And it's just amazing. And then they got. And you know they're not making them like that now d- d- you know. No. <SEP> So. Not at all. But they're still they're still a lot I think definitely better than the American carmaker system. Oh I I definitely agree with you there because I had uh uh uh Ford T Bird before I got my Honda. And it was the worst car I've ever owned. <SEP> Yeah. And um that's why I mean I was so tickled with my Honda. It was just a wonderful car. And then it got wrecked. And you know I wouldn't even look at another car. Yeah. I just went and bought a Honda I mean I didn't even I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want. And I really have had a lot of problems with it. But I don't know. <SEP> Well maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-. Well I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty. But in the first twelve months that I owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month. It was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. It was. I was really disappointed because I was you know so hyped up on Honda. So. <SEP> Oh well. Yeah. Anyway. So what's your next purchase supposed to be? Well I know this. <SEP> Oh really. If you had a choice of your car what would you get? Well it's this is going to sound really strange. But I really like to have a Mazda M P V van. I really like those. And I have kids. So. I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that. They're a lot. I don't like the new style like of the Toyota van and the the new Chevy Lumina van. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I don't like those styles um the M P V is more of uh uh just uh I don't know what you normal. I don't know how to explain more of an old fashioned type. I I'm not sure how to explain it. <SEP> Yeah. I mean it looks I guess kind of like uh the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow. Yeah. No. What. Astro Astro I guess is what it something like that. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. But I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think. Do you have uh do you have a family? Yeah. I have a couple kids. <SEP> Okay. Well that's probably influenced maybe a little bit. Oh yeah. Definitely. But I know that it's got to have a radio it's got to have air conditioning. I'm sure you can uh relate to air conditioning. Um living in Arizona. Oh yeah. But and cruise control and tinted windows that's about it. I mean it's got to have those things otherwise I don't care. <SEP> Yeah. Well when I bought my car it was right out of college. And uh you know I always been looking for something sporty. And I ended up getting you know basically something that I could you know afford. Uh-huh. The only gripe I have is performance. I probably uh. A few girls that I've gone out with I've had uh like Mazda R X sevens and stuff. And they're they're pretty fun to drive. So so I think that's what uh I I'm going to have to get next time around I keep I keep hold- holding off. Yeah. <SEP> Oh really? And then I could I could upgrade now if I wanted to. But I just I. It's just such a huge expense. And and uh I I'm just going to keep holding off. But I'm definitely going to look for something uh in the you know nice perpor- you know. Sports car. <SEP> I'd like to have a sports car too. But it's not practical for me. But. Yeah. I'm in. Are you still there? Yeah. Whoops. There's some kind of problems. Hello. <SEP> Hello. Are you still there? Okay. This is. Something's wrong. <SEP> Wonder what happened. I don't know. It sounds funny though doesn't it? Huh. Anyway um but I'll probably um. Huh. <SEP> It just depends. I know that's what I want. But I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money. You're looking at you know for a new R X seven or a Supra or something. You're looking at twenty-five K or something that like. Oh at least. Yeah. And so anyway but Anyway my ultimate car though the the one that I really want is uh five sixty or so Mercedes. I know well new cars aren't cheap anyway. <SEP> But. So. Huh. <SEP> Maybe someday. Yeah. We have we all have those kind of dreams too don't we? Yeah. What I'd really like to have. <SEP> That's the only one that I you know. I se- you know I see uh you know early on that that that says it says you there? Yeah. This is strange. Hello. Hello. I think something's wrong with this. <SEP> Okay. I hope it's recording. I hope it's not my. You there? Yeah. <SEP> It may be my phone um. Anyway it's the only car that says you know sporty and class uh. So. Yeah. You're right. Yeah. Uh kind of what I'm. But it's. At the other one my brother's got a Miata. And those are fun. Oh those are nice. <SEP> And uh i-. Yeah. They're they're cute cars. Yeah. Well he did he had a a red Miata. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh he actually. They came out with a European racing green uh Miata that's a limited edition. Oh. They're only going to make like three or four thousand. So he went out. And he traded the other one in and got this one. Wow I haven't seen those. <SEP> And I'm like um but uh I haven't seen one yet either. But supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel. Wow. So it's it's very authentic. And there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be may be a good investment. If it. Oh yeah. Definitely. <SEP> Yeah. If it's a limited edition usually no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on. Uh-huh. But uh I think. Hello. Yeah. <SEP> Okay. Yeah. I got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway uh hope it's not going bad. Oh. It's going to bump me out. Um but he I think he he only spent you know the low twentys. So I don't know. Really? <SEP> Now see I would have never figured that I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition. Well I don't know. I think the demand's gone all down a little bit. I think you can. The prices aren't as high you know. And the the mu- Miata was first introduced uh. And well they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they? <SEP> Wh-. Yeah. The demand is so high that uh you know they were going to retail them around like thir- you know thirteen standard you know. And you get your options you're looking at fifteen or si- fifteen. Yeah. That's true. <SEP> But there were you know people were buying them for nineteen and twenty. Uh-huh. And um they they may have gone down a little bit. Huh. <SEP> But I. They're still pretty much in demand. I think there's another car coming in. It's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata. Huh. And I can't remember what I read about that. But so that's. I mean I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular. So. Yeah. It really is. <SEP> But. Have you seen the new uh Dodge Stealth? The the real nice one. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And the Mitsubishi three thousand G T is the same same. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. The Mitsubishi is real nice looking too. Yeah. Well that's that's that's the same manufacturer. Now those are nice. <SEP> And st- so they just market them. Right. Right. <SEP> But uh yeah. Those are and those are supposed to be very performance power I mean they're there is yeah big time. The expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand. But those are pretty stripped. And there's nothing. There's really. That one's just more for looks you know. It doesn't have any really the performance that the expensive one does. <SEP> Yeah. You know but I've seen one of those. And it's not that great I mean because they really. I think the- they're only around uh twenty-nine K. Yeah. The-. Like I mean they have um better. It's not quite as nice for a little bit less. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. They're not really that bad. But I don't know. Like I said it's it's still not practical for me. I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think now there's no way I can do that. Yeah. I'm being single. And no other responsibilities for yourself I guess you know it's I can I can I've been pretty happy. Right. <SEP> I've I've haven't tried to upgrade myself right now. That's uh you know I could I could have you know get something nice and upgrade. But I just uh I'm consulting right now. So. Oh really? I just made my first job hop about eight months ago. So. Uh.
