Okay. We're supposed to talk about vacations. Right. So uh well uh what kind of vacations do you like? Well uh I haven't been to many places. But I have a opportunity to go to uh Paris France uh with uh with my friend in April. She is her uh her family you know lives there. And she's only been there once. Her grandmother lives there. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I'm hoping to g- I'm praying I get to go. Uh. Oh that's great. Yeah. It's it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go. <SEP> Uh-huh. Have you ever been to uh like New Mexico? Uh no actually. Oh. <SEP> Why have you? I was curious. I was just wondering what it was like. Oh okay. No uh. I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and uh. Tahiti? <SEP> Yeah. Tahiti. Oh. No. No. Haiti. Oh Haiti. <SEP> Right. Where is that? It's uh well it's in the Caribbean. And it's the western half of an island. With the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries. And study the language and then do a little service project. Uh-huh. Um. <SEP> So yeah. That turned out to be a really good experience for me. So what did you do when you were in Europe? Uh well see I went there when I was in high school actually. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and uh hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp. What did you do on the farm? Uh uh uh well not that much. Just uh. Are you just kind of sight just kind of uh. <SEP> Right. I mean I wasn't a great asset to them or anything. But I you know drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing. Um. <SEP> And uh yep. And I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home. And that was pretty interesting. And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were uh staying for their vacation in France in Nantes which is on the west coast like right across from England. Um. Uh so uh where in France are you. Paris. <SEP> Right. Paris. Yeah. And uh um how long do you plan to be going for? Uh two weeks. Last time she stayed two months. But we're only going to stay two weeks. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. Great. And uh. We're going to take a cooking class there. So that might be fun. <SEP> A what? Cooking class you know. French cooking. Oh great. Yeah. <SEP> And uh what else are you planning to do if anything? Museums you know. Go to museums and. Uh-huh. Yeah um. Do you go to museums in Europe? <SEP> Uh actually no. I don't think I went to any of them. Uh the closest thing I did was go to some like uh restored castles and stuff. Um. That there is some on that west coast of France. And I went to a vineyard or two in Germany. Um that's neat. <SEP> Yeah. That was nice. Uh um but so uh. Hey. What about. Have you ever been to Hawaii? Uh no. I haven't. No? <SEP> Have you?
