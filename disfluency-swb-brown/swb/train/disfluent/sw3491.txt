Well let me see. What have you seen lately? Well uh CITY SLICKERS and STAR TREK FIVE. FIVE? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Y-. Only only five? Yeah. <SEP> I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six. Well no. Didn't need to. No. I found that out. <SEP> How about yourself? I just saw the latest one. How is it? It was fantastic. <SEP> Oh I can't wait. Yeah. It's. The lines in there were just perfect. I mean it was classic TREK. Now does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys? No. Huh-uh. <SEP> No. It's just the old guys still. Yeah. It was just a rumor that that would happen this time. However the rumor is is that it will happen next happen next time. So. You know that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere no it was U S A TODAY. Uh-huh. <SEP> That they said they weren't going to do anymore. That was it. Uh-huh. But. Yeah. Uh except that the rumor is is that they still might. But it may not include the entire crew. And it will be a next generation meets this generation. <SEP> Huh. So. I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the the old guys was. I think it's a hundred years. <SEP> Huh. Somewhere in that range. Considering that Spock was on an uh you know couple weeks ago and that the the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION they had McCoy. Oh that's right. <SEP> Is that right? He was a doctor still? And. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Well you know he was rear admiral whatever you know. And he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow. Vulcans age a lot better. Well yeah. He didn't look too bad did he? No. Huh-uh. Matter of fact he looks just as about as old and the uh NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK. Imagine that. <SEP> Yeah. That's amazing. But did they have some pretty good special effects? Oh excellent excellent special effects. But I think the script was you know just incredible compared to the last one. <SEP> Yeah. FIVE was the script was bad bad bad. Well you know why? No. I don't. Why? Uh William Shatner wrote it. <SEP> Oh is that right? And even worse he directed it. Uh. <SEP> L- Leonard s- Nimoy he does a lot better. Oh yeah. He in fact uh he didn't direct this one. He produced this one. But he directed the one before uh I think STAR TREK FOUR something like that. IN SEARCH OF SPOCK or no JOURNEY HOME I think that was. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Are you're a real life Trekkie? L-. I think so. I really like them. I I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie. But. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh. Well I've gone to you know one for real live Trek Convention. But. Oh really? Yeah. I saw James Doohan you know the guy that plays uh Scotty. <SEP> Huh did you get to talk to him? No. It was crowded. Not in a crowd like that. <SEP> Huh-uh. No. It was like uh want an autograph want to stand in line for about four hours. <SEP> Yeah. Wow. It was a pretty crowded place. <SEP> Huh. They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION. Oh yeah. Yeah. I. It's it's kind of funny. I uh was reading in uh a book. Uh trying to think. I can't quite remember the name of the book. But it was it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style. And they were referring to you know Captain Kirk. Every time he left the Enterprise everything went to hell. Oh. And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship. <SEP> Right. So he kind of was a cowboy type too. Uh-huh. Made all the decisions. But uh Jean Luke does more of a a committee type of management. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh it's definitely a lot better. A lot more realistic really. What other movies have you seen? Uh saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week. <SEP> Oh how was that? It was pretty good. Uh there were a few things different than the old series. But on the on the whole it was pretty similar. And a lot of fun. Lots of little funny spots huh. Oh yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Did they have Thing. And. Oh yes. In fact Thing has a big much bigger role than he does in the series. I mean you know there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day. Really? And he runs around a lot. <SEP> How did. I've always wondered how he gets around. Uh you know just finger hopping. But he's in a box right? No. No. No. In fact it's funny. He never did does come in out of a box I don't think. Yeah. He was just kind of walking around. <SEP> Didn't he used to? Not really. He was always in the box before. Oh. <SEP> Oh that's yeah that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was thinking.
