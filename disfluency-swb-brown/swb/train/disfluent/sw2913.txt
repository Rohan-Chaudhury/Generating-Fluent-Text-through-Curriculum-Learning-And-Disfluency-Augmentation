Okay. Well what movies do you like? Gosh. I like just about anything. We I think the last one we saw was uh TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO. Oh now I lo- I like the turtles. My little boy's four. And he loves them. <SEP> Well we don't have any kids. But we like them anyway. Oh that's okay. How old are you all? Um we're late twenties. Oh and you just don't have any yet. Okay. <SEP> No. Well I've got two. Oh gosh. Yeah. My little girl is three months old. And my little boy just turned four. I had his birthday party yesterday. <SEP> Oh. But he's a turtle fanatic. He even had turtle cake yesterday. But I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO. Is it as good as they say it is? <SEP> It was. It was actually better than the first one I thought. Good. What's the last movie you saw? GHOST. <SEP> Oh. We were just when when the topic came up we I was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw. He said well GHOST and TURTLES. I really liked it. Now GHOST. Yeah. I love tearjerker movies. But that wasn't too bad on tearjerker. But It was oh it was good movie. Not too awful bad. Though I can see why it won so many Oscars. <SEP> Yeah. Because that was just so good. And I like Demi Moore. Did you see PRETTY WOMAN? No. But I've been hearing a lot about it. I don- we don't get to the video store very often. And we don't have cable. <SEP> Oh gosh. Well we don't really want cable. It's just you know glued to the T V all the time anyway. Yeah. So we get two channels down here. I'm from Kentucky originally. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we used to get five channels without cable. Yeah. You know forty. Well I don't think you all have the same channels. But here in Texas we only get two channels. And that's um. Do you watch soap operas? <SEP> Uh once in a while when I'm home. Okay. You work then? Yeah. Okay. Well we get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it. <SEP> Okay. And then uh I think GENERAL HOSPITAL. And that comes on different channel. Yeah. It does. But that's all we get. And that's no cartoons for my little boy. But we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes. <SEP> Yeah. And uh my husband is a movie fanatic. I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN. It was it was really a. It made you feel really good. It was just a happy movie. Oh what about TOTAL RECALL. Have you seen that. <SEP> Yeah. I saw that one. That's good. I I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was. Yeah. It was violent. I try to get away from that. My little boy oh he loves ROBO COP. And that movie I have to I'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is. Have you seen it? <SEP> Yeah. The part where they're shooting mercy. I don't like that. That oh that's horrible. That is horrible. And their their the language on that's filthy. <SEP> I don't see why they have to do that. I mean I mean n- everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and you know use different words instead I think. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I know. But I I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite. I went and bought the video. I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times. Um my husband bought me like um uh I think PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday. With a. Wait a second. I will in a minute Kyle. Sorry. <SEP> That's okay. Uh he bought me PRETTY IN PINK. Just a second. Sorry. Now you're glad you ain't got a four year old. That's okay. Now Now I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK. It this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls. <SEP> That had um does that have Molly Ringwald? Molly Ringwald. Yeah. It was cute. But it wasn't. I like the um SIXTEEN CANDLES or sixteenth birthday or. <SEP> I think I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it. Yeah. Oh that was so good. Of course I was a teenager when I seen that. And I loved it. I haven't seen it either. Oh well if you like love stories it's sweet. <SEP> I do. Oh it's sweet. It really is. And that's a tearjerker. It gets you. I mean it makes you feel really sorry for her. Oh gosh. But it's hilarious too especially with that uh little guy in it. Oh he looks like little I don't know he looks like a little boy next door. <SEP> Oh. But he's sixteen. Oh it's a cute movie. I can't remember his name. He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER. Huh I don't know. Don't know either. <SEP> Bu-. He's got curly blonde hair. He just a little freckly little boy. Probably know him if I saw him. Yeah. If I could remember the name I know you'd know his name because he's played in a few movies. But uh. <SEP> I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was um SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. Okay. I've heard about that. But I can't remember it. That that's that's Julia Roberts' new movie. Okay. Yeah. Julia Roberts is good. <SEP> Yeah. She's. This one. You know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance. Uh-huh. And and this one was a lot more dramatic. Wasn't it a murder mystery? <SEP> Y- well. Like sort of. It was like uh it was a it was a mystery. She disappeared from her hu- uh husband who was abusing her. Oh okay. The yeah that's the one I wanted to see where he was on she was on a carnival at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well did that come on T V. Or did it come out in the. No. It came out in the theater. Oh. <SEP> And I think you know around here it's all ready quit playing. But I don't I don't know if it's still playing any where else. Well I I think. But it was it was it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat. Real good. <SEP> I want to see that. Yeah. I seen the uh previews for it on T V down here. But it's just been down here a couple weeks I think. Oh okay. Yeah. <SEP> Because we saw it probably four or five months ago. A month a-. Well I know it hasn't been that long since I've seen the previews for it. But yeah. I wanted to see it. Her husband was a dark haired guy with a beard and moustache. Or a-. No. He shaved the beard off. <SEP> Yeah. He's uh he was a real psycho in the movie. Yeah. It was it was scary. Oh I'd like to see that. What about oh. There was a. We got one back here a while. I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too. Have you seen that? <SEP> Oh yeah. Boy I I didn't like it. You didn't? No. It was. I didn't like the way it ended. I know. Well the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night Christopher Reeves told that you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. I can't believe they killed them. Or or who was it. Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas. <SEP> Might have been Michael Douglas. Oh that starred in it. Yeah. Yeah. It was Michael Douglas. Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all? <SEP> Huh-uh. Okay. Well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that I can't believe they killed them. And Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas went after his throat you dummy. So I know that they die. But I haven't told my husband. We've both been wanting to see it. <SEP> It was I I it was it was weird. It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen. Well we was uh teasing about you know splitting our house down the middle. Yeah. They did that didn't they. And they marked off routes that they could go or something. <SEP> Yeah. That would be kind of hard for us. We've only got one bathroom. I don't know h-. We've got two bathrooms. But well i- mi-. Actually if he takes. My house kind of looks like two trailers put together. And one bathroom is at the end of one side. And one's in the middle of the other. So we could do it. <SEP> That wouldn't be too bad. No. And he could climb out the window. Wh-. And we our whole house has you know. Every room leads to three rooms. So we can you know. <SEP> Get around. Yeah. You can get around. You just can't go out the front door honey. Sorry. Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION? Yeah. That's coming back on too. <SEP> I know it's going to be on on the on C B S Tuesday night. An and that's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff. Uh-huh. That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was. Huh I. <SEP> Parts of parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny. But then other times it was like it was just deadly serious. And it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know. Eerie feeling. Or I want to see it though. I'd like to see that and uh THE NEVER ENDING STORY came out on Disney this month I think. I I've heard about that. I wanted to see that. <SEP> But I don't know what it's about. THE NEVER ENDING STORY? Yeah. It's a child's movie. But oh it's good. I enjoyed it. <SEP> I love Disney movies. Yeah. I do too. And Yeah. I mean they're some of the best of that are made. Yeah. And uh well it's about this little boy who uh. I think he's up in a attic or some part of school. He got locked in the school. And he got scared. But he starts dreaming. And then uh he's saving the land of uh oh. It's been so long since I've seen it. <SEP> All I know alls I can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing. Oh go-. It flies through the air. And he's trying to save the land from some ooze. <SEP> But it's really good. I mean it sounds ki-. It it had uh Fred Savage in it. No. No. No. No. No. Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it though. I don't think so. With uh oh. He had uh uh. Oh it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE. <SEP> Nope. I didn't see that. You didn't see that. That was cute. That was real that was a good one. I I like I like slapstick comedy. So do I. And a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something. And and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not. So sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than. Yeah. Well I heard. A friend of mine told me she got NAKED GUN last night. And she said that was hilarious. <SEP> Yeah. Now we saw that. And i- and they're coming out with a sequel to it. Two and a half. It was funny. It wa-. Yeah. I want to see that. She said she rented it last night. And said it was real good. An. <SEP> And and WORKING GIRL is really good. Now I seen that. That was good. Was that with that blonde. She pretended to be the boss or something. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I rented that one night by myself. I was home alone. Did you see HOME ALONE? Yes. I did.
