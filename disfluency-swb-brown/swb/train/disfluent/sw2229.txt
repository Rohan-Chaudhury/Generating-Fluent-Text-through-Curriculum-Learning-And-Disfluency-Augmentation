Do yo- are you on a reg- regular exercise program right now? Yes. And I hate it. <SEP> How about you? Oh well I'm kind of off and on. Off and on. Well I guess I've been kind of off and on. I've uh Had some health problems that have led me to uh. Right now I'm kind of off. <SEP> I'd say more on than off. Okay. What type of exercise do you do? Uh I do walking on the treadmill. And then I do low impact aerobics. Okay. I guess you don't enjoy that very much. <SEP> Not not really. Do you find that uh to be boring? Yeah. And time consuming. I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming. It's uh you know afterwards you know. Then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know. Yeah. <SEP> Well I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring. Oh yeah. But I. <SEP> Do you go through this is this something that you go through every year. Yeah. I haven't decided whether whether I want to play yet or not. I just bought myself a solo flex machine. I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V. Uh-huh. It's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machines. But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet. So it's collecting dust right now. <SEP> Yeah. A lot of things do that. I had an I had an exercise bike. I used to jog somewhat. I use to have one. And I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it. But I do use my treadmill. Uh-huh. Well that's good. Yeah. My parents have a treadmill. It's. When I go visit them uh I get on that thing every now and then. <SEP> Yeah. It's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse. Uh-huh. I just got the bicycle out today. And it was real nice outside. Had to get out to do something. Yeah. I can't ride a bike. So. I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold. So thought I better better get outside and do something and not waist the day. <SEP> Oh. Yeah. It's too nice. It's been too nice all weekend. But uh yeah. I need to start jog something again. I've always of that to be uh really one of the best forms of exercise. But it's terribly boring. And so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently. <SEP> Have you ever had any injuries from jogging? No. I never have. Well I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries. I usually only go about a mile or two. I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse. Yeah. <SEP> It's it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt. Uh-huh. Suppose to be much better if you find grass uh or or dirt to jog on. <SEP> Yeah. That's not quite so so easy. You have to have the right type of shoes too. That's very important. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I found that true especially from walking on toe and fronts. But. <SEP> Yeah. I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often. My don't get very much use. Well I guess my breakdown about they say about every six months. Uh-huh. I usually enjoy the exercise I do. But uh like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program. So I'll I'll bicycle. I get into that for for a little while and maybe go out uh on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile. But then I'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week. <SEP> But uh that gets old too in a very short order. <SEP> Yeah. I'm I'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh uh change things a little bit. I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis. Yeah. Well don't let it collect dust. At least exercise while dusting it off. Yeah. <SEP> Well. Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can uh start some type of uh regular program. Yeah. That that'll be good. I've always found that uh when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh when I was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise. An uh one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that. Oh. And that was very helpful. We kept charts of our progress and uh consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks. <SEP> Uh-huh. I found that to be uh very helpful. Are you going to do that? Uh I need to. <SEP> I haven't started yet. But uh it's a thought. Well that sounds like something good to do then. Sounds like something I should do. <SEP> Yeah. Nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape. How often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking? <SEP> Well I do. I switch every other day. One day I walk. And one day I do the aerobics. Okay. How far about how far do you go walking? Well I'm trying to get my tolerance now. I just had surgery um less then two months ago. And right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half. Okay. <SEP> But I'm trying to workup to three miles. Well that's good. Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging. Yeah. It. <SEP> It takes it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect. Sure. Yeah. But. Well if you keep up with a consistent pace just to uh keep the heart rating going uh. <SEP> My walkman broke. Yeah. So I'm upset. <SEP> And I just have to turn to stereo up real loud. Yeah. But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is. <SEP> Yeah. It is. And this doesn't you know. My treadmill has an incline. And you know you can get a really good workout on it. Um do you go to an aerobics class. Or do you watch on T V? No. I I just do it on T V. <SEP> Okay. I have a cassette. Which uh shows do you watch on T V? <SEP> Um it's a it's a tap-. I use tapes. Oh okay. Okay. Like a Cathy Smith workout. Or or Richard Simmons. Or Jane Fonda. <SEP> Okay. Sweating to the oldies. Right. I ev- every now and then I'll watch E S P N. I get cable on T V. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they have uh a couple of shows called basic training. And uh what is the other one called. There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N. I don't know if he's still on any more or not. I don- I don't know if I get E S P N or not. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh one you know. I use to watch one watch one on the air. But that was back. BODIES IN MOTION that's that's the name of the one I was thinking of. That's was. Yeah. With Gill. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I watched that cause he was cute. Yeah. He- he- he's not bad. His assistants usually aren't either. <SEP> But uh. They're always in in Hawaii some place. On on the beach. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. But then that was back when uh you know the high impact and. Yeah. Well they they do low I pact stuff now. <SEP> Do they. They're on every day. Are the-. Yeah. They're still they're still he's still doing it then uh. Yeah. Every morning. <SEP> I'll have to tune in. It's on E S P N uh. At what time. I can't remember what time. It's uh you know. I can't remember offhand what time. I'll have to check it check check check it back up. Yeah. <SEP> And but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show at least on. Yeah. Every now and then. Not everybody has a picture perfect body. Uh-huh. Well I found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V. <SEP> I haven't watch any other ones on T V. Just on some of the tapes. They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that. <SEP> Okay. Thanks. I actually taped a few session that they had on there. But uh I haven't done so much as uh watch the tape that I made. Now that's a thought. <SEP> So I'm kind of bad about that myself. Well that's thought. I haven't thought about that. Well they're going to beep us pretty soon. Okay. Well I sure enjoyed to you about exercise and fitness. <SEP> Nice talking to you too. Okay. Thanks. So all right. <SEP> Talk to you later. Good night. Bye. Bye.
