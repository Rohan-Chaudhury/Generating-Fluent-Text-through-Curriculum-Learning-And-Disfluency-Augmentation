So how many um credit cards do you have? Um I think I'm down to one. Oh my gosh. I wish I was that way. Is that why you said I had more experience than you? <SEP> Well no. I was pulling your leg. Oh. Well how how do you use your credit card? I mean do you just keep it in reserve. Or. I I well. The way I'd like to try and use it is um you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time. Uh-huh. <SEP> And then you pay that off and don't use it until uh it's paid off. Uh-huh. That's that's my ideal way. Uh-huh. How how do you use it? <SEP> Emergencies come along. And I and I use it. Yeah. That's understandable exactly. <SEP> Uh like uh my car uh had a major problem and seven hundred dollars. Uh-huh. And uh things just come up. Right. Right. <SEP> And you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have. Um and I use them you know. Like my American Express I use for you know gas things like that. And I pay that off monthly. And then um some other credit cards like store credit cards you know I do have them up there a little bit. But uh. Uh-huh. I try not to use them too often. But living in this area uh like I live fifteen miles west of Washington D C. <SEP> Um. It's a very expensive area. Yeah. So sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something. <SEP> Yeah. Well I I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards. And I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble. Right. So we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it. Uh-huh. <SEP> I just. Uh-huh. Well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Now are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card. Or? Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there. Uh-huh. Um. Uh-huh. <SEP> Our our only credit card is Sears. So and I have that for automotive purposes. Uh-huh um. Right. Right. Well well that's great. Um everyone I know here uses um credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It's it's just too easy basically uh just get yourself in trouble with those. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The only other one I have. I have like a Diner's Club through my um where I work. <SEP> I see. So that I use because I travel some. So I use that. And I don't really have to worry about that because I only use it for business. So I automatically have the money to pay it off. Yeah. But. Um. <SEP> Uh I wouldn't mind uh you know getting back into one if they would you know. You start out at a low limit. And then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit. Uh-huh. And and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that then that's fine. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But they eventually gets up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Forget it. I don't want that. Um the temptation's too great. <SEP> Yeah. Um. So I don't know. Just uh. Writing checks is just as easy I guess. Yeah. That's true. That's true. But. So I guess uh we've kind of exhausted this uh topic. <SEP> Yeah. Well really. What what can you. Yeah. You can't say too much about it really. Other than you use them or you don't use them. You like them. Or you don't like them. So. Uh-huh. <SEP> I guess uh they don't care if we end it early. So uh hopefully uh you have a good Thanksgiving. That's coming up. And. And then uh maybe we'll talk again. Okay. You too. Yeah. May be. You're the furthest person actually that I've talked. I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Texas is the big one. Yeah. So. <SEP> Okay then. Well bye now. O- okay. Bye-bye.
