But uh. Just about any kind of music. And then. <SEP> I even like classical music. Yeah. Uh I'm pretty diversified too. I I don't I don't like acid rock either. I I grew up in a small town. So uh the only we only had one radio station. So it was country music. Yeah. But then uh when I. <SEP> Yeah. I grew up with Hank Snow and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs. Oh really. You're older than I am. But uh I. Did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway? We don't get Channel Two. My uh our cable doesn't. <SEP> Oh. I wish we got that what. But. That is fabulous. Was it? Well we don't get Channel Two. <SEP> We. Yeah. When he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. And uh it was tremendous. Now he he is a uh. Actually I did. I played flute for almost ten years. <SEP> Yeah. And and uh so I I I appreciate his too his his mus-. Yeah. He he he's from Ireland isn't he? <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. And it was uh mostly all Irish tunes. Was i-. Yeah. They had a band with him that uh had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the uh tin whistle and a couple of violins and uh drum. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they they played all the Irish jigs and so forth. It was just fabulous. Yeah. I he he is really good. Yeah. I I I come from a musical background. <SEP> Yeah. So uh uh I've played fl- flute flute and piano. So I I I have a b- big appreciation for music up to a point. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming an- and much of the new stuff that's coming out. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. My husband says I'm getting old. Yeah. I love uh I li- I especially like instrumentals. Do you? <SEP> Yeah. I love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen. Yeah. That's that's nice to do that is. I've got a I've got a I've got a two year old who's now getting. I'm getting well versed in in kiddy music. Yeah. I'm I've never played an instrument in my life. I've always wanted too. Yeah. <SEP> I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something. Yeah. But uh. But I I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music. I was one of the forced ones. <SEP> Oh I could never do that. And. I was never that brave. But uh yeah. <SEP> I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir. Yeah. Oh yeah. I've I've done I've done that at church too. Yeah. I haven't done that in a long time. <SEP> Yeah. So let's see. What els-. Well what kind of music do you not like? Well like I say the acid rock. I just do not ca-. An I don't care for rap music either. Oh go-. That's not music. <SEP> Uh-huh. No. That is not. I don't know what that is. But that's not music. If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it. Well it's it's it's not it's not music. It's just it's just uh uh talking in a beat. It is just it's not exciting at all. <SEP> Yeah. It doesn't it doesn't give you relaxation. Yeah. You can't dance to it. You can't do anything to it. <SEP> Right. But I and I love I like orchestra music too. Like the Boston Pops or or anything. Yeah. D-. <SEP> Yeah. Have you ever been to the to to the Dallas Symphony? <SEP> Uh-huh. Have you? Is i-. Are are they good? Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. They're good. Are they? I I have I have never been. And uh we went and saw uh L- L- LES MISERABLES. <SEP> Oh really? Oh the music in that was fantastic. I I've heard I've heard that that is a really. <SEP> Yeah. I heard that was hard to get tickets to. Yeah. It it uh. I can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets. <SEP> But it was out you know out at the State Fair Music Hall. And uh it was well worth the price. Yeah. Yeah. That was a real. Was it? <SEP> Yeah. I I bet it was. Yeah. I I really bet it was. Is that the only uh musical. Do you go see a lot of musicals? <SEP> Just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one. Yeah. And. That that would be that would be nice. <SEP> I went and saw uh I think it was uh SUGAR BABIES. That was good. That had good music in it. Was it? How how. I can't I don't know what that's about. Uh that was the one with Mickey Rooney. And uh oh what's that real oh not real old my wife she is old too dancer uh. <SEP> I can't think of her name. I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it Helen something. Uh uh uh I think I know who you're ta- oh I know who you're talking about. Real long legs and dark hair. She's got black hair. <SEP> Yeah. Okay. I know who you're talking about. I can't think ever her name either. I can't think of it. Yeah. That wa- that was that was. I remember that being uh here a few years ago. <SEP> Yeah. But uh. Oh oh the last country music. My my parents still uh really like country music. <SEP> Yeah. And they they like uh they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers. Oh yeah. Yeah. And and uh well my my my my parents. <SEP> The Blackwoods. Yeah. My husband likes uh country music real well. And he he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah. Yeah. And yeah. He really likes Shenandoah. <SEP> Alabama. Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah. Alabama. Uh. I think I think they're a bit over exposed. <SEP> Yeah. I get kind of tire- get tir- tired of every other song being Alabama on the radio. <SEP> Yeah. Either Alabama or Hank Williams Junior. Oh I I've never cared for Hank Williams Junior. <SEP> I never have either. And I never have figured out how he won uh entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row. Oh. <SEP> Oh we we watch those award shows too. We enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff. But I just I just don't care for him. Yeah. I just never have. I don't. <SEP> I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is uh probably Eddy Arnold. Is is it? Uh-huh. Okay. I I think I I know who that is. Uh-huh. I think my parents have have uh some of his records. <SEP> But uh I got a I've got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh I sold some of them I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western songs. Yeah. Wow. <SEP> Smiley Burnette I don't know if you were old enough to remember him him. I've heard the name. He was uh played in the old western movies. He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe. Huh. <SEP> Or they. I think his name in in the movie was Froggy. And. I've I've never seen a Gene Autry movie. Had a real raspy voice. Huh. <SEP> And uh. Some of those old ones of course Bob Wills Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an. No. I never have. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Those go back quite a way. Yeah. I took them up here to Collectors Rector- Records and was able to get a little money for them. Yeah. <SEP> But uh my m- mother and dad use to uh own a restaurant. It's hard to. Oh yeah. <SEP> And he had uh they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant. Yeah. And when they would come and change the records the guys would the guy would give her the old records. Well that wou-. That's neat. <SEP> So that's where I got my. That would be gr- great if they weren't too worn out at the time. Yeah. <SEP> Of course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records. Is there not? You you'd well you'd think there would be. Well the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle. Well that's true. <SEP> Oh yeah. And uh they just won't play on a modern day uh phonograph. <SEP> Well that's a shame. Because I I we go to antique stores a lot. And you see seventy-eights a a lot at at the stores a- a- at record stores. <SEP> Yeah. You'd think there'd be a market for. Yeah. I'm I'm sure you could find old players for them. But that would cost a fortune if you could find them that worked. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Oh. <SEP> Of course they you know just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because you you get that scratchy sound. No. Uh-huh. Well those things were big and thick weren't they? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. You could kill somebody with them. Yeah. Th-. Warped real easy. And the ones you buy. Go out and buy one now. And they're just so thin and flimsy. <SEP> Yeah. And they just they're not meant to last at all. Yeah. Ne- neither are tapes. I I bu- we buy cassette tapes. <SEP> Yeah. And machines will eat them. Yeah. And so the best bet any anymo- these days are compact disk. Those things are practically indestructible. <SEP> But I I guess you know the old country and western music you. Back then when I was a kid there wasn't that much T V. Oh no. So that's all you had to listen to was the radio. Radio. <SEP> And uh. Tha- that's just what just what you had. We-. Plus. Yeah. I think it was better back then to. Th- there's too much T V now. <SEP> Yeah. And the radio is you know more exciting really than than television. Yeah. Kep-. Your imagination. <SEP> Yeah. I- i- kept. And yo-. It just didn't vegetate your mind like television does. Yeah. I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Was it on the radio every week? Yeah. Wha- what day what day was that on. Do you ha- can you recall. <SEP> Uh uh seems like it was on a Friday. Uh. Friday or.
