Now is it Stacy? Angie. Angie. I'm sorry. <SEP> Okay. Well now so if you were going to have a dinner party what would you make? Um let's see. Uh I like seafood. Uh let's see. Uh shrimp steamed she- uh shellfish with maybe herbs. Uh spicy lobster with lem- linguini. That sounds good. <SEP> Yeah. Now what is uh what is uh the steamed shellfish you said? Uh-huh. And what would that be like a clam or uh. <SEP> Right. Okay. Yeah. Uh I think hors d'oeuvres are good too. Uh and that way you can have a variety. Uh. So if you have a a dinner party and you're going to serve uh seafood for supper what type of uh hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal? <SEP> Uh. Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or. Yeah. Fresh vegetables would be good. Or uh just. Probably not nachos and dip huh? <SEP> No. And would you uh would it be appropriate to uh drink with the uh prior when you have the hors d'oeuvres? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with uh with the with seafood? <SEP> Oh all these hard questions. Uh what white wine? That would be my guess. <SEP> Yeah. And And then uh uh dessert. I'm not really a drinker. So I'm not I don't know a lot about that. Something sweet? <SEP> Oh goodness. Uh chocolate something chocolate. Uh. You must like chocolate. Yes. Well let's see. Usually when we have a dinner party I always I like to grill. <SEP> Oh you do? So we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some uh some dip uh some cheese. One of our favorites is uh to take some let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think is that what comes in those little blocks? And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and uh wash them and cool them and then dump them in the uh sauce and then take crackers. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese. And you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail. And then I like to barbecue like steaks or pork chops. And then we have uh s- oh lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad. Uh-huh. And then uh I don't know what we usually have for dessert. Cake sometimes. But uh that's what we would do for a dinner party I guess. <SEP> That sounds good too. But that's I guess when you talk about dinner party that's probably not uh that's more for like when friends come over. Traditional. <SEP> Right? Traditional. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't be the big uh snotty kind. <SEP> I just started I just really started uh uh learning about that. And I bought a Martha Stewart. I don't know if you've heard of her. Huh-uh. <SEP> Her cookbook. And she talks about catering and uh you know goes into goes into all that and the different types of uh uh different types of parties you know different types of foods. Oh well do you work in a uh in a setting where you uh are in the food business? Um my father owns a restaurant. Oh in uh Is it in Dallas? <SEP> It's it's just a uh c- a cafe. So it's not really anything you know that I want to. It's not the same. Uh it's in Lewisville. Okay. All right. So you graduated from which high school? <SEP> Trinity. Trinity. Okay. And that's a public school or private? That's public. Huh okay. I have to get to know this area a little better I guess. Uh well is your father's cafe uh one that you could cater out of? <SEP> No. Uh-huh. It's not. Um and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably. <SEP> Uh. Well let's see. What else for catering. Uh. Let's see. What about Hawaiian luau. Oh that would be good. <SEP> Could have uh uh fruits and and pineapple uh. Let's see uh. And you could actually go with uh a chicken if you wanted to. I think I think decorating your food is you know really.
