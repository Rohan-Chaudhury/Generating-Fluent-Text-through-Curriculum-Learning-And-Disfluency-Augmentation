Well what do you think about it? Well um most of the stuff up until now in the recent months I I I don't have any problem with. No. I don't either. <SEP> Uh I mean it's. You know it. I don't think it's going to change very much. But. No. I agree with that. As as far as the as far as the mess that's developing as a result um you know. As a country the United States uh. I think our hands are tied as far as as as any further involvement until the U N sanctions it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. In fact it really was to begin with. Yeah. <SEP> And uh I just I heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the the the internal problems um somebody may step in again. Uh-huh. But uh I really think it's it's a U N issue at that point because it is internal. Yeah. <SEP> Well you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy. Uh-huh. And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in in Iraq they're going crazy. <SEP> That's right. That's right. You know I mean you can't please them one way or the other. Absolutely right. You know and I and I think that I I agree with you. This is exactly the right course. I mean that's an internal problem to Iraq. It has nothing to do with us. <SEP> Uh-huh. And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved then it's nobody's business. That's right. Um. <SEP> I mean these these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time. All the time. I mean yeah. I mean. Some of them have been going on for for tens of years if if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years. Yeah. And it's going to continue. <SEP> That's right. As long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time. Yeah. That's absolutely right. I mean the Kurds have tried it before. They've gotten their butts kicked. <SEP> Yeah. And this is just another time that it's happening. That's that's absolutely right. You know they'll regroup out in the mountains. And they'll try it again in a couple of years. <SEP> Yeah. It was just you know it was. It's a very opportune moment for them to try. You know you. Sure. And and and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. You know. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. But I'm not real sure that we promised them anything. Uh-huh. I. That would have been stupid. <SEP> Yeah. And and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that. Yeah. I agree. But it just it it really doesn't make any difference. This is just a a another chapter in Middle Eastern history. <SEP> Yeah. And you know and it there are many of them. There's no doubt about it. Oh sure. I mean the the British occupied the place. The French occupied it. We've done it. It it's happened so many times. This is this is really nothing special. Uh. Uh-huh. Well and and and so many of the so many of the conflicts um really don't have a basis in in uh politics or or human rights or anything like that. It It's it's religious based. That's right. It's al- it's mostly religious anyway. <SEP> And uh you know by by self-proclamation this is a holy war. And it is right. Yeah. And then uh we we go on from there. And. Yeah. Exactly. <SEP> Yeah. It it's it's a mess. It it's. There's no doubt about it. And uh. Well I I I think one of the big problems. I mean looking at it from the Am- the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners. That's right. They don't understand what. I mean their politics really isn't politics. It's religion couched as politics. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And there's a big difference. Absolutely. You know uh we sit there. And and we think that they think the way we think. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that's a big mistake because they don't. You bet. <SEP> You bet. Well yeah. Because there's no uh you know there's there's there's a complete different set of values. Uh-huh. Um there's there's different value placed on human life and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And uh what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases. That's that's it a lot of the time. I I was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half. <SEP> Okay. And it it was tough under- understanding those folks. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. You know it they they're they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously. Uh-huh. It's just it was very strange. <SEP> I believe it. It was very interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I can I can I can believe that. Yeah. I I don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means. But uh. Now I. Shoot I I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't don't have a clue sometimes. <SEP> That's probably true. That's probably true. You know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert. Uh-huh. Well I'm not real sure that's that's appropriate. <SEP> No. No. That's that's uh. A a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field. No. But uh. Well I sort. That sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too. <SEP> Yeah. And we make experts by reading books. That's right. You know and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing. <SEP> Uh-huh. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I uh I I guess you work for T I. <SEP> That's right yes. So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else. Right. Right. That's an everyday occurrence. Yeah. It's it's like our car industry. The only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese you know came into it and helped us out. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I agree. Yeah. It's it's uh there there is there is it's an overall problem in in in this country understanding uh foreign cultures or even accepting them. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it it it bites us over and over. Again the the the. Yeah. And until we until we start changing our educational system I mean we're we're going to be. We're we've already been overtaken. But it's going to get even worse later. Uh-huh. I mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything. <SEP> That's right. It's not us. That's right. You know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and you know underwater psychology or some some ridiculous stuff like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Absolutely. And and where are the engineers coming from? Uh well they're they're coming from various places. And a lot of them are going back there. Yeah. Exactly. <SEP> That's. My uh my roommate is a uh. He's getting his doctorate in industrial. Well it's not industrial engineering. It's human factors. Okay. His degree was in uh industrial engineering. <SEP> I see. Uh and he's from the Philippines. Yeah. And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it. <SEP> Right. He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs. Sure. Okay. You know uh but I I see it all too often. I mean we've got loads of foreign students. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they're coming here going after the hard degrees. And then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else. Absolutely. And they're applying it there. <SEP> That's right. And I don't know. It's to me it's amazing. I don't know what we're going to do as a country. We're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later. Yeah. Bec- you know every every. The the country's got a problem with uh with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> And the long long-range views are are just kind of become a thing of the past. Yeah. You. And uh. I don't I don't think there can be anymore long range planning. I think it it's it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know it oh here's a crisis. Well let's plug it up. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. It's far beyond me. <SEP> Yeah. That's for sure. That's that's the way things have gotten. Yeah. All we can do is keep plugging. Yeah. You know I I wonder. I I read in the paper just last week I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well at a price tag of six thousand bucks I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers. No. Absolutely. Be-. Now I have the I- I have the I B M P S two. <SEP> Okay. But I'm sorry I got it. Yeah. It's slow. It's uh there are many better machines on the market right now for a. <SEP> Yeah. The only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school. Okay. <SEP> Okay. And I saved forty-eight percent. Uh-huh. So I said yeah if I can have an I B M for forty-eight percent discount I'll take it. <SEP> Absolutely. But up to that point I had nev- I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name. That's right. But. <SEP> That's absolutely right. Yeah. Now you watch. Just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. The the. Unfortunately the way the the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get get something in your hands. Uh-huh. Um. It's already outdated. <SEP> It it's it's obsolete. And uh we're we we fight that battle every day here at work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I can imagine. <SEP> And uh. I uh years ago I remember when I had a T I ninety-nine. Put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other. Uh-huh. And uh things just kept changing so much. And I kept getting rid of them. And I finally said well you can't do this. <SEP> That's right. You've got to buy something and stick with it. So I so I just. That's right. At an opportune time I got one that that suited my needs. And I've just stuck with it. The only thing I've done to it is just add a uh add a mouse and a hard drive. <SEP> Okay. Yeah. And that's all I plan to do. Of course I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line. I got the model twenty-five. Oh okay. So I'm stuck with six forty. But I'm not a power user. So it doesn't matter. <SEP> Yeah. Well that that's that's the key you know what- whatever works for you. Yeah. And uh if it does the job then that's that's what you need. Yeah. Now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user. <SEP> He's he's looking now to get rid of his. He's got a three eighty-six and wants to get a four eighty-six. You know this kind of stuff. Uh-huh.
