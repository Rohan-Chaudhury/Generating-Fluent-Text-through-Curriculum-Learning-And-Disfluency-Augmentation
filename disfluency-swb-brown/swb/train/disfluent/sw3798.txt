Well Michael what do you think about uh funding for AIDS research? Do you. Well uh uh that's something I've thought a lot about. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I I work in a hospital. Uh-huh. And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years. And I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh when they asked us did did we want to uh keep it the same or uh spend more spend less I think uh I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh my for my personal opinion. Uh because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with. Yeah. <SEP> Or I think they already would have by now you know. Uh-huh. And uh so I don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now. I think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh what about you? Well I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now. You know. I'm not either. <SEP> I'm definitely not aware of how much. Yeah. Uh that's something I've never really kept up with at all. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Uh I don't I'm not sure uh. I mean I. Go ahead. I know uh I've always thought more about the disease rather than the der- research. You know what I mean? Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And uh that sort of thing. Uh if if we were talking about the money uh I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because I don't know that much about it. You know. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I mean I I can see that research is needed. And you know. Oh yeah. Definitely. <SEP> I think so. I think so. I mean it's becoming a major problem. Yeah. But uh. I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more You know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Well that's true. That's true because uh it's a such an easily preventable disease. Right. And I I feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer. <SEP> Uh. It's it's uh abstinence in certain cases. No. <SEP> It's definitely not. And. That's true. That's true. Yeah. <SEP> Uh. And knowing you know. Myself uh uh I'm just recently or about to get a divorce. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh course I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything. Yeah. But it's sort of scary to find yourself single again you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh because you never know what's going to happen. You don't know who you're going to come across you know. Yeah. Course it's it's not that I'm wanting to I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see. Uh-huh. <SEP> But it's something you got to think about these days. Yeah. A single person. You know. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> And uh. I think for a lot of people it has. Certainly. So. <SEP> Yeah. So. But uh uh I know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Drug addicts. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And uh I don't know. I don't think that's a bad idea. Uh-huh. <SEP> I know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction. Yeah. It just sort of keeps that going. Yeah. <SEP> But uh I don't know. At least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far can not be. You know. Uh-huh. So I don't know. That I think that's. I'm not too a- much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself. Uh-huh. <SEP> I don't know. What do you think about that? Well yeah. Boy that's a hard issue. It It really is. <SEP> It really is. It really is. They gave us a hard topic. Yeah. I mean I I definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed. But as you say uh people I mean in the meantime. Well someone who's not ready to give up drugs uh You know. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's true. <SEP> That's true. If they're perp- perpetrating the AIDS problem passing that on to each other then you know. Yeah. <SEP> You know I guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first I guess as far as something to to do about it. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. So so I don't know. Uh course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know. Yeah. <SEP> And uh so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse. Which is the most important to solve at the time. Yeah. And. Uh-huh. <SEP> I don't know. Yeah. But uh but I've never looked into how much money they're spending. I have I have no idea. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that. Yeah. But uh I really have never looked into it. I have no idea. Yeah. I haven't either. I've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And Mostly that's what I've heard. <SEP> Right. Sure. So I don't know. Yeah. And yet I know it's uh it sounds like big money to me. <SEP> Yeah. But it probably takes a lot. I think it is. <SEP> I think it is. Yeah. It does every. So. <SEP> It seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do. It seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would. You know. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> But uh. Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that. That's one thing I've never really feared. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh uh I. A lot of the my family you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions. But uh uh I don't fear it at all. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I work in in the operating room a lot. Uh-huh. And uh and of course when w-.
