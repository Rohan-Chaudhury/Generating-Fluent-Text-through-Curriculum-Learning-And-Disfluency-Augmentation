Do you have any pets now? Oh I sure do. I have a cat and a dog named Joey. Joey. Th- the dog is Joey? <SEP> Uh-huh. The cat is. He's the little boy Pomeranian. Oh my goodness. <SEP> And we just got a new addition to the family so to speak. We also have a fish. Oh my. It's a mud dog. I beg your pardon. <SEP> It's a mud dog. It's uh a cross between a catfish and uh I don't know what a salamander. Oh. Well did you all catch it. Or uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. We have a cat Stripper. Uh-huh. Oh the mud dog. No. Did. No. Did you catch the fish? <SEP> Uh we had a friend give it to us. Uh-huh. And it's all alone in that aquarium. Yeah. We'd like to get him a friend. But um uh we haven't found one yet. So how about you. Do you have any pets? Well at the present time I have two dogs. <SEP> Oh really. What kind? An English setter you know. That's the white dog with the feathers. And it has uh yellow spots on it which they call I think uh liver spots. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that's a male. And I have a wonderful female lab black lab. Uh-huh. How long have you had them. Quite a long time uh probably five or six years. And unfortunately the black lab that's a female it tha- it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had. An i-. When she was about three years old we noticed that she was having pro- uh problems limping and so forth. And she has hip dysplasia. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh no. And it's in that breed. <SEP> Uh-huh. But now I think there are tests that can be conducted uh to tell whether or not the puppies have the have it. Uh-huh. But I think. I don't know. Apparently they've been so in well I don't know inbred or what. But. <SEP> Oh is that right? Well n-. I'm not sure that's the situation. But it um. For those dogs that are registered. And if if you should have one uh that also has hip dysplasia you can not breed it uh. Huh. I had no idea. I hadn't didn't even know that. Uh-huh. But she's wonderful. <SEP> Um our dog Joey has uh a back problem. Um like ha-. What are the what are the symptoms? Uh he he's got a bad back. But he's seven uh. I guess he's abo- almost eight years old. <SEP> Um he just uh. He doesn't. He uh yo- he rolls o-. He doesn't like to roll over. Uh-huh. Um e-. You just. When you touch him a certain way on the back. Yes. <SEP> But otherwise he can jump uh you know just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way. Um. Well uh I have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh. When i-. Uh let's see winter before last we would bring her in and uh when it was cold. Uh-huh. And she wouldn't. I you know. The next morning you want to take them out. And she wouldn't. I couldn't get her up without p- picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds. <SEP> I bet. Um until. If I allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon. Uh-huh. Anyway I uh met my son's uh college roommate is a vet. And he said um let's give her some race horse shots. And you know in. I'm I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems. <SEP> Oh yeah. Anyway that's when we lived in Oklahoma. And uh so he gave this dog a series of. It's. They give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage. Uh-huh. And it's called. Anyway it's a series of six shots once a week. And then I noticed after two shots she was. <SEP> Do you have to give those? Well I could have. But I can't give a shot. Oh I. Believe me I understand. I took her from Enid Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks. <SEP> Uh. And uh after the the second shot she was significantly better. Then I didn't notice any improvement till the after the sixth one. Uh-huh. And ever since. And he said uh a booster uh every year or two I mean maybe every six months or or something like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. And when I notice in the winter when it's worse you know it's cold weather and so forth then I have uh gotten a booster for her. But not many people in this part of the country know anything about. Um. I've had to get it from Oklahoma. They've heard about it. But they've really never used it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I've never heard anything about it either. So dogs that get down in the hips. Like I think German Shepherds do it and probably large dogs. Uh-huh. And uh it's just wonderful. <SEP> Does he get. Is he an inside dog also. Uh. Or does he just run out in the backyard? Is he fenced in? Um um well we're living now in an area where we we we're in the woods. And we take walks. I just don't let them uh uh go away from me. <SEP> Oh yeah. Uh-huh. But we take walks through the woods twice a day. Oh that's nice. And uh I can over do it on her. <SEP> Oh yeah. But anyway at least she can go. And she's not limping along and all that. Uh-huh. Tell me about your cat. <SEP> Oh Stripper well he started out being a little orphan. And we we took him in. And uh he's about two years old now. And he loves his treats. Uh both uh Joey and uh Stripper get treats. And uh let's see. And is um Stripper an inside cat or outside? Oh well he's outside. And uh he's got a way to get in. Uh-huh. <SEP> He's got free access of a window we like to keep open. Yes. So he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to. Well of course. <SEP> That's nice. They they. Joey on the other hand is a little different. He has to go out whenever uh we ask him. And when he when we ask him he uh he barks. He'll either bark for food or he'll bark to go out. And he'll tell you which one he wants. He's been through obedience school. Well he just can. Well he has been trained. And you've ke- you've kept u- it up haven't you. <SEP> Oh definitely. Yeah. It is wonderful. I I have some neighbors across the field. And um they. When we first moved here uh when the dogs and I didn't fe-. We have a very nice kennel and everything. But but since I I didn't want to. I wa- I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while. Uh-huh. So I kept watch and never let them get away. But now every couple weeks they wou- one would slip away. And my neighbor said to me oh I noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained. Anytime they hear your voice they come. So that made me very proud. <SEP> Oh yeah. Well have we been talking five minutes? I'm not for sure. I'm not either. But. <SEP> I think maybe we have. But. Yeah. Well um so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure. Oh definitely. Have you ever done this before? Yes. <SEP> Oh okay um. I haven't ever called. I've put in the paper work I just never made the call. Oh really. Uh-huh. Yeah. So I didn't know if they stop you when the time is up. Or. No. They don't. No. I I glanced at the clock when um we started. And I think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something. But one day I was talking to a lady about gardening. And I'm I love gardening. And she did too. An and after after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh well at least you know you did your part. Uh-huh. But it's been so much fun too uh talk. How did you get into this. Well my best friend in Virginia's daughter is a part of this project in Texas. <SEP> Oh I see. And so she knew that I had the time and would be would enjoy it. Uh-huh. That's true. Um so. <SEP> I mean I. But I have a hard time getting anybody because I guess. Do you work. Um yes. I do. Yeah. And probably just got home. <SEP> Uh-huh. So um during the day I me-. I thi-. And I understand also they want men. Right. I was going to tell you the same thing. They're really looking for a lot more men to participate. Yeah. My husband does. <SEP> Does he. Yeah. I need to. Yes. I've got some applications. I need to hand them out. But uh this is a great project that they're working on. And it's really going to lead the way uh for a lot of econ- um applications and and development in the voice area. Yes. Wh- I think so too. And I haven't helped them out on the me- on men particularly. But my husband had been ma- in fact he's been probably has made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time. <SEP> Uh-huh. I try to you know make them do during the day. But nobody's home. Well this is the perfect time for me. Well good. <SEP> Well maybe I'll get you next time. Yeah. It so fo- much fun to talk to you. All right. Have a good one. You too. Bye. <SEP> Bye.
