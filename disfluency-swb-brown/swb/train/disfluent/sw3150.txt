So how do you feel about capital punishment? Well it's. I am pretty much against it. Really? <SEP> Yeah. How about you? Oh I'm pretty much for it. Oh good. We can have a debate. We'll have some interesting discussion I guess. <SEP> Well like um I don't know. I c- think that I. One of the reasons that I'm against it is that uh um I'm afraid of someone losing their life for s- um wrongly. Wrongfully. Yeah. Right. Yeah. <SEP> And uh another reason. One of the arguments that really I really actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh you know someone said to me once well imagine if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldn't you want to see them killed for the punishment? But then I thought about it. And I thought well the loss that I would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them. Yeah. It would never be equal. <SEP> Right. Right. Yeah. <SEP> How about you? Well I guess you know I I guess I can see it from several different perspectives. But you know when I hear about things like you know what they've what they've been reporting about in Milwaukee you know I I to me I don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy. You know maybe there is I don't know. Yeah. That's true. But you know and you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society. He's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation. <SEP> Uh-hum. I mean I don't know. I just I really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko. And you know for the things he's done. I don't know. I guess it's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life you know or or capital punishment I guess. You know. Right. Well you know that's true because um m- b- a lot of um these conversations I've had on this program this these telephone conversations have revolved around um criminal you know justice. An- and- Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh really. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or whatever. And most of the time I hear myself saying well you know we don't have enough room left in the jails. And people crime is still climbing. <SEP> And we need to have different punishments you know. Right. But I just am scared of capital punishment I guess. Yeah. Well I can underst-. <SEP> I I mean you know there there is always that chance. But you know I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever I don't I mean I don't know. But uh you know but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gon na be you know. You you you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really. But uh you know when I you find somebody just like that situation I mean it was disgusting when I read about it today. And and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven I I'd you know I guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him. Uh-huh. And you know. Right. <SEP> Right. Especially when it's so far removed. If it's no one that I know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life. <SEP> Right. Right. <SEP> And trying to rehabilitate him too. And you know. Letting him out again. Right. Exactly. And uh you know nobody wants that. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know everybody would be just as scared to death you know. We we've had a real problem here in Texas with uh prison overcrowding. And they've been releasing people left and right. And you know they've committed murders and rapes and everything else. And you know you just think you know where's the justice here. Uh-huh. I mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving. <SEP> That's true. You know I just recently moved to Massachusetts. I'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment. And that was one of the questions. But uh I do know that they are notorious for paroling people. Oh really? Yeah. When they're when. And then having them reconvicted for violent crimes. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And I guess they said you know sh- do you think it should be restricted? I guess if it were if if. Because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment. Uh-huh. <SEP> I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense. Yeah. You know violent crimes with no uh with just malicious intent. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Well you know that's exactly I mean I'm I'm not saying I I think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know. And I I think there's a a shadow of a doubt you know like with this this guy in in Milwaukee. I mean it. He pretty much confessed to it. I mean they you know. Just everything I mean cannibalism and everything else uh. <SEP> Yeah. I really would have a hard time especially if I was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed. Yeah. Hang? Because I mean that's just awful. <SEP> And what is he going to do prison to the other people? Right. Well I have a hun- I have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway. Either. I mean you know they. I don't know. From from what I hear about jail life is not any way to live. Right. But uh I don't know. It's just. <SEP> Well I was I saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back. She was off drugs and everything. Uh-huh. But she said uh you know in prison you can get anything. You can any drugs you want. There's. It it's just like being outside. You know people find ways around. Really. <SEP> And there's a power structure that you have bow to. And and it really isn't for some people tha- who have been there for over and over and over it really isn't uh as bad. I mean there's. It's not that bad of a life as it should be b- for the punishment aspect. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> But the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation. And maybe that's why one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it's not so scary anymore. Yeah. That. Yeah. Well you know especially like repeat offenders. It it just appalls me that they can be out you know they even get a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years. You know that's that's scary because you know I'm not sure I think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not. <SEP> Right. And what they're going to be doing when they get out. Right. And it it's it's really scary. I me- you know. I I don't know what the perfect solution to that is. But I know that especially with violent crimes where you know you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else you know then I don't know I I guess I I just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee you know. For instance I mean that's just. I could see capital punishment in a case like that. And you know for for other people too that do things like that. But uh when. Uh my wife and I are both participating in this survey. And she picked up the phone. And when she heard the topic she said capital punishment. So she was uh. <SEP> Handed it to you? Yeah. Well luckily it was for me. Because they want th- they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other. <SEP> Oh oh I see. So she tried to enter her number. And it wouldn't work. So she said whew it's for you. So but uh you know I don't know. I I struggle with it. But I I really think that in in terms of like this I'd I think that it it might not be such a bad thing. Because I don't know that anybody w- in- I don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community. You know I I I'm su-. You'd have to be scared to death. <SEP> Well maybe if they could uh. If they had more money or more more resources to work more on rehabilitation. I mean deep down I think every every human.
