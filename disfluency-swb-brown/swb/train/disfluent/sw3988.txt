Favorite type of music or musician or any. I don't really have a favorite type. I like uh a lot of different types of music. Do you? <SEP> Yeah. I have a a tape collection that I like to listen to uh cassette tapes. Uh-huh. But it's pretty varied. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. How about you? Oh I I'm very uh I'm very varied as well. I uh I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for uh maybe you know heavy metal and that. That's exactly me. The acid rock or the heavy metal. Yeah. <SEP> Even some of that I like okay but not mostly as a general rule. Yeah. I don't care for that at all. Yeah. I don't enjoy rap too much either. That that doesn't appeal to uh my ears. <SEP> Well as far as the rap goes I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I like some of their songs. Oh. But as as. I agree with the general rule I I wouldn't choose rap either. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I I like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz uh classical um. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I don't. I like uh like I said pretty varied uh music. Uh-huh. I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to like Billy Holiday. Oh. <SEP> I really love to listen to her. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I even have a a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo. Oh gosh. And well I mean they're very harmonic. Uh-huh. <SEP> They really are. Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure. So they're interesting to listen to. You might try that. How about you? Well um I listen to uh specific. Most most likely I would be listen to uh jazz or classical music. Um I in college I took uh four years of classical guitar. And I played in the in the jazz combo all four years. I play guitar for the jazz combo. <SEP> Oh yeah? So uh that's where my two my two listening enjoyments are. But you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while. Uh you can't just listen to it you know to uh especially a lot of the deeper stuff. You just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're. Yeah unless unless you're playing it. It's too um uh. You have to concentrate on it it seems. It just it just doesn't do anything. <SEP> What about the blues or something like that? Uh uh blues are okay. I I tell you I do like um. I grew up on blue grass music. My dad is a big blue grass fan. And so. Uh-huh. Um I wouldn't have admitted it when I was in high school. But I really do like it a lot. <SEP> So. I I like some of it um. As far as like the cou- what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it? No. It doesn't. It doesn't. <SEP> Um some of it sounds more like pop music. Yeah. Uh they've all got you know the real screechy electric guitars now. Oh n-. Yeah. I don't care for that. If I'm going to listen to today's country western I have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black. Yeah. <SEP> And I even liked Jim Reeves you know. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I I. Yeah. I grew up on him. Uh-huh. Or uh what what Merle Haggard and Faron Young. <SEP> Uh-huh. That type of country western is what I I like to listen to. Sure. <SEP> Asleep At The Wheel. Uh Sons of the Pioneers you know stuff like that. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Um oh I like sound tracks a lot. Oh do you? Yeah. It seems like you get a lot of original music that way. Yeah.

Um I like instrumental things. Uh-huh. Um I have some Spiro Gyro tapes. Oh they're great aren't they. <SEP> Oh they're wonderful. Yeah. I love them. I have some dulcimer music. I mean like I said that that's pretty varied. Yeah. It sure is. Yeah. <SEP> Al Jarreau he's somebody I like. He's pretty kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop too. Uh-huh. Yeah. I like his. He has a nice smooth voice. <SEP> Oh yeah. And you know what I like the most about him is I've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he's having fun. Yeah. Sure. I mean some people sing. And they have their faced all contorted like it hurts them or something. <SEP> But he looks like he's having a good time.
