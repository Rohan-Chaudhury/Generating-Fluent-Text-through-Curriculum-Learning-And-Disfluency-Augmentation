Okay. This is really ironic that this would I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away. Oh no. And it's just been tearing me up all day. <SEP> Oh I bet. Because we have just been looking all over for him. We've been to the pound. We've been to the humane society. We've been to the adoption center. We've just been all over the neighborhood. We've been calling neighbors. So this is just really strange. Oh I guess so. Have you lost him before? No. This is the first time. Um he's gotten out before. But he's always stayed right here you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. He's never gone away. And so this is just really strange you know because. What kind of a dog is he? Um he's part golden Lab and part uh let's see Alaskan no not Alaskan. I always forget. <SEP> Yeah. Uh Australian shepherd. Oh. And Yeah. <SEP> Boy he's a big one. He's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me you know that he hasn't come back because like I said he's never gone away like this before. And I would think you know he might I mean he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big. Yeah. You know but I don't know. <SEP> Oh well I hope he comes back. That's too bad. Thanks. I do too. How long have you had him? Oh about two years. So he's. <SEP> Oh that's tough. Yeah. It's really. Gosh anyway. Yeah. You get very attached to animals don't you? That isn't that funny how we do? <SEP> Yeah. I mean we just really. Well you know they're always there for you. And they don't talk back to you. Yeah. <SEP> And uh it's kind of pleasant. Well they're companions. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Well do you have any? <SEP> Yes. We have a dog a little white Lhasa. And her name is Angel. And we have a cat who a white cat. He's he's just a Tabby just a. And his name is Dominique. We call him Neek. Um. But. How do they get along together? <SEP> Pretty good. Uh we've we had the the dog first. And uh she's kind of a wimp. And and the cat kind of rules. But uh she likes him all right. He we had another cat about two years ago. It got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep. Um. <SEP> And uh then we got this new cat. So uh. I have two children. And they really enjoy the animals. And then my mother who's very elderly lives with us. And she's really good friends with the dog. They're very good buddies. Oh yeah. That's what are so neat about animals. I mean they are you know like I said they're they're really companions you know. And they're friends you know. <SEP> That's right. I mean they you can love them all you want. And they love you right back. And they don't. That's right. They don't care what you look like or what you act like. No. <SEP> They just love you unconditionally. I know. <SEP> It's wonderful. It's just so neat. You know. It's. That's. I don't know. This is just so hard. Oh I know it has to be. It's just it's like I said we've had him for two years. And he's never. I mean he's he's gotten out. But he's always been right there. He's never been gone for at all. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You know he's just always been right there when he gets out. Oh. You know it's the first time he's ever been gone like this. <SEP> Oh that's really too bad. That's awful well. Uh I I just knew today uh you know that we looked at the pound and that we just went all over the place. And I knew we were going to find him you know. And when we didn't it was like oh no. So I don't know. Well I I'll I hope you'll find him. You most likely will. Yeah. We keep you know. They told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know. And then Well not yet. <SEP> Well have you put any posters up or anything like that? We were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday. We were just talking about that whether. We we were trying to find some pictures of him recently. We've got so many when he was a puppy. Uh-huh. Yeah. You know but we just don't have a whole lot. We have him on film you know on the video camera. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. You know but you can't put that on the. No. You sure can't. You know so So I don't know. <SEP> Oh dear. I we will probably will put some things up. Some posters and stuff up. Well that's good. And hopefully that will help you know maybe around the neighborhood. But we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood. So that helps too you know if they can keep. <SEP> They can keep their eyes open. Yeah. Yeah. So. That will help. Well. I think that if somebody else picks him up. I think that uh if he gets out he'll come back. <SEP> Yeah. You know. I really do because he knows exactly where he lives. So. Yeah. Yeah. He will. I bet he does. <SEP> I know that it's hard on you. I know that I'd be worried too. I know. It's just like it's it's just so ironic that this would happen. And I would get this this kind of a call. Yeah. Isn't it though? I know. <SEP> That's. It's very strange. But. You know I know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night. And when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him. And and uh if he doesn't come by mid morning then I really get scared. But he's always come back eventually. So. Well that's good. That's one thing about cats though. They're so small. <SEP> Yeah. And you know they can get hurt a lot easier. Yeah. You know they can get hurt a lot easier you know. <SEP> Yeah. They can. So that would make you really tend to worry about them you know if they're not right there. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well but he's a real feisty guy. He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property. Is that right? <SEP> He's. Cats are really almost more territorial than than dogs are. They just really do not want other animals on their property. They're very very. He he just. Any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't he won't jump at them or anything. But he'll sit. And he'll watch. And I think maybe he would if it came real close. But he's very protective of our property. Huh. That's really. I I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them. Uh-huh. So I never had them growing up. <SEP> Yeah. So you know I never really had them around me you know. So I've never owned one you know since I. Well they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not they're very independent. And they're very he's very affectionate when he wants to be. But if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll just he'll you know either scratch you or run away. Huh. <SEP> But when he wants to be uh he's really affectionate. He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and and and snuggle up to you. And but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him. Huh. But dogs seem to be always in the mood. They're always you know right there and like like you to pet them and loving. Yeah. That's true. I I like the way they come up. And they'll they'll put their head underneath your hand you know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah oh. That. And uh most dogs do that. I mean. Yeah. They do. I don't know any that really don't. I mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know. <SEP> They sure do. They just you know come up. And they put your you know. Yeah. Or they'll rub their their head against you you know. <SEP> Now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-. Well no. Well well he's outside during the day. And then we get home at night we do bring him in. You have a fenced yard or. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. The backyard it's really big too for him to run in and stuff. That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out you know because he's had all this room to run in. Yeah. And but. <SEP> Well how did he get out? He dug a hole under the fence. Oh boy. Well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole. And you know we we filled it back up put him back in there. <SEP> Uh-huh. He did it again. Uh-huh. So we chained him up. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because you know we feel like that's just too restricting for him. Right. Right. So uh we got we we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it you know so that he couldn't get out. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire. Oh. So I can't. I I I just have not. I don't understand you know because it's like he's got a good home you know. He's got. I mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. You know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know. We just couldn't. Well you know that animals are like that. They like to roam and investigate. And see what's going on. Yeah. I guess that's. <SEP> Yeah. I guess that's probably true. I don't think it's anything we did. No. Least I hope not. <SEP> No. I'm sure that yeah. No. I I know. I mean he's always you know he really does have a good home. I think that's what really bothers me the most about it. Yeah. You know it's like. <SEP> How are your kids handling it? Well I don't know if it's quite hit him hit them. Uh-huh. I have two girls. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they they just been real uh. I don't know. At first you know they seemed to be upset. But now it's like uh well if he doesn't come home can we get another dog. Yeah. That sounds like kids. It's like wait a minute you know. <SEP> Oh. Poor Buddy you know. I said he's only been gone a day. And you already want to replace him. What's his name. Did you call? Buddy. <SEP> Buddy? Uh-huh. We that's was our cat's name that that that died. Is that right? <SEP> Oh yeah. We named him uh we named him Buddy after uh Buddy Bell uh the Ranger baseball player that used to be here. Oh. And we used to. We were really into that when we got him going to the Ranger games. And we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason. <SEP> But Buddy after Buddy Bell. So. That's funny. But he was he was a good cat too. We miss him a lot. Yeah. <SEP> And I I feel real guilty because we had him like for six years. And one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster. And he got it. Oh. And I just felt so bad. I it's real contagious. And it's. And the vet said it runs rampant in this area. I didn't know that. <SEP> And if they don't have their booster any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically like. They get it if the other cat has it. So. I had I had no idea. Oh. I did not know that. <SEP> Oh. It was. I just felt terrible. I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was. He was just getting real skinny.
