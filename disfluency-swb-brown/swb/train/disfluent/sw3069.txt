Yeah. Yes. I talked with um I talked with people from Richardson and Plano. And uh the first three days. And then yesterday I talked with someone with from Pennsylvania. So. Yeah. Because. It's the. <SEP> I've only made. This is only my third call. Oh. I I tried to make calls two different days. And I couldn't get through. Oh I know. Sometimes I just. I'm in. It just takes a very long time. So. <SEP> Does it? Yeah. I've been trying to you know do that. And and sometimes I just can't wait that long. Yeah. I know. So I just hang up. Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again. Well. <SEP> This is hilarious. But I knew as soon as I heard your voice. I thought Kathy's it's Kathy Kester. Oh. Well tell me what books have you read lately? <SEP> Well let's see. I um gosh I can't even think. I haven't read any. And you're such a reader I know that. And I. Well I don't read all that much for enjoyment. I mean I read a lot for school. But gee I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading. Yeah. The the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it was um it was called um SMART WOMEN I think. Um or something like that. Um. Yeah. <SEP> And it was it was kind of. I really didn't like it at all. Huh. It was it was written back in the early eighties. Oh yeah. <SEP> And it was all this this um divorced woman syndrome of the um. Oh yeah. It was almost like a a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing. Interesting. <SEP> It was really an interesting. Because I I right away looked at when it was copyrighted. Because I could tell by the theme of almost when it was written. Uh-huh. Yes. Yes. Yeah. <SEP> And it was all about women searching for themselves. And um you know a lot of hanky-panky going on. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for wh- when a lot of books like that were coming out I think. That's right. And so that makes real sense that that's um when it was written. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Um I haven't wasn't really aware that she had written anything for um adults. I was always just more aware of her jer- you know. Uh-huh. For her young people her books. <SEP> Yeah. And she's more famous for that. Uh-huh. But she has been writing for adults also. I'll be darned. <SEP> And so I thought hey I'll just try this you know and see what it was like. Yeah. It was very um. The style was very conversational. Uh-huh. <SEP> You would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> You know how that is. And um. Yeah. I wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything printed in print. Yeah. She has. Because I I remember seeing a new book by her that was out. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I think it was a it was an adult book. I'll be darned. So anyway. Yeah. <SEP> But that's the last thing I I've read. Yeah. And um. Well it's. I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't. Let's see I think I read oh. When I was on vacation um between semester break and summer you know on semester break between spring and summer. <SEP> Yeah. And I went to my mother's. I read a book that I have should have read when I was probably in high school. I read um JANE EYRE. I. No. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. JANE EYRE? No. No. No. No. It wasn't JANE EYRE. <SEP> WUTHERING HEIGHTS? No. It was um uh PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen. Oh yeah. <SEP> By Jane Austen. Yes. That's what it was. Yes. Yes. And um you know I I didn't know what to expect except I had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist. And she really was good. I mean I was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately. <SEP> Uh-huh. And um and you know I just. But I as I say I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then. Yeah. <SEP> Because I I think I was I think I read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college. Uh-huh. But I don't remember it. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and I got her the I got her someone. Uh-huh. I think it was um oh some actress reading it. Oh how interesting. <SEP> You know they had an abridged version of it on tape. Yeah. And so I got that for her. And she loved doing that. Oh I'll bet. Yeah. <SEP> But I remember that was the book. Yeah. And now I I mean I think it's around here somewhere. Right. I wouldn't be surprised. <SEP> I'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it. Yeah. Sure. Oh yeah. <SEP> But um. Well I read that. And then I'm trying to think um. Usually I try to to find something long that I'm going to. Uh-huh. When. If if I have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while um. <SEP> Yeah. Oh that's what I do too. Yeah. And that's about it because otherwise I'm reading so much for school. I'm um I have just started reading a book. Actually it's for school. But it's for um. There's a a literary jour-. Well not a literary journal. It's a it's kind of a journal of of the history of ideas that's that's starting to be published um from U T D. The first issue doesn't come out until next year. But um. Oh yeah. I'm doing some reviews of books just to what to sort of recommend to wh- whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal. <SEP> Oh how neat. And I've. Yeah. It's really neat because these are brand new books. And I just got a I got a th- this one. Oh great. Um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach. And it's a a a biography that is really interesting. <SEP> Oh great. Oh that's fascinating. I mean it it's fascinating. It really is. <SEP> Oh. Um but it's so long. I I don't really have the time to read the whole thing. But I think eventually I'll go back to it. Yeah. But it's it was written. <SEP> Yeah. I mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety-one. So it's a brand new book. Oh it's a brand new book. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that. Yeah. And he really this man really shed some light on um some aspects of of Bach's genius and and and you know the and more sociological things you know like the the idea that um that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything. <SEP> Yeah. I mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians. Yes. <SEP> Yeah. And they just went from generation probably to generation just with these with these all passing it from one to the other. Yeah. That's right. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. And um. Yeah. That's the way it was I'm sure back then. Yeah. So uh. <SEP> Yeah. Oh that's interesting. It was just really interesting. If that's you know that's kind of what. But I have to. Not only am am I re- reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisers for this um journal doesn't have right now doesn't have a really respected name um who's a uh a scholar on on music. Uh-huh. Um and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board. So. <SEP> Oh yeah. I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not. But. But at least I can tell them what I think. Wow that's rough. <SEP> That's real rough. So um it's real interesting. Yeah. <SEP> Well that's a neat thing to be involved in. Because I think our I think my alma mater um Gettysburg I think they were just starting a magazine that was similar to that. Yeah. It is. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I think that's probably a sort of a thing to do in small colleges. Yes. <SEP> Yeah. But um. That it. You know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh. Yeah. Because it attracts really a a lot people's interest. That's one way. It's really good public relations for small schools. <SEP> Oh yeah. I think so. Yeah. But uh another one of my projects this summer is actually it's part of my research assistantship is um it's helping a professor uh compile a bunch of translations of of various poems for a book that he's writing. And so I'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people. <SEP> Oh. Now translations what do you mean translations of of. Um well where where for instance um a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh I see. And the translations are all so different from one another. All different. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh that's interesting. So it's multiple translations of single works. And and that's right now right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as um. My work is just kind of compiling all that for him. Gosh. So. <SEP> That's great. It's real interesting. Boy you really lift me up to a different. <SEP> I mean here I I'm dealing with uh cleaning the stove. And. Oh well let me tell you There are days when I would be prefer really doing that. <SEP> You know I'm I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire. <SEP> That would be nice. I don't know if I've told you. But um this is not on the subject.
