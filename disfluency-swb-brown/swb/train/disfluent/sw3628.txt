What vacations have you been on that you like? Um well I really enjoyed um. I went to Mackinaw Island a few years back. Right. <SEP> It's in the middle of Michigan. And so that was nice. Uh-huh. I like um driving to different cities because of the scenery. So that was nice. So you. Most of yours is kind of driving. And. <SEP> Yeah. We've I've been all over the states except for pretty much east. Um it's very pretty driving like um up north in Wisconsin too. Um how how far do you usually end end up driving just. Um the furthest I drove was probably Texas. And then I've taken a train before to California. Now where you're from where? Oh Wisconsin. <SEP> Kenosha Wisconsin. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin. <SEP> Oh. So yeah. That's quite a ways. Yeah. It is. I've uh. We went to California this last year and uh liked it. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it was too crowded. Um. Walt Disney World and other places it's just the wrong time of the year to go. <SEP> Oh yeah. And uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's uh outrageously priced. Uh-huh. And uh kind of. You wonder if they're it's really worth it to pay uh thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in. <SEP> Yeah. But There's lots of fun places to see. Um. That's true. I think the scenery kind of. That's something do to you like to get up in mountains. Or. <SEP> Oh yeah. Uh-huh. Do you have any mountains nearby? No. Pretty flat isn't it? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Um I think uh the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. What vacation have you enjoyed the most? Uh um. Probably uh when we go to Wisconsin. Um it's pretty fun. There's a lot to do up there. It's pretty busy though. You have to like crowds you know. What is it? <SEP> Um oh it's a like a huge amusement park um they have water slides. Okay. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's just a big big tourist attraction. The downtown is all like little shops and candy shops. And it's it's really neat. I don't think uh hardly anybody lives there. Because it's just kind of like you know tourists. Probably a city in itself kind of like huh? Yeah. It's mostly a a summer summer place. Summer place. How far away is it? <SEP> Um from Kenosha it's about three hours. Huh. It's about a hour away from Madison. Okay. Sure. <SEP> Yeah. So that's nice. Sure. It's it's a pretty ride up there too. I really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin. It's really pretty. It's nice out there. Oh I like all the nature things there are to look at you know. Right. Well and you can probably. You're in a climate that's kind of humid. So you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things. Our our climate's real dry. <SEP> Where is that? And you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery. Most of most most of the land's pretty brown. You don't have as much of the greenery like you have. Oh. Where's that? Uh Idaho is where I live. And uh. <SEP> Yes. Okay. It's by uh. I have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that I'm on the phone. <SEP> It's by um Boise. You ever heard of Boise? Oh yeah. Yeah. And uh it's fine. It's nice. It's uh lot different kind of. I lived in Indiana for a while. And it's a real different uh land and scenery than there. It's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that. <SEP> Yeah. I think uh there's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern Utah the canyons canyon lands and Bryce Canyon. And oh boy they're gorgeous. <SEP> Yeah. Those are kind of fun places. We usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer which is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah. And the lake goes on forever. And that's real pretty over there too. Oh. But I think I'm kind of a summer vacationer. <SEP> Oh yeah. Me too uh. Me too. Unless I'm going somewhere warm for the winter. Right. Right. <SEP> Yeah. That'd be nice. Where'd you.
