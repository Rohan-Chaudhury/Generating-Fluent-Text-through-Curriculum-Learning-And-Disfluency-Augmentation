Do you live in Plano or work in Plano or both? Both. Both. Are you a T I -er? <SEP> Yes. Are you at work right now? Uh-huh. So am I. In building which building? <SEP> Well are you Summit or are you uh Spring Creek? I'm I'm I'm Spring Creek. <SEP> Oh this is fun. What building are you in? I'm building uh one. <SEP> Oh I'm building two. At least we found something different. That's. I've never had a call. Not like that. Neither have I. No. Isn't that funny? I usually get some place. I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called I think. Right. That's funny. <SEP> That is funny. So. So how's the build- how's the weather in building two? The weather in building two is cold. It's been cold. It's been cold in the building. Outside the building it's not bad. Typical T I or T I. Listen I got me doing it. Typical Texas Spring. Are you a native to Texas? No. No. I'm I'm a transplant. <SEP> From? From California. So what do you think of the Texas weather? Not as nice as California. <SEP> How long have you been here? Oh five years now. Oh okay. I've been here long en- pretty long. So. <SEP> You you you know about August then. Yes. Oh I've been through five of those. Okay. There's no surprises left. Right. Right. A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August for you know. If they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go. <SEP> Uh-huh. Good idea. <SEP> Real good idea. Yeah. We went up to Wyoming this last uh Summer during that time. And it was like you know eighty degrees up there. It was beautiful. Nice to get out of Texas for a while. We went to Alaska. Well that's that's the even even farther away. <SEP> That is really nice. It is so cool you wear a jacket you know. Even in the Summer time huh. Yeah. Or keep one handy. Because it's it rains a lot in Alaska. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Is that right? Uh it. They call it their liquid gold. Um. <SEP> But it you know. You get sunshine. And it's lovely. And then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green. And blooming. Green. Um. <SEP> Oh my goodness it's pretty. Right. Well Texas isn't bad. No. No. <SEP> Not in the Spring. Right. I have to think every year to try to remember what it was what's it supposed to like this time of year. Spring is nice. Yeah. Because March we usually get a lot of rain in March you know. It'll seem the news the Harold Taft you know on the local news. <SEP> Right. March we typically get a lot of rain. And we've had this many inches. And you know we're right on target you know. And just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March. But I. Oh we always we always do though. It's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like. <SEP> Yeah. Uh it. I wish I just wish it wouldn't come all at once. <SEP> That's right. And then we get all that heat. And and. Right. Right. Well it's just that you know. When it rains it rains. In California you get these nice lovely rains you know nothing really down- you know like downpours like you have here. <SEP> The other day we had some hail the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas. Oh really. Yeah. I live in Garland. <SEP> Oh you got into that bad stuff. Yeah. We got hail the size of marbles. I mean just so noisy hitting the house. And the glass on the windows. It didn't break anything. But we went out there afterwards. And there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn. Isn't that strange. I know I. You pick them up you know. And they're perfectly round. And I go gee how did they form you know so perfect like that. <SEP> I think that's one of the strange strange things. And you very seldom see it though. Right. Right. I've seen hail you know. But usually the size you know of uh tiny tiny pebbles. You know really small you know. But this was uh really large. So it had come it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently. Is that correct? Uh I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth. <SEP> I think I think that's. You don't think it's cold enough you know to. <SEP> It's not on the ground. But in the clouds it is. Right. Must be. I guess. And then I think you know all that falling would warm it up and melt it. But maybe that's what rounds it I don't know. But tumbling. <SEP> I was dumb. I was in um Florida for a week on business. Uh-huh. And I had called back to the house. I stayed the weekend. And I called back to the house. My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs said something to the effect of now we've made the national news don't get upset and don't worry. It's in Garland where all the bad weather is. I said Okay you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I watched the news. And I thought ha ha that's Garland that's not Plano. I don't have anything to worry about. I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in Garland. Felt so dumb. Um. <SEP> Finally I got home and found out my property was okay. Yeah. There was no problem with it. But I guess you just tend to think of of where your house is you know and nothing else. Right. <SEP> Right. And close to that what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's there's the hard rain. Oh oh I see. The creek overflows. And a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded. <SEP> Oh okay. The streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding. The house that house that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course. <SEP> Okay. Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through. Right. That's where I live close to that. <SEP> Oh really. Yeah. Uh uh not quite. I don't live in that Firewheel division. But I live close by there in north far north Garland. Is that a nice area? Yeah. They're supposed to. It's getting built up you know with more new new shopping centers and things. You know. It's a fairly new area. Yeah. And uh and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by by the next by ninety-three or ninety-four or something. A brand new mall not too far away from that area. <SEP> Well. So. The house that the house that I bought was really really nice. It'd be nice. <SEP> Uh-huh. In the Firewheel Estates there whatever. Yes. Yes. Uh-huh. <SEP> Really really nice home very pretty. Uh. Uh-huh. But you're not living there right now. No. I'm going to lease it. Oh I see. <SEP> It's it's investment property. I see. But it is really it's a very nice place. Uh I I would cheerfully live there. Of course it's not my home. And I've lived in my home in well almost ten years. And you know I've got everything just exactly like I want it. Right. <SEP> But if I were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards. It's a nice house. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's a nice area. Is it on the golf course? No. It's not. It's off the golf course. And I'll be honest with you. I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is. Is that right. <SEP> But it's in the estates that adjoin it. Yeah. Right. Right. Well that's a nice area. Yes. It is. That really is a nice area. When they get that highway finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick. <SEP> Yeah. That one nine that one ninety is just going to be the mo- the outer- outermost loop around. Right. Another belt line just uh farther out. <SEP> Right. Just continue to do that. Right. Right. Right. Where are you from in California? Southern California. <SEP> San Diego? I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was a ki- younger and L A area. And my parents live in Anaheim right now. Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area where the Cowboys have their training camp or used to anyway. I've been through all of that. Yeah. <SEP> Uh there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie strange looking area with boulders. I won-. They're not really hills. They're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation. Huh. I'm not familiar with what. Is it along the coast or or inland. <SEP> Uh. Well you know it may be a little bit more inland. That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen. Um. <SEP> Uh I had to go up to T I on business a couple years ago. Out there. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we went up that coastline. And I was just amazed how unusual that looks. Huh. Here hang on just a second. I've got a Los Angeles map. Let me just quick. Yeah. They have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles. Valley. <SEP> Valley. Yes. Okay. I know where that is. <SEP> Beyond Thousand Oaks. I know where Valley is. I've been out there before. Sure. You don't think that's strange looking. I didn't notice anything strange I guess about it. <SEP> Oh okay. Maybe maybe I'm used to Texas. Maybe Texas the way. <SEP> The elevation is extremely high. Uh-huh. It's got curving roads on it. But but the. It's just a strange landscape. There's very little vegetation. Huh. I didn't I don't remember seeing that part of it. I know Valley. Yeah. It's just a suburb of L A. <SEP> Right. It's a. And they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately. People can get in and out of L A easier. Maybe it's a place I went to. It was far extreme thought we'd never find the place. Huh. <SEP> It was interesting. Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way. Yeah. Sounds interesting. Right. <SEP> Right. Right. I I know exactly that area. It's a nice area out there. I love Thousand Oaks. Uh Texas I don't know. Thing things. You just have less a variety I guess. I think I don't think it's quite as green you know. It's green with all the trees and things out here. But it's just. Oh it's green sometime. Yeah. But it's just you know. I don't know. <SEP> Well it doesn't stay green you know. Right. The really. And in all honesty. I know this sounds like a Texas story. All honesty you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years. We haven't had a really bad one. Yeah. <SEP> I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one that had the heat wave. Oh. <SEP> It may be eighty-two because we bought our house in eighty-one. And we built a pool in eighty-two.
