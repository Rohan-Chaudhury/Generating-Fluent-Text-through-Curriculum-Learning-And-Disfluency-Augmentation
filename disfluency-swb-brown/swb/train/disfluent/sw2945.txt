Where are you from Tina? Um I'm from Maryland. And um I have one son who's almost sixteen months old. Are are you married or. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> You are. I have I have two children. I have a seven year old and a three year old. Oh. And uh so I try to spend as much time as possible with them. <SEP> That's good. Uh what kind of things do you do? Well um w- we do a lot of things with them you know. Ta- Taylor my youngest is. Or my oldest is in school. And so she has a lot of school programs and things like that. Oh. Ho- was it a big change in your life to uh have a child. <SEP> Oh yeah. Um yeah. It's really nice uh. My husband uh is working mo- you know most of the time. He's working long hours. But uh I'm staying home. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I'm just working a couple days a month. And um. Oh uh-huh. What do you do during those those days? <SEP> Um we spend a lot of time at the playground. And we go to the zoo. And we go. And we wa-. Well you said you said you worked a couple days a month though. Yeah. Yeah. What do what do you do? <SEP> I'm a nurse. Oh are you? So yeah. So it's it's it's real easy to work out my schedule you know to uh get in to to still stay in with that an and to have enough time to spend with Matthew. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> He he's uh just now really starting to to get interested in a lot of things. So um. Yeah. I understand that. Yeah. They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age. Yeah. But my my wife was uh. She worked part-time when my oldest was was little. And now she's staying home all the time. But uh that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children. <SEP> Oh yeah. You know to go from you know nothing you know. If you want to do something every night that's fine. But when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore. So. That's right. And I think a lot of people are um are turning to well I think I think a lot of people are realizing that. But still there are so many people that are you know have their careers first. And it's uh I think it's really hurting uh the kids you know. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> But. Yeah. I agree with you. I I I think that my wife leaned that way. And I'm really glad she did. And you know I'm glad she's staying home. But you know I know there are some days when she wi- she wishes she was back at work. I know. <SEP> That's why I like to to to work a couple days. I think it's uh it gives me a break. Yeah. Yeah. Well t- see that's that's why I'm glad my wife did too. 'cause she worked either two to thre- three days a week. And that got her out of the house. And yet she'd get to spend you know three or four days with. <SEP> Most of the time at home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so. Uh we had started out like that. And um I think that was really ideal uh. Yeah. I do to. I agree. But then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff. <SEP> It's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's difficult. But. Are are you from the Maryland area? <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm I've I've lived here forever. So. Really. Yeah. I me- I live in Germantown. And uh. Are you where are you from? Um uh I'm in Dallas Texas. <SEP> In Dallas. Oh. Yeah. So uh I'm I've lived here like eight years or so. My wife's from Fort Worth. Oh yea-. But. Yeah. I work for Texas Instruments. <SEP> Okay. Oh. So that explains. Yeah. That explains it doesn't it. Well um I don't know. I uh we we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> But uh as far as during the week it's it's usually uh you know just my son and I. And we're. Yeah. What's your husband do? Uh he he works for Coca Cola. Uh-huh. <SEP> So he uh he manages a plant out here. Oh. An and it takes a lot of time. Oh yeah. I'm sure it does. <SEP> But um it you know. We take walks and go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> But um. Yeah. What uh. My wife did some teaching at like uh like a private tutoring place. A Sylvan Learning Center this year. Oh. And so that that got me to sp- to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff you know'cause normally if if they need something they just go to mom. No matter what it is. <SEP> Oh. Yeah. I mean I cou- I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them. But it's so much easier to go to mom. <SEP> Right. I guess they get used to it. So. But you know we'd go to the library and do things like that. Yeah. But. <SEP> That's good. That's good. I know my husband was real uh. In the beginning when he uh he was transferred to a a larger plant. And he uh he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home. Uh-huh. And uh so it takes him a little bit of time. Oh yeah. <SEP> And I'm not able to work during the week uh because of that. He was I was working in the evening. Uh-huh. And he was coming home. And I I could go to work. But uh their relationship uh when I was able to work in the evenings uh really grew. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. He you know. Just the time that they were spending together. Yeah. <SEP> I think it it really it really helped to have that time together. Uh-huh. It really does. Because I think yu- you know you grow closer. Was your uh was your husband I mean naturally a child. I mean ha- had he been around children. Or. Uh oh yeah. He has uh he has seven other brothers and sisters. Oh. <SEP> And they have we have thirteen grand. Well his parents have thirteen grandchildren. Uh-huh. So it's uh you know there's a lot of kids in the family. And and he really enjoys it. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> But uh right now it's kind of a difficult time. But. Yeah. And and the cost of living here is just so tremendously you know outrageous. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Um it's difficult uh to do it any other way. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. I'm I you know. It's it's hard because you know. Then you're not getting to spend as much time with at home. I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to. <SEP> That's right. So yeah. That that's a tough situation. But then then again you know some. You got to do what you got to do you know to get along too. Yeah. So. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. At least I I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home. It uh. Uh-huh. We- well like I said my wife normally feels that way. There are days when uh I come home and she says here take these kids. I'm getting out. I know. So she's she's had about enough during those days. But. But for the most part I you know I've really feel like that's led. <SEP> I know. The way that you know we- jus-. Like what you said with the cost of living and everything I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And so I think that's le- tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially. Oh yeah. It has. And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about. But I don't know what. <SEP> I believe that too. And I think uh the kids are where they need to you know. Yeah. They need to really focus on the children in the wor- in this country. Yeah. Would would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think? <SEP> No. I didn't I didn't even really think about it that much I mean you know. Uh-huh. I I was aware vaguely aware of it. But um I didn't it wasn't really that important to me. And uh. Uh-huh. It's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child. <SEP> Oh it it really does. I. Just the whole uh you know. Seeing how you really are cre- are are forming this you know the mind. Uh-huh. Well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done. And you see you know everything I'm doing he's learning from. <SEP> That's right. And and you think if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care. Yeah. You know th- that's how they're developing their patterns. And I think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know. That's. <SEP> Or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide. Yeah. I I've seen a lot of people just say well you know he'll learn everything when he gets into uh you know. Yeah. Eventually. <SEP> Yeah. It's true. But it um. I I know. Even just this first year that I've been with uh my son h- here um he's. I can just see how much of of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Plus plus I think it becomes part of y- part of you too. I mean you get to stay home. I mean it's not just for him. But it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too I think. So. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. Well it's been nice talking to you. Well it's nice talking to you too. Okay. Good luck. <SEP> Okay. Okay. Good-bye.
