Now we're ready. Do you have a personal computer? We have one. You do in your home? <SEP> Yes. Yes ma'am. I do not have one in my home. I use one all day at work. But I don't have one at home. Do you wish you. Do you find you use it a lot? <SEP> I don't use it as much as my children and my husband do. My actually my husband and I are taking a class at our local junior college called micro micro computers one o one. And we're just touching on data base spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of you know different kinds of storage. And we're just kind of touching on a basic computer. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What kind do you have? <SEP> We have an I B M compatible. It's a Gateway brand that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well that sounds interesting. <SEP> Yeah. What kind of a computer do you use at work? I have a a P S one I B M type. Uh-huh. Uh and I use it all day at work. And I put all my personal stuff on it at work. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I really don't haven't had a need for one at home. But probably if I didn't have access to one all the time at work I'd want one at home. Right. I worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four years. Which was different. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. But I didn't. What is that tracing tracking the flights and things? <SEP> Right. Right. Uh. How long are we supposed to talk on this? They tell us when we're through. <SEP> Oh okay. Okay. This is This is my very first time. They come in and tell us. Have you just started doing this? Oh really? <SEP> Yes. They'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now. And it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that. Oh okay. It's not more than five min-. <SEP> Uh-oh. But I'm going to ignore that. That's a call on my other line. So I'm just going to ignore it. Oh okay. But. <SEP> Oh okay. That I have that too. It's kind of a hassle when you have this. But other times it. W- where do you work? I work at Texas Instruments. <SEP> Oh you do? Yes. Oh well of course. I sure do. <SEP> Of course. That's why you why you're making these calls right? Well no. I'm doing this at home. I'm already home for the day. Oh I see. Well this is a pretty good deal. I do it you know I can't do it at work. I I'm I work in the legal department. So I'm pretty busy. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I use my P C there mostly for creating legal documents. We use Word Perfect Lotus. Uh-huh. Uh. <SEP> Oh you do know Lotus huh? Oh that's great. That's something we want to learn. Yeah. It's really. I love Lotus. Oh. I think that's about my favorite. <SEP> I've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it. Uh-huh. That's great. It really is. And I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to do on it. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh you know you learn something every time you use it. I have a question. On this this thing that I'm this survey or whatever you know this I volunteered for. Uh-huh. <SEP> Do I start calling in myself. Or do I wait for people to call me? You can. Did they give you a number to call? Right. And eight hundred number. You can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you. But you can only make one call a day. <SEP> Oh only one a day. Yeah. If you've talked to someone like you're talking to me now and I place the call this counts as your call. Right. <SEP> Oh. So you can not make a call now until tomorrow. Oh I see. Okay. So then do you get the five bucks. Or do I? No. We both do. <SEP> Oh we both do. Well that's a. Didn't they ask you for your I D number when you answered? <SEP> Right. I had to put that in. Okay. So you both do. Well that's a pretty good deal. From what I understand. <SEP> So why why are we doing this? It's for research. Actually I'm doing this for somebody else but you know for a friend of mine. It's a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh. To uh. It's uh. <SEP> It's almost like that Like a voice command computer type thing oh. Well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. They're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on this. Now I don't know I don't know everything about it. <SEP> Well that's wonderful. But they uh try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this. And that way they can check voice patterns. I see. Different kinds of voices and things. Uh-huh. And get the computer where it recognizes voices. <SEP> Wonderful. See that's why I it's interesting because you have I I'm going to say you have an accent. Well I probably do because I've. And I and I think that I don't. I mean to you. But. <SEP> You know. Well I've been b- I was born and raised in Texas. Have lived here forever. So I probably do. And you're in what city? I'm in Richardson. It's right outside of Dallas. <SEP> Okay. My sister one of my sisters lives in Plano. Uh-huh. And that's right outside of. Well Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano. <SEP> How about that. I probably went through Richardson then. You probably did. And then I have a sister that lives in Austin. Uh-huh. <SEP> But. Well what are you doing way in Washington? Well we're actually all from Nebraska. They just are recently moved there. My brother-in-law is director of Admissions at the University of Texas in Dallas. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well that's interesting. Yeah. And then my sister works at the Air Force Base. Uh-huh. So I imagine they use personal computers. <SEP> Actually yes. They both have personal computers. Do they do their correspondence on it? Uh I think they just send Christmas letters on it. Uh-huh. <SEP> As far as I. Mostly my one sister uses hers for her children. You know children's games. Uh-huh.
