Okay. Wonderful touch tone telephone there. Uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading? <SEP> Uh haven't have I have a wide variety of of hobbies. Therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide. Um I get a charge out of uh TEXAS HIGHWAY which is uh very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh about the different areas of the co- of the of the state by reading it. Oh. Right. I've read that one too. I only had a subscription once. But my mother always gave me hers. And I I really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about Texas. <SEP> Oh yeah. It's it's uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things. It's pretty pretty neat. Um oh I like photography um magazines. I don't take a subscription or anything like that. Um things oh. Being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines. And and uh kind of strange because I it's not unusual to uh see uh an engineering manual or something laying around the house. Uh-huh. And then I'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it. But uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> How about yourself? Well um I have an interest in art. So I frequently purchase and read uh books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment. Oh that's great. And uh oh I guess I like a variety of things uh lots of fiction uh type books. Uh right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's fairly interesting. I bet that would be rather interesting. Uh that's uh self improvement. That's that's alwa- well that's kind of a hobby. But it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing uh. Yeah. I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement. How about you? <SEP> Um well I hate to. Yes. I do. We uh we have these classes we attend uh management classes. And and they give you books. And and the last book uh matter of fact I read was AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht. It talks about uh who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments. Yeah. <SEP> Uh one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is. Uh-huh. Uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is. And as you probably well know all of us are our own customer. You're my customer I'm your customer sort of thing. Right. <SEP> Um every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the uh in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Hagerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type. Which all you know betters yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well uh maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean they are. But I don't label it as such. Like what for example. Well I don't know um. I uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things. But uh they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. You know ge- getting your yourself in gear to uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it. <SEP> Sure. Sure. How about items like um THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER which used to be a big. Okay. Yes. <SEP> So those are self improvements. Sure. Um our supervisor uh subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW. By a man man named Doctor Bittel B I T T E L. Um. <SEP> And it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people. And the very last chapter and I haven't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers. So it's it's ver- it's interesting. Here again it's it's casual reading. And it's not eaten up with a lot of uh mechanical stuff. And it's really excellent fast reading. And uh but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know. I think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> If he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested. I don't know. I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King. That's a little little heavy for me. Yeah. They're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting. And of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies. But uh it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them. Yeah. <SEP> I have a hard time finishing books. Well I guess I also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work. Uh-huh. In quality especially now days uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the airways. Oh yeah. You could almost label everything quality in some sense or other. But uh I think sometimes the word is a little over used. <SEP> Exactly exactly right. But. Yeah we we have I think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what it is we're saying. I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk. And and all that kind of rolls in together there. Yeah. <SEP> But uh that's just kind of part of it. Okay. Well any other comments. Uh not that I can think of. Um I think I'm under my quota a little bit. I need to probably make a phone call or two. Well we just started. Right. <SEP> Uh this is true. I've enjoyed it. Well you too. And uh good-bye. Have a good day. Good-bye. <SEP> Bye-bye.
