Well uh and that's an idea that's been around for kicked around for a long time. I don't know that it's ever been seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that. But uh I believe Israel does that don't they for their. Uh yes. I think so. Uh. Wel- everybody has to do has to do something. <SEP> Yeah. I don't kn-. Or maybe maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone. But uh. Yeah. I believe that's right. Okay. <SEP> And uh and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about. No. I don't think it's it's necessa- n-. I think of that. It it couldn't be. Military service is not that much. But the m- military used to do it. But the idea that uh there are things that that do need to be done that could be done. And then uh country would benefit from one year from from everybody and even out the the uh requirement. Yeah. For for kids in high school it could be in the summertime. <SEP> Well now that's a thought. Yeah. Uh you know um it it could even be done while they're doing another job while they're doing you know a job to make money. Yeah. <SEP> But uh it's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it. I think the family would have to be involved in it. Uh-huh. <SEP> And people would have to be convinced that you know. I I think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving. Yeah. Right. And that's not the kind of society we have right now. Oh yeah. I'm afraid you're right there. But uh but uh anything like this that came up whether it. It quickly would be significant industry in in figuring out how to get around it where people. <SEP> There's lots and lots of volunteer programs. And uh but most of those are at l- least it it's my opinion that most of those involve adults. Adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire to to give. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> It's not uh you know it's not uh. Maybe the maybe it cou- uh. Younger people feel like it's not open to them. I don't know. But it should be if it's not. Yeah. Uh I suspect that the- yeah that that that that's not the thing. That they that they don't feel it's open to them. It's just that they uh are more self-centered if you will and not not considering a voluntary. Yeah. <SEP> It is kind of an introspective time of life. Yeah. But some schools some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to uh you know areas economically uh say less advantaged areas. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh they they promote service on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people. So at least that's a step in the right direction I guess. Yeah. Yeah. And uh now I didn- I don't know it di-. I I think you're right that that's not the not the way that the society these days is going. And I I think we need to we need to try to figure out some way to to turn that around that everybody. <SEP> It's really it's really unfortunate because when you do. I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association. Huh. And I have have done uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society. And there's there's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved. Yeah. <SEP> Uh it's it's really a gift to yourself. And and that's I think that's a really important lesson to learn. Yeah. And and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy you know. Well that could be. <SEP> Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you're just kind of down the tube you know. Yeah. Right. Uh it really is better to give then to receive. Yeah. I I agree with that. And uh and I I I don't know what what has what has set it off or what. But i- it it certainly seems to me that that uh uh things in in the last twenty-three years uh things hav- have definitely gone towards uh very much the concentration on self and and loss of loss of perspective in terms.
