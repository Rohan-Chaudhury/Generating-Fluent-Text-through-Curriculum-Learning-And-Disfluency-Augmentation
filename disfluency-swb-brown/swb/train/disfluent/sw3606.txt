What are your favorite shows? Well I it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much T V. But the ones that are out now. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I've watched that SISTERS a couple of times. I think that's kind of a good show. I've never seen that. Haven't you? Huh-uh. <SEP> Oh. I like that one. And um I'm trying to think. I I don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch. How about you? Um I like L A LAW not because it's realistic but it's entertaining. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. Uh-huh. I do like that. Um. <SEP> Yeah. Occasionally I'll see that one. Let's see. I watch CHEERS sometimes. And mostly just movies when there's a good movie on. Do you? <SEP> Uh-huh. Actually when there isn't a good movie on too. Oh. I just like to have the T V on if you know if I'm home alone or something. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. Have. Either the radio or the T V -s got to be on the whole time. <SEP> Yeah. Uh oh I do. I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately. Oh really. I've well I've been home with a um. I have a baby. And and so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much. Uh-huh. <SEP> And so I'll I'll watch a soap occasionally. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Do you watch any of those? I well I don't because I work all day. Uh-huh. But um I pro-. I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days like you know around Christmas or whatever. After a while I'll start watching it. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then on. For a while I'll ask people if they know what happened. Oh. And then I'll just forget it. <SEP> What what ones do you get into? Uh I don't even remember. The last time I watched was back in college. It was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something. Oh uh-huh. And I maybe watched it for a week. <SEP> Oh. But um I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the you know. They wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera. How funny. Oh yeah. It was a. <SEP> Oh I don't get into them that much. When I'm home sometimes in the day I'll I'll watch them. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But yeah oh I was really trying to think. I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch or else. Well you said you have kids. How old? <SEP> Oh I have a six year old. And I have a um. He'll be a year old in January. So you're you aren't a SESAME STREET fan? Well they do they watch it. <SEP> My six year old's kind of. He's outgrown that one a little bit. But but I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby. Uh-huh. And he's kind of he's entertained by it. Uh-huh. <SEP> So yes. I I do watch that one. Supposed to be a great babysitter. Yeah. Well they're not entertained for too long with it. He's he's still too little. <SEP> But yeah. Yeah. I do turn that on. Um. <SEP> And I I do like um DONAHUE. Uh-huh. Sometimes I watch that. I think he has some interesting things on it. I know. What time is that on. I never see it? <SEP> Um that's on at let's see it's on at four. Oh okay. I'm not home then. That's why I don't see it. Yeah. I'll watch that occasionally. He's got some real. I don't know. There's some real weird people that he seems to come up with. <SEP> Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange? Yes. Yeah. Oh yeah. He does have some real bizarre things I think. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> So other than that I don't know. What's that? Guess I'm not much of a T V person really. Yeah. Well I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us. But. Well tell me. Is it snowing up there? <SEP> Um no. No. It snowed a little bit um probably about four days ago. Uh-huh. <SEP> And they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas. Wow. But do you have snow on the ground now? Yeah. Oh. <SEP> There is snow on the ground. Well that's nice. I I wish it would snow a little bit more. I've heard it's raining there. Oh gosh. We've broken all sorts of records. <SEP> Oh really. They've got. I mean we still have some highways closed. And it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago. Oh my goodness. But um oh just phenomenal. I mean I you know. You see it on the news all the time. But until you've really seen it it does- it doesn't really hit you. <SEP> Yeah. But I was driving home from work Friday. And I saw there were some stop signs I mean submerged up to the writing on the stop sign. And that was just. Oh goodness. It was amazing to me. <SEP> Oh gee. So. So. So there has been some flooding. And. Oh there's been a lot. Yeah. <SEP> It's it's too bad. But you know the thing is that this happens. In the last three years it's happened at least once a year if not twice. But the people continue to move back in the flood zones. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh gee. So I don't know. I mean you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for. Yeah. I don't think I would. <SEP> Oh boy. Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood. Yeah. Oh what a mess. Yeah. <SEP> Well now do you work for T I? Yeah. I do. Yeah. Oh uh-huh. Huh. Well this has been an interesting thing to do. Have you made a lot of calls. Or. <SEP> Um I've I've probably talked maybe to five people. Uh-huh. My husband is doing it too. And he's talked to a few more than me. Oh. <SEP> And but it's been real interesting and kind of fun. Do you get paid for these? Um five dollars. Five dollars a call? <SEP> Uh-huh. Gosh. I wish I could do that. Uh don't you have to do it as part of its. We can't get paid for it. <SEP> Don't you have to do it.
