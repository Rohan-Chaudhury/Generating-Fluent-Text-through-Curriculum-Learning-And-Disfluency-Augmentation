Well I um run a business out of my home. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever I want to do with the kids then whenever I have a meeting with a client I'll put a suit on. And then come home and get back into regular clothes again. Yes. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um you know there's real no no real dress code where I work. Um you see people wearing you know all different attire. I um don't like to wear heels that really tires me out. I work in a big building. Yeah. So I predominantly wear flat shoes. Um you know in the winter I wear sweaters. In summer I you know I like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that. I've recently um tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that I can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot. <SEP> Right. Right. That's helped me a lot with having. I can only have a a limited wardrobe since I'm only working part-time right now. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um but still it gives it some variety. Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Right. Accessories. Uh-huh. What about your casual wear? Do you like to wear jeans most of the time? <SEP> Um yeah. Mostly. I mean at home I predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also. Yeah.

They're like black corduroy Ber- Bermuda shorts. Yeah. <SEP> And sometimes I wear a blazer with them. And I get really a lot of compliments on them. Um where I work is predominantly male. Yeah. So you know they. Their attire is always the same you know. Suits or slacks you know jeans whatever. <SEP> Yeah. But. And um but I'm really the only woman I guess at work that does that. But seems to work for me. Yeah. But. <SEP> In fact I just bought I I just got a new outfit as a gift that um. It's one of those skorts. You know th-. It's shorts but it looks like a skirt. Uh-huh.
