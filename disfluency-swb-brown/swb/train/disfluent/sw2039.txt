Okay uh. My favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE. And it has been for a long time. But I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it. Do you by any chance? Oh yes. You do !. <SEP> Yes. Very much. Well wouldn't you know. As a matter of fact I prefer public television. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I have particularly enjoy the English comedies and the English mysteries. Yeah. Yeah. I watch mysteries too. Is that what you're referring to? <SEP> Yes. Okay. Yeah. That is good. I like uh. Do you read? Vociferously. Okay. Well that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books. <SEP> Yes. And the plots are more um challenging you know than the sitcoms of regular T V. Well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television. Yeah. <SEP> I'm I'm not a great television watcher in any respect. But uh the watching. What I do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television. Any kind of. I also uh am very fond of great performances in that regard. Uh-huh. Yeah. Me too. <SEP> But uh. Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF? No. Oh that was a scream. <SEP> No. No. As a matter of fact uh Turner Broadcasting has been uh broadcasting all of the James Bond movies every night this week. Uh-huh. Really. <SEP> So I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week. I used to like him too. He was my hero. In fact I like Sean Connery to this day. <SEP> Well they're showing uh LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment. Yeah. And it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven. Yeah. <SEP> So. Oh he can never cut it. No. No. That's true. I was just thinking that today he did well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He does. <SEP> Whereas uh Sean Connery has maintained the uh how would you uh ruddy look. But uh Oh yes. Uh-huh. Yeah. I liked his accent too. And he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented. And he still comes off great. <SEP> Well you know he was when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something. He is. Yeah. He had my vote double. <SEP> I mean the man is sixty-two years old. I don't care. But uh but otherwise you know we. Uh with P B S and so forth. And I I particularly enjoy I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on P B S but uh the series uh YES MINISTER? Yeah. <SEP> Oh what's that about? That was about a the Interior Minister. It was a comedy. Oh yeah. Yeah. <SEP> The Interior Minister of in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Right. I I've seen it several times. It's a scream. But I have to go to bed. I have to get up and and work the next morning. I wish they'd put those. That's why I say did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF. It came on after DOCTOR WHO on Saturday nights here at least. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it should. Of course I li-. Really it was. I don't think they should show it during prime time. But still it was funny. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I know. Well I I I'm not much of a television watcher. I I read as I said and uh quite a bit. Uh-huh. I read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff. Yeah. <SEP> What what do you do? What kind of work do you do? I'm a Payroll Clerk. Just an accounting clerk. At T I? No uh. I have a friend who works for T I. And I work for a tire service here in. <SEP> Oh I see. I'm from Dallas. Uh-huh. Well the last two people who have called both worked for T I. And I just wondered. Yeah. Yeah. It could be T I -ers I think probably are participating more than anybody else. But I needed the money. This is five bucks here. <SEP> I think that's something we all ca-. Yeah. Really. Do you work for T I? No. No. I work for G T E. In Maryland. Really? <SEP> Yes. How did you hear. Oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we? I guess not. <SEP> How did I hear about it? Well I work you know. They are gathering a data base for voice processing. Uh-huh. And that's my field of work also. Oh !. <SEP> So I I know the people at T I who are doing this. And I heard about it. So I called them and asked if I could participate. And uh You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth. Oh. Right. <SEP> We could go back to television shows. Well you know speaking of public TV have you caught any of this series on the Bible? Yes. I have. I've heard that it's really against the well I mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true. <SEP> Well no. That's uh. You could interpret it that way. Uh-huh. Uh I I think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth. But the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was is it the King James Version when the committee did it wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in Greek. Yeah. <SEP> Well for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love. Right. Okay. So you can have. There's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know uh love of your father and that sort of thing. So in as to those types of interpretations uh really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it's at. Uh-huh. <SEP> So that's you know. You can look at it as though they are saying it's not true. But there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh the histories that are were developed around that time that are available. To deny that at least the majority of it is true. Yeah. So you know it depends on how you look at it. Yeah. <SEP> You can look at it you know. If you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true then you can very much look at it that way. I guess if you're looking for that you're. Yeah. Well Well you can interpret that the what the T V show in the same way that you can interpret the Bible. That uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. Really. <SEP> But uh as as far as that goes I we at least agree on what we enjoy. Yeah. That's right. But uh I don't know if there is there is a time limit on this so uh. Yeah. <SEP> Surely we've made it. I think so too. Let's just. It's been very pleasant talking to you. It was very nice talking to you. <SEP> And have a good evening. You too. Good night !. Bye-bye.
