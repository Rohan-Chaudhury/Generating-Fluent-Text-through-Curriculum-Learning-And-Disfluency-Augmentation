Hi. Hi uh. As a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend I uh took on a painting project in my bathroom. And I had wallpaper up. I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that. And it took me all weekend. Because uh the wallpaper getting it off I had to wet the walls down. And that had to dry. And then the spackling had to dry a day. And then the painting took another day. You didn't try re- rewallpapering? You just uh. <SEP> No. I I just painted. Did you use a textured paint. Or. Uh no. Actually the wall behind the paper was smooth. So I just used a like a semigloss. Um. <SEP> And. Well did you get good results? Well no. Not really. I need to. It it looks so bad you can see where those spackling marks were. <SEP> Yeah. I need to uh either paper back over it or do something. But it just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it? <SEP> Yeah. It covered the spots pretty good. But it didn't excuse me it didn't uh uh it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to. Well we did a uh. We moved oh last August. And we're getting a house. My house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den. And we decided. We went to I've forgotten one of the paint stores. And they just said oh you can get by. And I forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark. Uh-huh. Well more or less. After about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable. But it kept. The the dark. It was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it was smooth. And uh and we would we put this stuff on. And and it supposedly textured it or did something to it. And but because of the b- dark behind it it was really hard to cover. And. Was it like a primer? Yeah. It was something like that although we sort of when we got through I wished we hadn't done it. Because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it. And we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it. And it it really was you know. The advice they give you is uh. The job was considerably tougher than we thought. <SEP> Yeah. Uh particularly when you try to. I was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood panelling. And uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate. And it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot panelling. And the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something. Oh my goodness. That's an awful lot. Have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted? <SEP> Not inside. Now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it. That was one of the requirements from you know F H A that the house be painted before we bought it. Yeah. And it was fairly reasonable. We have a brick house. But all the trim around the house was uh. Yeah. <SEP> If I remember right it was like five hundred dollars. Oh that's quite reasonable. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> So that wasn't too bad. Um problem i-. Have you have you tried matching paint lately? No. I haven't. My wife. We we built a shed over the long way. Actually it took. This is not on the topic. But I did finish it. But my wife went to the uh Home Depot I think it was and and took a uh a copy took a piece of brick. <SEP> Uh-huh. And she wanted to paint the shed. It's it's a wooden shed uh. And she took it. And they've got this machine that matches the color of paint. Uh-huh. And uh they got. And uh and in fact she put some right ba-. She got. They mixed uh a gallon of it. And uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh. And it does it uh oh electronically some something magic. <SEP> Oh. So they did do a good job? Yeah. You know they. But it's electronic. <SEP> Yeah. Uh you put your sample under this thing. And it looks at it in- and uh and determines the. And it it's really remarkable. Uh the problem they had. And then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim. Uh-huh. And uh but they didn't didn't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample um from. <SEP> Uh-huh. I forgotten. This is Sherwin Williams Paint or something. But anyway. It's it's remarkable. That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know. You want this you want this to look like this. And you want that to look like that. And of course if it's all white you're all right. Uh-huh. But when you start getting into colors. Have you had problems getting colors to match? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. As a matter of fact uh what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh a blue. And the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn't match you know. Um. So. <SEP> It's the very same type of paint and everything. Gosh. So. So you. So what's your. What's the solution then? <SEP> Oh I have no idea. I repainted the whole thing. Oh my. Well at least you'll get very good at it right? <SEP> Yeah. You could go back and and paint the whole thing over. Yeah. That's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting. Because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do. I'll just do a little bit here and a little there. <SEP> Yeah. Although the uh. It's uh it. We almost one day. We painted the house to uh. We painted we painted the whole inside. And it had all this dark trim. We thought uh you know. We did the one wall but the other trim. I'm trying to think. I think I think we left most of it because it gets to be uh. They don't do that in the newer houses now. We don't. Yeah. The mold everything is white. <SEP> In a new house everything is white. White. Yeah. That's what we're trying to get ours to look like. Oh good luck. We wound up selling the house. <SEP> Yeah. Actually I I don't know whether it made. Actually it does. It's interesting that the white um makes the rooms look bigger. One of the. In our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames I don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls you know up a couple of feet. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue. Oh I see. And uh it makes the room look remarkably smaller. <SEP> Huh. She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color? The trim is still white. <SEP> Okay. The the molding. White. <SEP> Uh-huh. But by. And she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive. Yeah. But it makes the room look smaller which is uh uh which is. <SEP> Yeah. It explains why they why they have everything white. But I you wouldn't think that I. <SEP> Yeah. Well maybe maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff. Yeah. But. <SEP> Well uh what about the lighting? Did it make a big difference? Uh not particularly. Because the house has so many windows. Oh uh-huh. Uh it has. The the the living room has four uh good size windows. And uh well of course at night. But with the. We have we have a soccer field that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the lights shine right at our house. It's kind of. We didn't know that when we bought the house. But. So that uh. You get some. The color doesn't really matter for because you have that light. Yeah. We have a lot of light. Yeah. And well it it it um well it's just uh I think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet. And then above that we left it white. So. Anyway it didn't it didn't change. <SEP> I see. But the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away. It didn't. It kind of bled under the masking tape which I guess is probably the topic we're we're really on to that that the masking is. Uh-huh. You have to do that very very carefully. <SEP> And it takes a long time. That's right. You can work yourself to death. Well I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend. Yeah. Really. No kidding. It's kind of frustrating. <SEP> It is. A lot of work. A lot of work. Well I've got to go to a meeting. It's been good talking to you. Nice talking to you. Okay. Good-bye. <SEP> Bye.
