Okay. Yeah. Well considering you moved here from California I guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there. <SEP> Yeah. We have uh in California. I'm in c- I lived in central California. We have rain couple times a year. And other than that you know it would be maybe October and then in the spring. And then other than that there wouldn't be any rain. So. Especially the last few years. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it uh. Yeah. There has. So here I know that uh last year there was some ice storms while I was out of the state. And I'm glad to see there haven't been any this year. Yet. <SEP> Yeah. Yet. Still could come. Huh. Generally if we're going to get them it's not going to happen uh prior to January one. Uh-huh. You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December. But usually the bitterest weather if we're going to have any comes in January and February. <SEP> Yeah. Um. Then by March things are getting warm again. So we really don't have as long a cold season I guess as people up north. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It's so hard to predict here. It's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before. Yeah. Lots of times. <SEP> Well today it's not bad out there. No. It's nice. I just came in from outside. Uh-huh. And it's it's really pretty. It's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I'm a I'm a scoutmaster. And so I wind up going out camping with uh a bunch of boys at one time. And so it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. So you do that even in January huh? Oh yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. We camp year round. Yeah oh. That's interesting. But uh It's uh it's definitely different. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then I guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right? <SEP> Yeah. I have. And they're not too pleasant. It gets so humid. To me it's humid here. People that I know that come from uh like Georgia or North Carolina Yeah they say it's. Oh it is. <SEP> It's not as humid. As Houston say or Atlanta. <SEP> But it But more humid than Arizona. Yeah. <SEP> But I find it. And California for the most part. Right. Were you northern California? <SEP> I was central California. Central. Central valley. So that was Dry but pretty even climate wasn't it? Year round fairly Not wide fluctuations. <SEP> It's very dry there. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well it's pretty hot in the summer. It's in the usually you know. For a good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees. But it's a drier. <SEP> But it's a dry heat yeah. Hundred when you have a hundred here everybody's dying. Uh-huh. Yeah. I know. Well I lived in Africa for a couple years in Cameroon. Oh. <SEP> And that's a tropical climate. And it really feels similar to this during the summer. What types of What type what type of business takes you to those climates. Or was that just vacation or something? <SEP> No. I was uh working with uh I still work with Wycliff Bible Translators. Oh. It's an organization where we are looking to translate the BIBLE into languages of the world that aren't yet written. Not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages. <SEP> Right. Languages that don't have anything written yet. So this is like the first thing that's written down. Or you know first an alphabet is developed. Oh. And then uh. That's interesting. <SEP> So. You don't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you're thinking of things that people might be doing. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well it's based here. Uh the international headquarters for Wycliff Bible Translators is right here in in Dallas. So you're you're with the home office now. Yeah. Right now I am. That's what brought me here. Yeah. Well the uh I think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh. The weather you know does change fast. <SEP> Yeah. And things do happen severely a few times a year. But there's an awful lot of good weather too in between. Yeah. <SEP> I agree. I agree. I I thought the fall was really nice. Yeah. And usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too. After the last freeze. Uh-huh. And and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh I like that. Particularly if I'm going to be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that's nicer. Yeah. You probably do a lot of that with scout scouting. <SEP> Yeah. I do quite a bit of that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas. And it is a little more humid out there than it is here. So I guess we'll. Uh-huh. The only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains. <SEP> Uh-huh. There's not much between us and the North Pole. Yeah. And then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then.
