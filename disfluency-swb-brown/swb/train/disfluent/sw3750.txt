Yeah. Okay. So you enjoy camping? Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I uh like you I haven't done any in quite some time except for what I call living now which is which is very close to camping. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Is it? Uh-huh. Yeah. You know I uh camped in the Boy Scouts. And you know my dad and I went out sometimes. But uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress. Yeah. I mean when you have to have it you have got to have it. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know in those those kinds of situations uh room rent which is outrageous. Uh-huh. Yeah. So my buddy and I we just camped. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we figured what the hell. We did it when we were kids. And we loved it. Uh-huh. Of course we didn't really rough it that much. When when I was in high school. He is a couple years older than me. And uh he graduated and went off to college. And uh during the summer we would camp out at the lake. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove. Oh well. Yeah. You know I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh well it was fantastic. We would get up in the morning go skiing uh. That substituted for a shower. Uh-huh. And then we would go to work and uh come back to the uh you know boat house at night. And uh in the afternoon you know it is still four o'clock. You have got four hours of day light good skiing left. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh it was great. Yeah. But uh you know now all my life is more like camping than not camping really. <SEP> Uh-huh. Do you have electricity out there. Oh yeah. Yeah. You've got a phone obviously. Well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. We didn't have a phone. Uh-huh. They didn't have phone lines. You just couldn't get phones. <SEP> Yeah. And uh we are on the we are third from the end on the electric string. Uh-huh. So we are at the end of the mail route. <SEP> Yeah. Like I said we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas. Yeah. I guess so huh. But uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and I is we got a mobile home. One of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed And uh swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm in construction. And uh you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here you know putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know. Uh-huh. And uh I came home from work one Friday afternoon. And our truck was back. Everything we had was in boxes. And my wife said uh we're moving. <SEP> Uh. And I said where. And she said out to the trailer. And I said oh. She said yep. And I said okay. Uh. So we have been roughing it out here for about three years. But it is not bad. I we have color T V microwave you know. <SEP> Yeah. It is not horrible. But it's it's a lot like camping. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well I grew up in California in southe- in central California right in the valley. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains. And uh so my dad loved fishing and camping. So we would go up. First we went up just to uh with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our uh hot dogs by the fire or whatever. Sure. <SEP> But then later my mom and dad got a camper. So uh we have kind of moved up. Became civilized. Yeah. A little bit in the world. Yeah. My mom goes camping you know. She takes her uh motor home. You know she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning color T V microwave oven you know. <SEP> Yeah. She just. Roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. You know. Yeah. <SEP> But you know she has a lot of fun. Uh-huh. And mostly it is just a way to. She she goes to dog shows. <SEP> Uh-huh. See she shows dogs. And uh you can sneak a dog into a motel. Uh-huh. But you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel. <SEP> No. So she uh you know takes the motor home. And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing. Uh-huh. And she. If he would buy her a motor home. <SEP> So he did. Yeah. But as far as camping my wife and I have plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the uh you know Highway One there in California uh as soon as we get this house finished. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh that's uh That will be pretty. I am going to need a vacation. <SEP> That's really pretty out there. There are a lot of nice places.
