Hi. This is Donna Donahue. Hi Donna. Hi. <SEP> Ready to get started? Uh yeah. I think so. Okay. Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here. Okay. Well what did you have for lunch? <SEP> Oh it was uh it was. I'm an officer in the Air Force. Oh. And we went to the Officers' Club for a little Mexican food. Today. Yeah. Oh. Well that's interesting. <SEP> Okay. So our topic is is food today. Is that. Yeah. Okay. <SEP> If you're having a dinner party what what would you serve? Okay uh. Do you want me to go first? Sure. Okay. If I was having a dinner party I would probably um have some um some uh um some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and um probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some uh uh salsa and chips around and peanuts. And then I would have um let's see. I usually have like a little theme when I have a dinner party. So. Um I would have maybe um say if it was like Greek night or something um maybe um on the barbecue we'd put uh cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek. And um like a shish kabob and um mushrooms and tomatoes and onions. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then we'd have um like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad. Uh-huh. And um let's see what else. Um maybe some rolls and um I guess some uh some rice or something like that. How does that sound? <SEP> Jeez. Well well when is the party here? Yeah. Um yeah. That would take some planning. But. I don't know. Being a being the bachelor here that I am I I don't think I'd I'd be a- b-. I mean it it's not a question of capability here to do something like that. It's just there's there's no motivation. That's right. <SEP> You know I want to I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that. But um. Well that sounds good too. I have um I have three kids. Uh-huh. So um when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs. And um usually we just have very plain kind of you know interesting not very interesting meals. Pizza and that all. <SEP> Uh-huh. So once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun. But it's not a not a regular thing. Yeah. Um Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes. <SEP> Yeah. Is that. It? Okay. Yeah. That's what they they are shooting for here. <SEP> Okay. Um let's see now. Wh-. Okay. So you would have a barbecue wouldn-. Well I live on a I live on a lake here. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh so it. And then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors. Oh sure. Like that's a little more a casual thing. But in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a a fireplace and a nice nice house and all that. So we sort of a really good place to do entertaining like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh that sounds wonderful. I just haven't uh really tried a whole lot. But uh I don't know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Let's see. I have had well one time I did have a dinner party. I served a uh uh. I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits and kind of southern uh southern food even though I'm up here in New York. Uh-huh. So. Oh you are in New York right now? <SEP> Yeah. Oh. I'm I'm in Texas. I didn't know this was all from all over the whole country. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh I see. <SEP> It is. It's. And I'm fr- originally from Long Island. Oh no kidding? Yes. And now where are you in New York? <SEP> Upstate. Oh upstate. Rome. In uh Griffins Air Force Base. Oh okay. <SEP> Oh okay. Is that where you you are originally from around there? Well I was born in Buffalo. Oh okay. <SEP> And uh been all over the place. Oh wow. That's interesting. Okay. Let's see. Um well I like to have um sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have um everybody bring something. Yeah. And that's real interesting because then you get different um different kinds of foods and new recipes. And um uh sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like. <SEP> Right. And get the recipe from them or whatever. And we are just getting interested in in Mexican food. Because here in Texas they have lots of really good Mexican restaurants. Uh-huh. And um we're we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could. <SEP> Sure. Do you know what a fajita is? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> I've been down to Texas a few times and uh had uh the pleasure of their good Mexican cuisine down there. Okay. Yes. <SEP> They have some delicious delicious things. And I um. Since I always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts. Uh-huh. And you boil them maybe like four chicken breasts. And you boil them until they are cooked. Maybe like thirty minutes. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then you debone them and and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled. And you take um s- little bit maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr- in a big frying pan. And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt.
