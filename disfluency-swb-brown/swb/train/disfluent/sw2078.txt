Here goes Sharon. Okay. Well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars? That's the only thing I found out tonight. <SEP> Oh you found that out tonight? Yeah. I haven't even heard that. That's great. I think he deserves every penny of it. Yeah. <SEP> But there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting. Well isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would. Oh yeah. Wonder because football. <SEP> And they play a lot they play a lot longer season too. And a lot more games right? Yeah. That's exactly right. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I think let's see. The teams that were there last year were see somebody from California. I don't even know who won the pennant last year. Beats me. I mean I know Yankees have won a lot games. Through the years. Yeah. <SEP> Not lately though. We have been talking about this. I tried to call earlier. Uh-huh. And we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from. Then I started cleaning. And I don't even know where I even put that paper. <SEP> Threw it away. Yeah. I was just cleaning and throwing. Oh gosh. Let's see. The teams that. I think the A's were in it last year. The Oakland A's and I think it was I don't think it was an all California baseball. Well have you ever played baseball? <SEP> I played softball. Well that's what I did when I was growing up. Yeah. That was fun. <SEP> Yeah. That's fun. That's a whole different sport. Uh-huh. Yeah. Let's see. But I think I think the Rangers need to go. And I think the Pirates will go. And uh let's see. Rangers have got a new guy this year. I don't even remember his name either. Do you ever go see the Rangers? <SEP> Every once in a while I I like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there not very many people out there. It's a lot more fun when you're not fighting a crowd. Yeah. I think it's fun. I like just looking at the billboards. Yeah. B-. Sometimes when I if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun. Yeah. It's nice at night. <SEP> Yeah. That's when I've been. It is. Well. <SEP> And do you know anything about that new stadium. Have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there? No. Yeah. That that huge. It's suppose to be a huge stadium. And it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it. And uh they're going to try to make it a real community center out there. Cou-. And you're going to be able to buy your. What was no wait about the liquor? <SEP> That's that's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play. Oh yeah. So you. And they're never going to let liquor in there. Well they're trying. <SEP> I know. But they try every year. And every year they get thrown out. It's so stupid because they let you take it in there. But they don't they don't allow you to sell it don't allow them to sell it there. Uh-huh. But uh that new stadium's going to be real nice. And I heard that there's uh that you can bid on that stadium. Last night on the news I heard that they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you. So. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> And it's going to go to the highest bidder. Oh. Well that's the way to do it. Yeah. So that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame. You hear that? That's my kids turning on their music. <SEP> Oh. Holly turn it down. I think it's the Bart man the Simpsons. Oh God. I stay away from them. I wish I could. <SEP> I bet you do. Well where are you? In Plano. Okay. I'm in Garland. <SEP> Oh you are? Yeah. My h- my husband teaches in Plano. Oh what's he teach? C V A E. <SEP> Uh-huh. So what do you do? I teach. But I teach for Dallas. Oh you do? For right now. I'm trying to get out. <SEP> Is that a tough system to be in? Uh-huh. Real hard? Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I would think it. I mean it's good because they they try new things you know. But it's like they'll try something. And then they throw it out and get something else you know. Yeah. And you get tired of that. <SEP> That's typical bureaucracy though. That's that's I think it's going to be any where you go. It's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones. Yeah. <SEP> I don't know. Sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad. Well but they can't be though. They don't have as much money. Yeah. Most of the time. <SEP> But the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes. Oh man in Dallas you don't even know who's in in administration. There's so many of them. You don't even know who to payoff huh? I mean somebody walks in the a classroom. And you don't know what they're there for you know when they're coming how long they're going to be. <SEP> Yeah. Oh how funny. You know it's just there they are. And they're writing the whole time. No communication whatsoever. No. I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything. <SEP> And I finally just got to where I go okay I'm Debbie Moore you know may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know. Yeah. Because you know you never know where they are going what they'll report. Or. <SEP> I know. And they'll tell you they've written something down. And you hope they're telling you the truth. And you never see it. No. Huh-uh. <SEP> That's got to be frustrating. Oh it is. How long you taught taught in Dallas schools? Uh this is my eleventh year. <SEP> Ugh that's about uh ten too many. No. Actually it's. Now my job's good much better than a lot because I'm Chapter One. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And all I do is teach reading all day long. <SEP> Oh. And it's just ten children at a time. Oh well that's not bad. No. It's good. And you've got a lot of federal money too. <SEP> But hasn't it changed a lot over the years? Teaching? Yeah. Oh yes. <SEP> Or working in the system. Yes. When I first started teaching I remember I went to my. And I said okay I want to see a curriculum guide you know. So I'll know what I'm suppose to teach. And they go we don't have one. We don't even know where one is. Oh God. And so I go okay I mean you just you did what you wanted to do. <SEP> How funny. And now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day what period. Yeah. You don't know which is you don't know which is worse. <SEP> Yeah. No. I know which is worse. Yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Being told what to do is worse. Uh-huh. <SEP> So how long are we suppose to talk for? Well you can talk for ten minutes. But you don't have to. Oh you can? Yeah. And no. If you talk to ten then they come ov- on and say oh you've extended your limit. And please say good-bye within the next five seconds. <SEP> Oh I haven't ever talked that long. Well you know I hadn't either till last night I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland Ohio. Uh-huh. And we started talking about gangs you know. <SEP> He lives in Cleveland? Yeah. Wow. And everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here. <SEP> Yeah. But she was real interesting. Huh. And then tonight this woman called. Have you taken any incoming calls? <SEP> Th- yours is my second one. Okay. So hers was the first one I got gotten. And uh and she was telling me all her problems you know. And it went over ten minutes. <SEP> Did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all? Well yeah. We did. But the topic was boring I thought. Oh. What would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party? <SEP> Oh gosh all the other. The one I talked about the other night was good. It was um about movies you know what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that. Oh yeah. I could go on and on about that. Me too because we go all the time. The guy I was talking to never goes. He was boy it sounds like you're really up on this. I said I see at least two a week. Ugh neat. <SEP> So that was real good to talk about that. Have you seen like uh SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? No. You've got to go see that. The last one I saw was DANCES OF THE WITH THE WOLVES WOLVES. <SEP> Yeah. We talked about that one too. And he he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long. But I. Oh I enjoyed it. I did too. I mean it was just more for my money. <SEP> Yeah. I didn't think it was too long at all. Uh he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch. Huh. The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. Uh-huh. <SEP> And how old are your kids? One is eight. And one is eleven. You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. It's it's not it's not too cool for kids. They usually pick their own. <SEP> I bet they do. You know they've got it all figured out. Yeah. They want to see all the horror movies. Well and Ninja Turtles. <SEP> Yeah. Ninja Turtles got to have those. But most of the time really we watch them on the video. Oh yeah. You brin-. That's. Don't you? Just massive rental. <SEP> Well heck that's a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show. Going to. I know. <SEP> Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one ni- one time. That's what we do especially when it's bad weather man just plug it in. Yeah. <SEP> Of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything decent. I know. It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though. And they're cheap. And nobody has got them yet. <SEP> That's true. Unbelievable. That's true. We saw um HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS tonight. Uh-huh. <SEP> It was okay. It was kind of slow. And I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know. It just it. I don't know. It one of those movies it's not going to be around long. It will be a dollar movie in no time. Do you read? Not very much. No. No? <SEP> I don't have the patience to read. See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night. Yeah. Oh my Mom and Dad read all the time. You saw FIELD OF DREAMS right a long time ago? <SEP> Yeah. Sure did. Well I was reading the book. And it's called SHOELESS JOE. Oh really? It was so wonderful. And then I was um I decided well I like this author. So I got a uh book of his short stories. And that's been real good. <SEP> Who is the is the author? Don't don't ask me. Oh. The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book. <SEP> Shoeless Joe. Was it like the movie? Yes. Okay. Quite a quite a bit. But you know in the movie the guy was black. <SEP> Right. He wasn't in the book. Huh. That's one difference. There really wasn't a lot of difference. <SEP> I didn't. See I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie. That's interesting. That was a good movie too. Well do you think we covered baseball? I think so. Okay. Well have a good night.
