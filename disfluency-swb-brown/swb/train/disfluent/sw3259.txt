Okay. I'll just go with you first. What kind of eating out do you enjoy? Okay. <SEP> Well I like dining out. Of course it means that I don't have to cook. Right. But um I'm a divorced woman. I have one child. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you know when when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants. Uh-huh. I don't I don't particularly. I think it's sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant. Do you go like home cooking like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria? <SEP> Um e- n- Not really. We go wh- more for the uh Chinese and Italian and stuff like that. Mexican stuff that I can't cook. Me too. <SEP> Uh-huh. Mexican. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh we do too. We do the same. Yeah. What are your favorite places? <SEP> Um well I like Chinese food. Uh-huh. Um there's a little place down on what is that? Coit Road um Chinese Pavilion or something. That is really good. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I like it. And um I do I do like Chinese buffets. Oh yeah. Well we go we've gone to August Moon. And we think that was real good. Uh-huh. But our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon. <SEP> Uh-huh. And those are excellent. They're really a nice place you could take someone to eat. Right. It's not the the rinky Chinese decorations. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it's a very elegant nice place to eat. Uh-huh. We go very very often we go out for fajitas. That's. My husband has just gotten stuck. <SEP> Oh. And we go to On the Border. And lots of places that have uh I think. Uh-huh. And some of those and get fajitas. And he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then uh last weekend we went out for Italian also. And for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread. Right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So we went to El Sorrento. <SEP> Ha-. Yeah. Have you ever um tried Pappasito's? It was fun. You know what? This is that's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church. And Bob pointed to it. And he said `` I keep hearing good things about that place. We're going to have to go. ''. <SEP> Oh it is delicious. That's what he. Tha-. In fact you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that. Uh-huh. So I guess we'll have to do it. <SEP> It's. You always stand in line when you go. That's what it that's what. But it's worth the wait. D MAGAZINE said that. It said there was always a line. <SEP> Uh-huh. But that's probably I mean that's a good that's a good sign. Uh-huh. And have you ever tried um the Macaroni Grill up on. Yes. We did. Now my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna. <SEP> Uh-huh. And most of those things were a little more northern Italy. Right. And they like just the traditional. They're not very. <SEP> Tha- th- they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type. Yes. They are. Exactly. Exactly. <SEP> Right. The place of the seventies. Yeah. Yeah. But my little girl likes uh Spaghetti Warehouse real well. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Most kids do. It's real entertaining for her. W-. Do you ever go for steak? Just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing. <SEP> Um not really. That's a steak is something that I cook at home. You know tha- that you grill out. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> And I really don't particularly um. Well I'm I'm real curious to try this one that has such commercials. The uh that Del Lincoln. And oh what is that guy's name? They do those real corny commercials. Huh. It's uh over there's one over there in Addison. I can't remember his name. Anyhow it's some. <SEP> Steak. Yeah. It's some famous steak place over in Addison. There's a there's a second one downtown. And they have these really corny radio commercials. Uh-huh. But the- but their steak is supposed to be wonderful. So I ha- I had not tried that. My husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it seems like I've been. W- we found those one time. And then they discontinued. It was over in Addison. Huh. And then they uh closed up. <SEP> Yes. So most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here. Right. I think that's what goes you know really goes right now in the in the Dallas area. <SEP> Uh-huh. Of course you know down next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know there's just a there's a different class of restaurants up there that I can't even touch. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well that's exactly true. That's right. <SEP> That's right. Yeah. That's right. You know it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there. That's e-. Yeah. That's right. <SEP> Uh-huh. But um. I had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown for prime rib. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I haven't been. We usually don't go for beef really anymore. Uh-huh. Where. We've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. Yeah. When when I go out it's it's normally to get um some specialty type of food. Uh-huh. <SEP> Besides you know because y- chicken and steaks and everything I grill at home. Uh-huh. I know. Well I understand. <SEP> And and really it's they're a lot better than what I get in the restaurant. That's right. And save you some money too. That's right. Well. <SEP> Saves you a little bit money. Now what is your what's your child's favorite place to eat? Um favorite place. Uh she has a lot. Taco Bell. Oh yeah. <SEP> They're easy. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. <SEP> That's right. Well mine enjoy that too. They like to go pretty much where we like to go. And they'll. Uh-huh. And then our favorite thing on Fridays we generally order pizza in. So not Pizza Inn but pizza to our house. <SEP> Right. Right. Uh-huh. So we've done. Well um is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it? <SEP> No. Not that I know of. I think we've I think it's come to an eye conclusion. So I'll talk with you later. Thank you. Uh-huh. Thank you. Bye-bye. <SEP> Bye-bye.
