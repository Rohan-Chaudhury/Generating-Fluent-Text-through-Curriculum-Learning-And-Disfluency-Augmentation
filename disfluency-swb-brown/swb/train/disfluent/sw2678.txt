Uh so Jack what type of music do you like? Well I like uh classical and uh sort of uh popular rock type music. Uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I enjoy classical too. I never really had listened to it till I I got married. Oh. And and my wife uh enjoys it. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I had never listened to it bef- till then. But now I listen to it well whenever she does. And even every once in a while I put it on myself you know. Yep. Um wh-. <SEP> Yeah. I I used to play the piano. And I like uh Bach and Um sort of the baroque music Handel and uh Vivaldi and those kinds of. Oh yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh yeah. See those those are really nice. I like those. Yep. Yep. Though I I couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says This is Bach you know. <SEP> Oh. Yep. Yep. Well I you know I don't I don't know all that much myself. I just I just know when I hear it that I like it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. That you w-. What you like. How about popular music? Yeah. Uh whatsever's on the radio is is usually okay with me. But um sometimes I have a hard time unders- you know hearing the words clearly if I'm in the car and there's noise and stuff. Um. Yeah. <SEP> So. It's mostly just the tunes. Yeah. I'm pretty much the same way. You know people always say Wow ! Th- the meanings of those words. <SEP> Yeah. I know. And I'm always meaning? There's wor- well you know. I just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know. <SEP> I know. I know. About the only thing I can remember after the song is over is the refrain. Right. Yeah. That whenever they say it two or three times. Yeah. Yeah. I'm the same way. Yeah. It's funny uh depending on where you live. I I I commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury which is two and a half hours away. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different you know. Uh-huh. When. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. Because Baltimore will play more uh what might be considered m- a little bit more progressive? Uh-huh. And as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town that's you know uh two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever uh in a real rural Balt- uh Maryland they it turns into ber- basically classic rock. <SEP> Yes? Yeah? And they don't you know. <SEP> Oldies or what? Yeah. Mostly oldies. Yeah. But classic rock you know with. If you know like when the Doors movie came out you know Doors was really on the radio there you know. Where you know you'd hear was- one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in Baltimore. <SEP> Uh-huh. But in Salisbury you woul- that's all you would hear was This is the Doors ! you know. Oh yeah. Yeah. So it was sort of a funny thing. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. There's a big variation among the country. I mean if you go down south country music and. Y-. Yes. That's. I'm starting to realize that. I never really thought about that much. But there is. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I never I never I didn't. So. I I lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore. And I didn't I never really noticed the difference when I moved to this area? <SEP> Uh-huh. I really didn't notice at all. It just seemed the same. Yeah. But when I went more rural you know that it really changed. <SEP> Yeah. So. Yeah. Chicago has a lot of good stations uh. Oh does it? Yeah. <SEP> Yes. Uh in fact they have they have a continuous news station which is nice if you're driving and you want to h-. Yeah. Now you don't have to wait till the hour mark. It's it's it's sort of constant. You just turn there. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh you get the latest news and everything. It's uh it's sort of like C N N you know. You turn on your T V. And it's on. Right. Yeah. Boy that would really be beneficial. So yeah. Because you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio. I never get it. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. You know and if you don't if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in the car all the time. Yep. <SEP> Yep. Yep. Yeah. That's pretty good. So. Yeah. I like to listen to tapes uh of music or or um stuff on a long trip. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And um now you can even get books on tape um. Yeah. Yeah. On fact my uh my grandmother does that a lot because she's blind. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or what- she's losing her sight or whatever. Yeah. But. Yeah. That of in. I can imagine you know if you're driving cross country you know uh listening to a story. <SEP> Uh-huh. S-. Lot of the classics are really on tape. Right. <SEP> Yep. Yep. Yeah. So that's a lot of fun. But. Yeah. That's that would be good. <SEP> Yep. Well we strayed a lot from music. Yeah. I guess so. Well. But I but I guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening. So as long you're listening. <SEP> Right. So. Right. Yep. But if you do if you do have to go something I guess we can just cut off. <SEP> Yep. Okay. Well Jack it was nice to talk to you. Yep. Nice talking to you Tom. A- and good luck. And I hope you get some more calls and make some more calls. <SEP> All right. Good. Bye. Thank you. Bye bye.
