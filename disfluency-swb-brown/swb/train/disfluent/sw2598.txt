Do you want to start? G-. Yeah. I'm trying to think what I've seen lately. I me- we-. Well we just finished watching uh TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape you know. Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES. Did you see the movie? <SEP> Yeah. We we've seen that. Yeah. Did you like it? Yeah. It was great. Have you seen it? I thought it was very well done. <SEP> Yeah. I um. How about GHOST? We we saw an we liked it. But you know I didn't think it was as good as all the uh hype was about it. Right. I feel the same way about that too. It was okay. <SEP> Yeah. I don-. I I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for uh best picture. No. No. And uh wh-. Let's see uh. The most recent ones that I've seen are those two GHOST and uh DANCES WITH WOLVES. But I rent uh uh videos. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. And so we just. You you watch many? <SEP> Uh it depends um you know it depends on wh-. Do you like the classics like uh GONE WITH THE WIND and uh you know the older movies. I'd like to see those. I keep you know um you know there's like three movies that I I keep telling myself that I should see one of these you know some day that I haven't seen you know that that are classics you know. Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE. Yeah. That was good. <SEP> And never seen I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND. I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies but in in you know a long time ago. Uh-huh. And uh like the MALTESE FALCON and all those uh uh. <SEP> Oh I I def-. We saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on on T V a couple of years ago. Yeah. That was good. Yeah. And I've I've alwa- I've been wanting to see all of it. But we just you know we walk into the video store. And we're like well why don't we go see this now. So. Yeah. Yeah. It's true. <SEP> But um I think-. One of the movies we saw recently we saw uh MISERY. Oh I didn't see that one. That was good um. Really. <SEP> Oh it was great. And it. You think you know for a Stephen you know it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory. But there's only one. Well there's a couple scenes at at the end there's there is you know some blood and everything. And there's one really bad scene where it's I mean there's not blood but it's pretty graphic. Yeah. <SEP> But it's um it's a really good movie um. Really. Is that the one where uh the guy gets captured by that women? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. <SEP> He's a writer. And um she's his biggest fan. And she's also a little a little on the nutso side. Yeah. Right. Uh-huh. Did you see PACIFIC HEIGHTS? <SEP> No. We haven't um. I saw that one. That one wasn't that great either. Oh it wasn't? Well I didn't think so. No. <SEP> Oka-. I I got. I heard like mixed reviews um of that. We s-. How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? That's that's on our list of things to see. I know. I I wanted to see. I I was curious if you had seen it. And that uh. <SEP> N-. Our big thing is um. You know mo- movie prices up here. I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters. Yeah. You know. So it's like. You know a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees. And then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape. That's us too. Yeah. Yeah. True. I know it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive. <SEP> Ye-. Well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was uh EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Oh really. Yeah. Have you seen that? No. <SEP> Oh it was great. Really. Yeah. It was. I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than ad-. <SEP> No. No. It's um it's an odd film. And it's really interesting that. I like the director a lot um a guy named Tim Burton. Uh-huh. Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE? Uh part of it. I I never really watched the whole thing. <SEP> Oh ok-. Oh se-. Yeah. Well if you if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. If you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Oh really. <SEP> Yeah. It's um. Burton's kind of uh e-. He's a very odd odd man. But he's. I think he's very interesting. And uh I liked those two movies of his a lot. Uh-huh. He did BATMAN also which you know. Yeah. That was pretty good though really. <SEP> It was good. But I mean he was um. When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies you know. Yeah. You see it for uh you know a couple of hours or an hour. And it really. There's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars and all the different stuff like that you know. <SEP> Oh yeah oh. Yeah. Who's your favorite actress or actor? <SEP> Um don't really know. I like Costner a lot. But uh I'm a big I'm a big baseball fan. Uh-huh. So you know after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS you know. Yeah. <SEP> Um although you know. That was good. I saw that movie too. That was very good. Which one? FIELD OF DREAMS. <SEP> Yeah. FIELD OF DREAMS was good. Um and I I think I liked the other movies he's done. NO WAY OUT was really good. And. Oh yeah. Yeah. Did you ever see SILVERADO? SILVERADO. Uh who who was that with? <SEP> Um let's see. Danny Glover Scott Glen Kevin Kline um Brian Dennehy Jeff Goldblum's in. Uh John Kreas is in it if you don't blink. That. The nam-. The the title sounds familiar. I'm trying to thi-. It was it was a big western. I mean I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you'd miss her. Uh it was. And I think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours. And and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out. Oh really. <SEP> Um but it was it was really good. Um. I I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I wo- I would remember I think in with him in it. Uh-huh. How about REVENGE. Did you see that with him? <SEP> No. I didn't. Is that any good? With uh Anthony Quinn. I thought it was. I like everything he's done so far. Oh okay. You know it's uh one of those movies that it's not a great movie. But it was okay. <SEP> Yeah. We were in the video store today. And somebody was recommending it to somebody. You know the the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else. Yeah. It was it was not a bad movie. Huh well I'll have to catch it one of these days. You sa-. You you said you seen NO WAY OUT? Yeah. That was excellent. <SEP> Yeah. That was very good. Um he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES too. Now that's another one I wanted to see. Tha-. In fact that was advertised not too long ago. Yeah. It was on um. Cable? <SEP> No. It was on one of the networks I think last weekend. Uh or two weeks ago. Okay. I know I saw yeah something about it. Yeah. I um I wish I I mean I'd seen it when when you know it was originally in the theaters. And um I saw it you know I saw part of it again. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean I like you know I like Costner. I like Sean Connery. And uh there's this one there's this one actor. It's really silly that I enjoy him a lot. But I I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in a guy named Charles Martin Smith. I don't know him. Um you've probably seen him. And just an. You know oh that's who the guy is. <SEP> Do you remember. Did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI? No. I I don't think so. Oh. Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN. Yes. <SEP> Okay. In STAR MAN he was the guy chasing after um Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen or Nancy Allen. Okay. Okay. You know w-. Short nerdy guy with glasses. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> He's he's just. I I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in. He was in the UNTOUCHABLES. He was the accountant. Oh oh I know who you mean. Yeah. He was in uh uh HONEY DO N'T SHRINK THE KIDS wasn't he? <SEP> No. No. You're thinking of Rick Moranis. He looks like Rick Moranis. But he's not. Oh okay. Se-. All right. Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of. But I have I've seen quite a few movies. I I enjoy them. I think that uh it's it's kind of like uh good entertainment. An uh an escape type of thing. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. How about some of the ads. Do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews? Do they influence you a lot. Uh a little of. E-. E-. A review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see. Yeah. Did you see GOODFELLAS? <SEP> No. It's o- uh. I want to see it. That wa- that was pretty good. Um and. Um we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also. But my my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I've never seen either of the first you know of the of the GODFATHER movies. So we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere. I was just going to say th- you should see those fi- uh first if you can. Yeah. If y- if you read the book it's uh even better. The book was excellent. <SEP> Oh okay. I haven't never read it. Yeah. And uh I was a little disappointed in the third on-. It's GODFATHER THREE. It was not bad. But I expected more I think. <SEP> Uh-huh. We just rented um a couple weeks ago a movie called THE FRESHMAN. With um. It's got Matthew Broderick in it and um uh Marlon Brando. And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER. Oh really. Um yeah. It's it's one of the reasons why you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately. Um but uh there's a bunch of scenes from uh uh from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school. <SEP> And uh in his classes they're using there's a bun- they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER. And then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing you know this Maf- you know this uh organized crime head. Uh-huh. So it's um it was it was a fun movie. How about Tom Cruise do you like his stuff? COCKTAILS. <SEP> Uh. Or uh. I liked RAINMAN. I thought I thought it was interesting that he was doing som-. Oh yeah. That was good. I liked RAINMAN too. <SEP> Yeah. Well I'm. Being from Baltimore of course I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since uh he he's you know he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies. Uh-huh. Um n-. Barry Levinson did um DINER and TINMAN and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore. Yeah. They sound familiar. I probably saw parts of those. You know a lot of times I'll wa- I'll start watching a movie. And I'm tired. And it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Next thing you know it's it's. Especially if there's commercial in it. Ye-. We-. And then the titles might sound familiar. But I really don't know what they're all about. <SEP> Ye-. Of the three of those DINER's probably the best. I mean they're they're all pretty good. But DINER is really worth seeing. Is that the one set in the fifties or sixties. Uh late fifties. Yeah. Late fifties. Yeah. I think I saw that one. <SEP> Okay. And uh. How about Meryl Streep.
