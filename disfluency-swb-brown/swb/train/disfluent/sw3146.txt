Okay. Hi Nancy. H-. <SEP> Well do you do a lot of dining out? No um. We don't although we enjoy it. Um we do it more when we have company come. Uh-huh. Um what about you? <SEP> Well we do s- some dining out. Um I I do a lot of cooking. So um mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and I. I we don't go out too often as a family um unless it's like a fast-food kind of thing. But um but we do enjoy dining out. One of our favorite places here in in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe. I don't know if you have you ever been there? I've heard of that. But I haven't been there. Um where about is that? <SEP> Um well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and uh. Oh okay. I I've been to Cafe Pacific. Have you? Th- now that's down in uh Highland Park. Right. <SEP> It's Highland Park Village. Did you like it? Yes. Uh. Oh I love it. Before we moved to the area my brother uh lived in Dallas for a number of years. <SEP> And we came up one time when my father was visiting. And we all ate there. Uh-huh. And oh their seafood was wonderful. <SEP> Oh it is it's fabulous. It really is a great place. Now where is the Atlantic Cafe? Atlantic Cafe is down on I believe it's on McKinney. Oh okay. <SEP> Um and o- originally the two the the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and th- the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe. And then they they separated. And the guy started Cafe Pacific. And I loved them both. I really do. I think they're wonderful. That's our favorite. You know what we'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is Houston's. Have you been there? No um. But I've heard that's really good too. And. It's wonderful. The only thing is you have to wait. You have you have to expect to wait at least an hour. Oh. <SEP> So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in. And a- as long as you know that it's okay. But they have I think one just about the best prime rib um anywhere in the area. Oh. Oh okay. <SEP> I love it. Uh-huh. And my husband really likes their ribs. So it's hysterical. We go in. And we sit there for an hour waiting to get in. And then we get there. And we don't even look at the menu. You know right away what you want. <SEP> I know right away what we what we want. Yeah. Yeah. Well we really enjoy prime rib too. And uh actually the the Steak And Ale out here uh we've gone to uh. My in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And uh the time we went the prime rib was really good. <SEP> Was it? Really? I've nev- I've I've been there for like you know lunch. Uh-huh. But I've never been there for dinner. And it was good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Oh that's great. That's great. Another nice place for for prime rib is Baby Doe's. Oh I've heard about that too. <SEP> Maxwell's nice. Have you been there? But no. We've uh I guess we eat out even less than I realize. And I didn't think we ate out very often. See !. Baby Doe's is nice. Oh. <SEP> And one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to uh is Lawry's. I've heard that's real good Lawry's Prime Rib? Yeah. Yes. I'd I had heard that too. Um. <SEP> I've I've never been there. But I've heard it's real good. Have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway? Oh okay. Yes. <SEP> Yes. Actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to. Uh they have real nice lunches. Have you have you been there for lunch? Or. Yes uh. <SEP> Yeah. Primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes. But uh during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that included the soup an- or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert. Really? <SEP> Really? And uh the. My husband and I like veal uh a lot. Uh-huh. And their veal dishes have been good. We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the. <SEP> The specials. Uh-huh. Have you ever been to Biffin's? Huh-. <SEP> I keep hearing about it. I keep hearing the advertisements of it. I. Yes. No. And and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful. I have not been over there. And I was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl. Right. And. <SEP> And uh I've I've not been there. I haven't either uh. One place. And I've only been there for lunch. But uh I went with a friend. And we met her husband um down on Greenville. Down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's. I've been there. Oh I we just we-. <SEP> That was nice. It was. And we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup. And Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup. And they did. It was wonderful. But uh and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert which was a chocolate sack. <SEP> I don't know if you tried. But or s-. Oh. <SEP> I've heard of it. Where where it's made. It's like it's like a. It's all chocolate like made like a paper bag. Yes !. And it's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something? It yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream. <SEP> Yeah. And it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry uh puree. <SEP> Oh. And and we shared one the three of us. Oh. And it was plenty because it was very rich. But uh I wished I'd had a camera. <SEP> Oh. It was beautiful. Oh I bet it was. I bet it was. Uh. <SEP> The last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day. And we took another friend with us. Oh. And uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves. And so we had they had uh like a berry assortment. It was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom. Oh. <SEP> And you know they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the. You know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it. Yes. Yeah. Oh. <SEP> And it was outstanding. It sounds wonderful. It was really really relatively simple. But oh it was good. It was really good. Well that's uh one of the things th- that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant. Uh I love fresh berries. And their their fruits are always exceptional. I don't I'm know. They must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market uh you can't find them like that. <SEP> You can't find them. Yeah. And. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know i- I'm originally from Connecticut. And uh I was home a few years ago. And my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner. And uh I was really amazed you know. The the restaurants up there were kind of quaint. You know they were real real pretty. But they lacked the service. And they lacked the at- the just the I don't know. The restaurants down here seem like they have uh. I guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good. Uh-huh. And I thought I would really miss that. I would too. Because well because we don't go out very often. <SEP> When we do go out um in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess. And uh it is it's a whole experience. Of course you want the food to be good. But the atmosphere and service I think are important uh too. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you know in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good. Yeah. Because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it. Um that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track. But it is wonderful. It's called Cafe Max. And it's at Plano Road and Campbell. They have the most wonderful salads. They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three. <SEP> Oh really?
