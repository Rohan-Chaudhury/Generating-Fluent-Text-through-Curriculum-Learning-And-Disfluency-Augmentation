Uh well uh to begin. I guess uh space is uh real important I think. So it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time I guess. So. Yeah. I I agree. Uh. <SEP> It's definitely new frontier stuff. So uh. But uh I'm not too up-to-date on the space on the space frontier. But uh I guess they're going going pretty far into it now. Um Star Wars is not too far I don't think. But uh. <SEP> I I I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time. Oh have you. Yeah. So what do you know about it. <SEP> Well actually I'm I I'm quite versed lately. I get on a computer network all the time. And people are talking about about the current space program all the time. They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that you know are just like science fiction you know. It's like they take off you know. And then they land with the with the you know. The afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad. Really. <SEP> Oh my gosh. Yeah. It's called V C X or something like that. Also called Delta Clipper which is a decent name for something like that. Wow. <SEP> Well I don't know. You think you'd you think you'd uh go up in space if you had a chance? Oh yeah. Do you. <SEP> I think I would. I think that'd be neat. I think I would just sitting here talking about it. But if the time came it'd be real nervous. I'd be scared. Scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster. That'd be pretty hairy. <SEP> Well you know I had a car uh uh a tire come off of a car. So you know I like I know what it's like to. Yeah. Imagine. Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home. Right. Right. So well I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now wherever. And opening up those stations whatever filling them. <SEP> Yeah. They're talking about doing that again too. Uh-huh. I don't know if we'll ever see that up there. <SEP> Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years. Oh really. Yeah. And they're going to put. That's all beyond my imagination really. <SEP> Yeah. But science fiction books. I mean you look at the Jetsons you know cartoon show and it's not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons. So you never know. Oh yeah. Yeah. Any of that stuff from the Jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would come become possible and now you we have a lot of those. So. <SEP> Uh-huh. So you never know what what may occur. But as far as me seeing it you know I don't know. Yeah. <SEP> I don't know. But I think it's real vital important for the future you know generations to come. Uh-huh. So. <SEP> Yeah. I uh. It's it's it's something definitely that uh you know. It's it's uh got the extra little oomph of interest. Yeah. Uh. I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too once it becomes you know like it's more possible. But when they start showing the drawings and all that I'm sure you know when they. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I wish uh. Like uh Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy uh a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it you know purely commercial. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they'd go up you know and do things. And. So did they scratch those uh that Star Wars deal you know they one we was all worried about Russia and all that? <SEP> Oh. No. It's still probably going. But I don't know whether it it research will go on. Yeah. But the economy the way it is all over they probably cut back on on that because it's not. <SEP> Oh yeah. Well they're they're going to be cutting back so much on just you know the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here. Right. <SEP> Yeah. I know. And then. But uh Russia's still going to have missiles. They're still going to be subs and things. Yeah. And we don't know who's handling them now. <SEP> Yeah. So that's a whole different story now. Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that Russia itself that was going to have them. Oh really. <SEP> At least that was you know that's what everybody says. Oh yeah. Yeah. We want only Russia to have them. Uh-huh. And now they're saying Yeah. Yeah. You're a republic. You don't want those. You don't want those. Some crazy hit man over there so with those little republican- republics or whatever. <SEP> They splitting it all up now. And one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it. Uh-huh. You never know. <SEP> But that the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev he's supposed to be he's supposed to be on our side isn't he. Pretty much. <SEP> One hopes. Uh-huh. I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects. So. <SEP> Uh-huh. But that way you can't never tell that. Yeah. Kiss some butt. But but uh. <SEP>
