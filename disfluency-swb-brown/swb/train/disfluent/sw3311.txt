Uh mainly just being with family is it. We just hang out. And my grandparents have a pool. So we go swimming. And uh. Pretty hot isn't it in the summer? Yeah. But we keep cool just by going swimming. And it's fun to be with my cousins. They're up there also my grandparents and my cousins. <SEP> That's good. Uh-huh. So. <SEP> Been to Hawaii? No. Have you? Yes. In fact I just got some reservations. I'm going to go for uh almost two weeks this winter. Oh my goodness. <SEP> Yes. It's the longest. Well actually I lived there. So I was there longer.

We're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way. Wow. <SEP> Yeah. So I think I would like to go to Arizona. I mean I was in Phoenix in January last January. But it was rainy and icky. Oh really? It was the coldest it's been there ever in January. I think. It's very cold. So do you travel a lot. <SEP> But I would like to go to Tempe. Or. Do we travel a lot? Uh some yeah. Well I've been a I was a travel agent. Oh. <SEP> I mean I have been up until just a few months ago. But I'm thinking of going back to work. Huh. Yeah. So you know a lot of good vacation spots huh. <SEP> I lo- I know a lot of good places to go. But you definitely need to go to Hawaii. Very definitely. That's your favorite? Yes. It is my favorite. My husband hasn't been to Europe yet. And I'd like to take him there. And but he's traveled all over the United States. And I haven't. Like I haven't been down south. I'd like to go to New Orleans. Have you been there? I haven't. Where where do you live? <SEP> We I live in Yakima Washington. Wow. So it's cold and rainy today. It's yucky. Um. <SEP> But we've had some pretty nice weather.

You think. I know. <SEP> So just you know. Don't don't be in any hurry. I'm not I'm not. You really should go to Europe. I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college. And that was just. I I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car. And I took the trip. And. And it was great? <SEP> Uh I traveled with a group of sixteen other students. Actually they there was two other graduating seniors besides myself. And we just had a ball. We stayed at. How long did you get to stay there? Uh six weeks. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. It was wonderful. So you should think about doing something like that. Uh-huh. I just had a friend that got back from Europe. And she was there like all winter semester.
