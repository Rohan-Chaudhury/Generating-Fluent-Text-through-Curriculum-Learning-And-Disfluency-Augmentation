Well uh let's see. What type of car do I want? Well I'd like to have a Corvette. Oh wow. But my uh weekly wages don't apply for me to have that kind of car. So. <SEP> Yeah. Uh I'm engaged to get married. So I'll more likely get a car for economic reasons. Right. Yeah. And uh so uh to drive back and forth to work is all I'll need a car for pretty much. And we have a truck. So probably a economic size car or uh. <SEP> What kind of a car do you have now? Right now I have a eighty-seven Cavalier. It's a piece of. My car is really old too. Because uh I drive out of town a lot of the weekends. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I would like my next car to have good gas mileage. Right. And uh same here uh. You know a nice car American made. And uh you know a a nice car but not too expensive. Because uh I couldn't afford like a brand new like Lamborghini. <SEP> I hardly drive. But while we're talking. Right. While we're talking my next car I'd like to be sporty and you know nice. Right. <SEP> But you know it's expensive. And then insurance is really high for that too. So Something with a that's not too sporty because of insurance then. Oh I know. Right. That insurance does come into play. I forgot about that. <SEP> Yeah. What kind of insurance do you have up there. Or is it real high up there? Uh no. Mine just got lowered because I just turned twenty-one. And uh I'm not sure really how much I pay. I just. My mom's helping me out you know because I'm a college I'm in college. And uh so I just give her the money and take her word for it. Right. <SEP> Right. I mean that insurance is high dollars. Yeah. Yeah. It is. So. But. <SEP> And the more expensive the car the higher it is. So Unless I win the lottery I won't be driving anything too expensive. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Right. I don't plan on buying a car for many many years. So. Right. Yeah. <SEP> I have to make this one last as long as I can. What's everybody drive up there? Uh in Kenosha? I mean in Wisconsin they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive. <SEP> Oh it just is. Or do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything? Yeah. We we have a Jeep with four wheel drive because uh because of the snow you mean. Or. Right. It never snows down here. So. <SEP> Well we don't have any snow here now. Really? It all melted. Yeah. There is no snow at all. We haven't had snow yet. We usually only get like once a year or so. <SEP> Huh. Kind of strange to you all huh? Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. It is. Because how. It's like seventy degrees here right now. Oh don't tell me that. Yep. How how cold is it there? <SEP> Well actually it's been warm. It's in the forties. Really? Yeah. And that's that's really warm. Huh. <SEP> Uh and it's supposed to rain tomorrow. So we. I've only seen snow once this year. And it was really bad. And then it all melted like within the week. Really? And now there is no snow. So. Huh. But um so what what is your dream car? <SEP> Uh I haven't really thought about it. I'm not too big on cars. I mean I don't know the names and stuff. But if I were to go to a car lot and like look at them I would pick out one that you know looked really nice. Uh-huh. What's your favorite color? <SEP> Uh for a car? Yeah. Probably blue. Like if it you know was just an average middle class car. Blue? <SEP> But if I were to get a sports car maybe white or red. Right. Right. Yeah. So what kind of car do you drive right now? <SEP> Uh it's a Sky Hawk Buick. Really? Eighty-three. I think. Really? <SEP> Yeah. Uh like eighty-two thousand miles. Really? Yeah. Oh. <SEP> I'm afraid it's not going to last me that long. And I hope it does though. Yeah. It's a two door. I like I like smaller cars. They're. I find them more comfortable to drive. Right. Does everybody have their windows tinted up there? <SEP> Uh no. I don't see too many cars tinted. Everybody has tinted down here. Oh I'm sure. Yeah. I could I could see why. So you been down here before? <SEP> Yep. Really? Uh. Did you like it? <SEP> It was busy. Yeah. It's different I bet huh. Yeah. <SEP> It was nice. I remember uh swimming on Easter day. And it was like really cold up here. But came back with a little tan. Right. So that was nice. It's like you know. Everybody freaks out when it sn-.
