Okay. So um how do think how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years? Uh I'm at a little bit of a loss. You know I don't know. Ten years ago. See I'm what I'm about uh twenty-eight now. So when I was eighteen. Uh-huh. <SEP> Things haven't changed a whole lot. Really. People are being a little more oh I don't know a little le- a little less bigoted in some ways. I don't know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Seems to me. Well. I guess I'm like my parents. The younger generation gets away with hell. But uh. Yeah. <SEP> Well it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted. But that may just be because I've changed. You know I used to live up north. Down here Dallas seems to me the police are militant. Really. But uh. Where'd you live up. Where'd you live at. <SEP> I lived in Akron Ohio. Oh did you? I'm from Illinois. So. Oh. How long how long you been in Dallas? <SEP> Oh about eight years. Oh really? In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets more and more gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. I think. Yeah uh. <SEP> You know uh as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do. Yeah. I think it's. Crime has gone got a lot worse in the last last ten fifteen years. Oh yeah. I agree. <SEP> And maybe that has a lot to do with it. Yeah. I I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse. And you know I I think there's. To me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values. Yeah. That's true. So. <SEP> That's true. But uh. I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved. Yeah. <SEP> But that's more a matter of. You know I'm no longer a teenager in high school. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be. And. <SEP> Hello. Somebody's at the door. So. Hang on just a second. Okay. <SEP> Okay. But uh I don't know. That's just that's one thing I see I see a lot more you know double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that I guess. Yeah. That's true. It's getting more and more expensive to live. Yeah. That's for sure. <SEP> You can't you can't make it. Yeah. Without it hardly. That's right. I guess when I was growing up it was it was still the ideal to get a get a home and buy house. And these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. You know you just don't buy a house. Just because they can't get into one. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. The ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways. <SEP> Yeah. So. Yeah. That's that's a good point. So I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years. Yeah. For me it's kind of hard. I don't know. I think. I don't know I think the middle class is shrinking and the uh lower class is expanding. Oh yeah. I agree. <SEP> And sooner or later there's going to there's going to be a turn around. Well I hope so you know at some point. But I don't know at what point. But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class uh. Yeah. <SEP> So usually is I think. Yeah. It's uh. <SEP> It's hard for me to say. I hope it happens because I'd be one of those that gets caught. But on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be be changed. Yeah. That's right. Do you work at T I? Yeah. Do you? <SEP> Yeah. What uh department do you work in? I'm in semiconductor. Are you? I'm in semiconductor division too. <SEP> Yeah. So. How long you been with them since you moved down here? About eight years. Yeah. Um I'm over at the Center One building. <SEP> Yeah. So am I. Are you really. What floor? Two. I'm on the seventh floor. <SEP> Well. How about that. Well it's a small world. So so let's see. Second floor you work with uh linear. Yeah. Do you. Do you uh do you know Alec Morton? <SEP> Yeah. I've probably seen him around. Oh you do huh. Well he comes up and pushes us around. So uh so I'm pretty familiar with. Are you D A D or something up there? Huh? <SEP> Are you D A D or something? Yeah. Yep. You must know him. His reputation precedes him. Yeah. Well seventh floor. Yeah. <SEP> T A D. Well uh he uh boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief. They they say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D -ers grief. So I can believe it. But. Well. Yeah. Let's see if you've been in Dallas eight years I guess that's about how long. I've been in here about eight years too I guess. Um been with T I like twelve. But I started out in Lubbock. <SEP> Lubbock is. I don't know. I guess if this is the only place you've lived Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas. Yeah. Flat dry and dirty. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. But the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too. I mean here in Dallas everything is just real rush rush. Yeah. I lived in the country for several years. And living in the city is a whole different uh social structure. Oh yeah. <SEP> But uh. Well I got some friends that uh. Seems like he went to school at like DeVry. Is there a DeVry in Akron? I don't even know. Oh. <SEP> I haven't been up there in years. Oh I see. Well he went to school somewhere in Ohio. And he's from that area. And uh he works over in the Park Park Central building I think. But uh I haven't talked to him in a while. But um yeah. He he misses it. He used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it. Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while. No. I haven't been back in fi- ten fifteen years. You still have relatives back there. Or. <SEP> Yeah. I do. I just haven't had a chance to get back. Oh. Catch them next year probably. Really. Well let's see. How how long are we supposed to talk here? <SEP> I don't know. I think we ran out of social social changes to talk about. So. Yeah. Well my kids are probably needing me to go. So. <SEP> Okay. All right. Well it's nice talking to you. Yeah. Talk to you later. <SEP> All righty. Bye. Bye.
