Okay. Do you subscribe to magazines yourself? I don't uh subscribe to any magazines at home because we get so many at work that uh I need to read that uh I just don't take any at home. Oh I see. I get uh MCCALL'S. Of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to re- go back to work. What I enjoy about staying home. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And uh I read magazines mainly because they're fast. And if I want to relax while I watch T V. Of course I'm one of those that does two things at once. And uh I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S. And I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject. <SEP> Right. I u- I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and uh several magazines like that a few years ago at at at home. Uh-huh. And then you stopped them all. But yeah. The subscriptions ran out. And I never renewed them. And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work to read them. I find that uh about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING. Uh-huh. GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when uh when I'm really have time and I really want to read something you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with uh on a general basis. Uh-huh. And we travel a lot. So I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know different ones. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. And I get into uh newspapers. So I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am. I'm re- read it fast and put it down. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. When when I had my magazines at home I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures you know. And if something caught my eye then I might read something. Right. But otherwise than that you know they were uh you know not too useful to me. You know. Well That's what I do. <SEP> I got some good recipes from them sometimes. But. You clip recipes. And you save them forever. And you never really use them. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's right. That's right. And then every so often you weed through them. And you think where did I ever put that recipe. Right. But uh that's mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this. <SEP> Uh-huh. I I subscribe like I said to a few. And once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands or something like that. Uh-huh. But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what uh pertains to my daily life at the present time. <SEP> Right. Well since I work with computers during my work I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything. And I have to read the magazines you know such as BYTE and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these uh magazines such as that. So I really you know just. I can see that it will be a very long time probably before I subscribe to any magazines at home. Right. Well sometimes if you know if you're in transportation in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. But I think. And the idea is to is and good. I can just dump them at the other end. And I don't have to carry them back with me. <SEP> That's right. I do that when we travel. I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we. Uh-huh. No matter what it is air travel or anything and I. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. If I if I go on an airplane ride or something I'll stop in and pick up a you know a COSMOPOLITAN or something to read on the airplane. Right. Al- although now. But uh you know that's basically just about. I'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then. That's when you really have time. Now see your computer ones. I got into computer work somewhat uh. We have our own computer system at home. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I tried uh reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it. And it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along. Uh-huh. It was you know kind of a little bit more than what I needed. So I never did get into them. I when I bought the computer all of a sudden I was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail. I think they all that- thought well we have a live one. She'll subscribe. <SEP> Uh-huh. But they were wrong. I never got into them. But but Okay? Right. All right I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point. <SEP> Okay. It was nice talking with you. It was nice to talk with you too. Okay. <SEP> Thank you. Uh-huh. Bye now. Bye-bye.
