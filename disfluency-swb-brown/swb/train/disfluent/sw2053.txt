Um what kind of hobbies do you have? Um I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when I do have spare time. Really. I like cross-stitch too. <SEP> Oh I love it. I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately. That's my case also. I've got a new born. And there's just no time. Uh-huh. <SEP> Have you been cross-stitching long? Oh several years. My husband is even interested in it now. He likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized. Oh really. <SEP> Mine sort of he looks at the pattern. And he says how do you get that from there to the material. Not that hard. Oh it's not. I really enjoy it. <SEP> And once you get started on it it's just oh I just I love it. Uh-huh. I do a lot of my own patterns also. Yeah. <SEP> In fact I did one BILL THE CAT you know from Glenn County that uh was a real good one to do. Oh yeah. It was tough. But uh yeah. Do you have any others. Or is this mainly cross-stitching? Um I do mostly that um. Not very artistic really for like painting and stuff. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. Um Yeah. But now I don't know. I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors. Oh really. Yeah. I've got the kits to put them all in. I don't have them all yet certainly. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I got to counting the other day. And uh I think I have what was it two hundred. And I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is uh. It yeah it can add up quick. Oh yeah. I just I just keep an inventory of what I currently have. And then when I start a new project I go through and see if I if I you know. Just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. I see. Well now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead you know what comes close. Because a lot of them are similar. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. A lot of times you can do that. I think I. The pinks there's like forty-two different shades of pink. Good grief. Yeah. There's lots of pinks and greens. Pinks and greens. Yeah. <SEP> There's lots of shades of greens. But the colors. I just love all the different colors. Yeah. They had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to. But you don't have much spare time either? Well not lately. I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there. <SEP> Oh yes. And that does take some time. And if we're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby. And. Yeah. How old? He's seven months old. Oh yeah. <SEP> And just into everything. So there's not a spare moment. Oh but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I've been trying to do some bibs for him. And uh work on his Christmas stocking. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. We missed it last year. So hopefully this year he'll have one. Yeah. Well last year he was a little bit young for having one. <SEP> Right. He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway. You would have. But. <SEP> Right. If it tasted good yeah. All he liked was the lights this year. So. Oh yeah. Oh well that's neat that you like cross-stitching also. Yeah. That's that's kind of strange that we got the same call. <SEP> Yeah. It's a call. Oh I'm sorry. Go ahead. No. That's okay. <SEP> Okay uh. But yeah. I've been doing it for probably ten years or so. Oh wow. No. I just started about well five years ago I think. But it is peaceful. I mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it. Uh-huh. There's also a couple of large projects baby afghans. And I got one done. And I think the other one is going. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished. <SEP> On that uh. Bear thing. Is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the with the large squares? Well yeah. I just I bought the cloth and the pattern for it. I didn't um I didn't buy the uh I didn't buy a kit. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching. Uh-huh. It's that cloth. Oh okay. It's an- cloth I think. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it has the borders and everything already. Yeah. Those are pretty. Number one turned out just great. And the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery. And I didn't even know it. <SEP> Oh that's a. I gave it to her. And she said how did you know those are the colors we used. I said didn't. That was a good. It worked out that way. <SEP> That's great. Uh that uh. Now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it. Uh-huh. I like those. Those are pretty. Yeah. Lilly Lilly she said she said it's for your daughter to use. Oh no. She said I know she doesn't get to touch it. She hung it on the wall. <SEP> Yes. My uh grandmother um made us a couple of quilts for the baby. And I was like oh I don't want to mess those up. Yeah. Uh they're just too nice. I mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore. Yeah. <SEP> Oh yeah. True. Well I've enjoyed this. Okay. <SEP> But uh well keep up the good um. Keep up the cross-stitching. You too. All right. Thanks. Uh-huh. Bye bye. <SEP> Bye bye.
