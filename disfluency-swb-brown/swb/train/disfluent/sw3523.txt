We're set. Okay. What changes do you feel have happened? <SEP> Oh I guess the first thing has been the uh for the right for women to vote. I think that has been a major change and also the fact that uh there are so mu- many more women in the work force nowadays than there were. And that's probably going to increase. You know. Right. Increases each year doesn't it? <SEP> I'm sorry? It increases each year I think. It sure does. Yeah. There is a lot more women in the work place nowadays. Well and I think women have kind of had uh in the past the real subservient role. <SEP> Role? Right. And uh. <SEP> That's changing. Well we do to some degree. Right. But uh uh I think it's not as much as it was. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I I agree. It definitely has changed. I And especially I think with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more from men. <SEP> Uh-huh. Because there is just i- impossible to keep up on everything else. Yeah. Yeah. Have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home. <SEP> Well you know they've been talking about. And I don't know uh what the status is on it. But you know women get maternity leave and stuff like that. And I know that they've there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out. Right. But you know I haven't really heard much about that recently. Well you know there is a lot of companies that won't give mat- women maternity leave for that very reason. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh in fact I know the school districts down here you they don't have maternity leave. Uh you simply have to take accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave. Oh is that right? <SEP> Oh. Uh-huh. And I don't know uh if bigger company companies do. But when I was employed with the school district I didn't have maternity leave either. And that was the reason. Because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men. But So uh. <SEP> Huh that's interesting. That's a bummer though. Yeah. It is. <SEP> I mean You got to take the time off. You have to save all of your uh vacation time. You do. You have to save all your vacation time. And that's usually how it's uh happened. <SEP> Yeah. But uh. Uh-huh. What do you see uh changing in the future? <SEP> I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies uh run by females. Right. And and top level. And we'll prob-. <SEP> I'm sorry? Maybe top level. Right. Right. Upper management. More women in upper management. And probably uh we'll see more females in political roles. More governors and I think you know roles like that. That would be kind of nice. <SEP> Well we've got in Texas we have a female governor. That's right. That's right. And we had a female mayor here in Dallas. And she just her term just ended. And uh so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future. Yeah. <SEP> I think that's probably good. A little more integration. Uh-huh. And uh maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners. And. <SEP> Right you know. I mean and that's fine with me. I think. But sometimes. I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means. But I do. Right. <SEP> There are issues that you know as far as like equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff I totally am for. Right. But I don't get into the uh the real women libber movement you know. No. I don't either. <SEP> I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal. Yeah. We just function differently. <SEP> Right. Right. And uh I'm not capable of lifting what uh a man can lift and you know that type of that type of thing. Yeah. But uh one of the big changes uh they're doing in Salt Lake is uh. <SEP> Right. And they're probably. I'm sure in Dallas since you're big places a lot more women are uh working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever. Yeah. I I've heard of that. Uh I haven't really talked to anybody that's you know too involved with that. But I mean I think that is a. I think that. <SEP> Like the cottage industry. Is is that what you're talking about women working out of their homes? Right. Yeah. Uh I think it's wonderful. Right. You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week. And. <SEP> Yeah. Course they're talking about uh that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that. Oh I kn-. <SEP> By the phone and all that. So uh it would be kind of exciting in some ways to to see a little bit more of that. And some ways it might be kind of scary. Right. Think anybody could do it. But Anyway. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up. Right. <SEP> Right. But then you know there is the process of selection. Would you have to give them the brand. Right. And uh You know when you shop you usually compare the prices. <SEP> Right. And would be nice though.
