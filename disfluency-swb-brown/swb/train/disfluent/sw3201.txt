So do you have any recycling programs there? Um I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh we're a pretty small town. And uh the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart that show you know plastics paper liter bottles et cetera et cetera. Oh uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> We've progressed a little bit farther than that. Yeah. Um actually they have uh. Parts of town. It may have even spread all over the whole town. And um they will have these green bins. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it's just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump. Yeah. And uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin. And you put your bottles in it and paper and uh you know all those things that wh-. Aluminum. You know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin. <SEP> Oh. And uh I guess you can al-. And a lot of the restaurants they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles. Yeah. <SEP> Huh. And uh oh I don't know. I guess they're you know clear bottles. Yeah. So um you know a lot of people do have those separated. And of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos. <SEP> Yeah. Uh and they have those strateg- strategically placed around the city. Oh. And uh they're they're actually going to extend it I think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes. And uh. <SEP> Oh that would be good. Yeah. Things of that nature. So I guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary. Yeah. See it's not anywhere near that. <SEP> Uh we you know. As far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans. Oh yeah. But that's as far as we go. Because I take them to a girl at work. And she goes and cashes them in because you know. I just I can do that for her. Uh-huh. <SEP> And and I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it. Yeah. Oh really? <SEP> Yeah. Huh. See we don't have anything here in Belton. It's it's a pretty small little town. Yeah. I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans. <SEP> Yeah. And uh. So you know that's about all the that we're doing here. Uh they're uh getting a little bit more on. They need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you can't. Because you know not a lot of people do really know what you know what it's for. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. They're doing a real good job of uh separating it here. And of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper. Yeah. And uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it. But they actually have the door to door pickup. Um and it's uh I think it started out to be um just kind of a test a pilot project. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it went over so well that they just extended it. And it's almost uh. I don't know if it's done by a private company or not. It may be. But uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up. Wow that's excellent. Yeah. <SEP> That's good. Let's see. Oh and every year of course the phone books um they tell everybody across the city to uh put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins. Yeah. <SEP> Oh. Because you know phone books are pretty. Well for a bigger city they're pretty thick. Yeah. They are. And sometimes you might have two or three. <SEP> Exactly. So uh that's that's a big savings right there in itself. Yeah. See ours just goes in the regular trash. Yeah. <SEP> It just you know there's not a whole lot. Huh. And there are you know some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff. Uh-huh. <SEP> But usually it's it it hasn't caught on yet. I'm hoping it will soon. Uh-huh. Well the thing about newspapers and paper. Recycled paper is actually very expensive. Yeah. So when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that. It's uh. They're not coming out ahead at all. It's uh it's really a cost. <SEP> Huh. I wasn't totally aware of that. Yeah. So. I mean it it sounds good to the public. But there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something. Now aluminum I don't know. They may be coming out ahead. But I know for a fact that the paper uh on that end they're not you know. <SEP> Yeah. It's just good to recycle. But it's uh not to their advantage. Yeah. And it costs less. <SEP> Huh. Well. I can't think of anything else. I can't either. Because we're we're at a very you know beginning stages. Okay. <SEP> So. Uh-huh. We look forward to it to get better. Well I hope you all um uh come along a little farther in the future. <SEP> Yeah. Me too. It was nice talking to you. You too. Bye-bye. <SEP> Bye.
