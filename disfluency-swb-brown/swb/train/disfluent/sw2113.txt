Uh the last movie that I saw. I I don't go to that many. So I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see. But uh it was AWAKENINGS with uh Robin Williams and uh Peter DeNiro. Okay. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. Have you seen it. No. Unfortunately I haven't. I heard it's really good. But. It is. I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro. <SEP> Uh-huh. He is one of the best actors I've ever seen. It's. There's a point where. The uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that. This doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less. But it wears off. Uh-huh. And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh. It starts off with like a tic. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all. And it was just so realistic. The way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor. Uh-huh. What does uh. Is. Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in it? No. It was very serious very se-. <SEP> Oh how does he do serious. He's good. He's he's talented. Boy he is. I've only seen him in funny stuff. And so. I know. Me too. But uh well what was that show um Gar- uh Garf-. I want to say Garfield. But that wasn't it. <SEP> Yeah. Uh GARP THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. Yeah. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. He wasn't always funny in that show was he. I didn't read see the the movie. I read the book. But I. I did too. That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part. <SEP> Yeah. In fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it. So. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well what have you seen? <SEP> I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES. Oh I saw it. Good. We've both seen one. Did you cry through it? Yes. The whole way. <SEP> It was telling a friend I I said I only cried twice. But each was about half an hour long. So. Where did you cry. Um let's see. When I each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed I cried. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um I cried the first time when the um the wagon man got killed when they attacked him. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. And uh I think from there on all the way through the movie. Let's see what else did it. Um what other parts. I can't remember any of the other parts right off now. I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed. <SEP> We-. I don't remember when the horse got killed. Oh th-. When he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him. Oh yeah. And then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. And that horse has been such a pal to him when he was alone. Yeah. You can tell I'm an animal lover. You can hear my dog. <SEP> Unfortunately we don't have any animals. So uh. Yeah. It was a beautiful story. It really was. It. There was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> What did you think about the buffalo scenes. Oh I thought it was awful and so graphic. That was. <SEP> Yeah. I mean I hadn't even imagined it you know. I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo. Uh-huh. Um I had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie. <SEP> Oh oh. Of course they raise them now you know to eat. Uh-huh. Yeah. It's not. But she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in. No. It wasn't. Um I thought the scenes when the buffalos running though were beautiful. Like that was great. Oh yeah. <SEP> And there were so many of them. I didn't know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place. Yeah. Really. So that was pretty. And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path. <SEP> Yeah. And it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing. I wonder how they kept up with them though. It seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast. I know. <SEP> I guess they graze though. That wouldn't be a problem. Yeah. Yeah. Uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie. No. Huh-uh. It was. They tried to keep it you know as very close to real. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes. And uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl. Oh. That's the part they had trouble finding was wolves. <SEP> I guess they're just not domesticated. Or or. Yeah. What. They just don't howl that much anymore. Uh. That'll teach them in a couple minutes huh. I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off. And that's all they'd have to do. <SEP> Yeah. Well that's funny. Well I think we've made it. <SEP> Oh is that five minutes. Is that. I don't know. Is it five or three. Okay oh. I'm not sure. I'm not either. <SEP> Okay. Well I think we're we're we've done okay though. Okay. Me too. Well thank you for calling. Well thank you. <SEP> And I hope you enjoy some more good movies late-. Yeah. You too. Bye bye. Bye bye.
