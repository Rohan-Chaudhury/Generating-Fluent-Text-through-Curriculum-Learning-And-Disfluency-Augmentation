Well you keep up with current events? Um somewhat. Yeah. Somewhat. Not. <SEP> Not as well as I would like to probably. Is that right? But that's the way it goes. Yeah. Where whereabouts in Pennsylvania. <SEP> What? Where in Pennsylvania? Um State College. I go to Penn State. Oh do you. Well great. <SEP> Yep. How's uh. Well no. We're not supposed to talk about that. We're supposed to talk about current events. Right. Exactly uh. Well I'm a current event junkie. So I I watch I try to watch the news. And I read the newspaper. And I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world. <SEP> I see. Well what particularly are you interested in? Well I just pretty uh little you know about everything. And not and then again not everything. <SEP> Uh-huh. But you know I like to know pretty well what's happening. Political things don't interest me a great deal except I do like to stay informed enough to feel like I halfway vote intelligently you know. Uh-huh. But uh other than that uh I just you know. Just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and know feel like I know what's going on. <SEP> Yeah. Now I have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events. I see. But I always have been. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I stay up with it. But uh how do you how do you uh stay aware of most of the current events. Uh newspaper? T V news or what? Um uh well some of both. <SEP> Uh-huh. I read I read the newspapers sometimes. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I watch C N N that sort of thing occasionally. Right. Yeah. That's good. <SEP> And I read magazines and such. Well you stay up with it pretty well then. Well yeah. I mean not not that badly anyway. Uh-huh. <SEP> So I am I am interested in what's going on. And I'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there. Uh-huh. Yes. Uh-huh. Oh you've been there. <SEP> And yeah. Well you would be interested in it then. Right. Exactly. Yeah uh. I follow it you know. I don't just read everything about it. But I'm always aware of what's going on like that. <SEP> Yep. And uh because it is it's interesting. Uh-huh. And uh I don't know. I feel sorry for those people down there. They've just been so terribly mistreated for so many many years you know. I mean through Papa Doc. <SEP> That's true. They've never really had a good leader. I mean he was a terrible tyrant. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I think it's been better since he died. But it's still been bad. <SEP> Yeah. But uh even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh. I've read some things about him that he was he wasn't too good himself. Oh yeah? Yeah. He was pretty pretty much a. He didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh It's one of the reasons the U S wasn't so you know didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them. I see. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh but then again who you know. Those people are so used to it. I guess it's the only thing that works. Yeah. So what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America? I think it's pretty darned good. I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have. <SEP> Uh-huh. I really do. Now I they sometimes they jump on it and and and go a little to the extreme. The media does. But uh but that's kind of understandable because you know of course if you watch it more more than once a day I mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over. And I listen to the radio. Right. Right. So I you hear so much. You get a little tired of it. But then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe. <SEP> Yep. But I think the quality of our uh our news is just uh I don't believe it could be better. Uh-huh. I really don't. <SEP> Yeah. Well you know I think it probably could be it always could be better. But I would agree that it's pretty good. I don't think so. I don't think our news could be better. <SEP> Yeah. I I mean I mean what else could they do to make it better. Um. I don't see anything that they could do. <SEP> Yeah. Well I think that um. I don't know. Well you always want to think everything can be improved upon. The um. <SEP> Right. I understand what you're saying. Right. I think that. But by trial and error over the years I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it. <SEP> Well that may be so. Yeah. Uh nothing is perfect. I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well that's true. I understand what you're saying. And then again I understand why they can't dig too much deeper. That's why we have C N N. <SEP> Right. C N N has the time since that's all they do is news to dig deeper. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right.
