Um I think life uh. Now I grew up on a farm. I don't. What kind. Did you grow up in the farm. I grew up in um. Well at that time I was in a uh Trenton New Jersey. So and it was a suburb of Trenton. So I really had mixture of suburb and urban living. Uh-huh. <SEP> I see I see well lit- little bit different. Yeah. I think though it was much slower and uh much more self-contained. <SEP> I think you're right. It's interesting. I'm um I work in a high school. Uh-huh. So uh I'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago to what I see these children doing. Yes. <SEP> And the pressures on the children uh you know. You hear this as an excuse. But it's true they are so much greater. Unreal unreal by comparison. Oh I can not believe uh what they're doing uh academically the demands on them. And uh and I can see why children do drop out. Yeah. I think that's right. <SEP> I can see I can see the uh you know. I I can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where I wanted to go. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It wasn't it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me. They were. <SEP> And you you didn't you didn't have to lock your door. No. No. And uh a lo-. Some of these are urban worries. But uh it's uh it's a lot different all though I guess twenty years a go now in this area things were um similar because twenty years ago. Let's see. It was after. It's not all that long ago is it. <SEP> Yeah to. Twenty twenty-five years ago is when we had the Washington riots. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. The first rights we've been having some problem now. And it reminded me of that. Yeah. We were living in New Jersey. Uh in twenty years ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. Whereabouts? In Allendale. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I use to have to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on at sometimes. Uh-huh. Um I don't know though. It's it's kind of hard to really know because of. Though the news media had those riots uh kind of blown up out of proportion. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well. Because I went there many times. And. The Washington riots weren't. Because. I never I never saw a riot. Did you? <SEP> The Washington riots weren't. Because I lived right downtown Washington. And uh and what you saw is was what you got. I'm telling you. That's what. Yeah. Well. <SEP> Yeah. But you know it's it is interesting uh. They're so many mor-. They're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures uh. The pressures of drug is so much. The prevalence is so much greater. Uh-huh. The the kinds of diseases that you've got out the uh um. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean the consequences is. So much of what's going on is so much more serious then when we were younger. I think that's true. I think that's true. I think the other thing is that uh we have taken some rather drastic turns in our in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when when I'm number one you know and uh uh uh worrying about self and not uh seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And uh and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and uh support for young people that the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things. Yes. And. If you don't have some kind of of basic believe or something down inside of you then it's very difficult to uh have anything to turn to when you got when you've got something facing you like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's true. <SEP> I also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents um children who will lie and cheat. And you approach their parents. And their parents are constantly justify them rather then to. Uh-huh. Uh you know they're constantly excusing their child. Like. <SEP> Right. And you can see exactly why the child is that way. Yeah. Exactly. <SEP> You can as a teacher can't hold a child accountable if you're not going to get reinforced by that at home. Yeah. That's right. <SEP> That's right. And you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day what's not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home. No. <SEP> That's right. Oh. <SEP> And you're you get mixed signals. So it's it's not always the school's systems. I think a lot of. It is the families the way you were mentioning. No. There's so much more then that. It starts very much deeper then that. Yeah. I think that too. I see some flickers of of uh of good directions turning. <SEP> No. But whether they're soon enough and fast enough I don't know. It's just. Of course life is a lot more complicated too in ways um. The kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now. Right. <SEP> Uh you know with farming being so mechanized uh people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely. Uh-huh. Factory jobs are so much more um uh sophisticated. Yeah. That's right. <SEP> And the kinds of knowledge that uh you know. It it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force. And some people just don't have it. Right. And there's so much so so many people on the lower end of those who who are going to be the the drop outs and the and the poor and the homeless and whatnot. <SEP> And you worry when you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children. Yeah. That's just another. <SEP> Uh in terms of what it's going to mean to a society in the future it's a. Yeah. Some ways it's rather frightening. It really is. It's just it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of of the jobs that is out there to be done in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be. <SEP> It certainly is. Well it sure is. <SEP> It sure is. Uh not that I really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago. But. It was a little easier though wasn't it? Uh yeah. Just the volume makes a big difference. <SEP> Yes. I think as uh as uh mother you know I use to think sometimes it's not so much uh it's not so much the kids. It's just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and you know and everything. Yeah. And all the things demanded of the mother too I mean. <SEP> Right. Uh I look at my mother's life. I mean she she didn't work um um. For a long time whe- when I was very young she didn't drive. Uh she learned to drive I think when I was um a teenager. And her life was a lot simpler. Right and and children's lives were simpler because mother was there. <SEP> And I sit here. Somebody was there. That's right. And and when there's nobody there. <SEP> That's right. That's right. I always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their child when their children are little. And I and I think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much. But I I believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go to go work was when they were teenagers. They need you more as a teenager. <SEP> Isn't that true. That's why I'm working in a school system so that I'm home when they're home. Um. Right. It's not so much that they come to you every minute. But it's that you are there when they need you. That's exac-. Isn't that. That's so true. Yeah. <SEP> Uh uh I find working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do. Yeah. And it keeps me from being the old fogy. So but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes. <SEP> Yes. I think that's true. As to what's com-. But that's the same. I'm home in the summers. I'm home with the holidays. Yeah. That's. <SEP> I'm home at three o clock when the children are at home. Or where home. Yeah. One is now a senior in high school and the other's in college. Well. <SEP> And uh. But that helps a lot. It's uh it uh it does. I have a daughter who just had a second job. She needed to work. And he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her. And uh and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's right. And uh and so I. You know good kind of experience as well. But uh. <SEP> Well I. I think that's really important. I don't think people realize how important it is. That's that is that is so true. Yeah uh. <SEP> And it's not that always that the children always say something. But every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment. Yeah. And you realize it's important that uh. And yet you know we have to make that choice. I think twenty thirty years ago a lot of women just didn't have to make that choice. Yeah. <SEP> I think that's right. What was what was your name again? Well I. Linda Lee. Linda. <SEP> Uh-huh. Okay. And your name was? Well I think probably that we've just about. <SEP> Well I enjoyed talking with you. I'm going to change the world. But uh. <SEP> Well I enjoyed talking with you. Yes. It's nice talking to you too. Okay. Bye now. <SEP> Bye-bye.
