All right. Well uh quite a few. And they're varied. They don't uh uh encompass uh many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing. Uh-huh. But I do uh quite a bit of wreath making. And my dogs are my hobbies. I do a lot of gardening. I go to estate sales which takes up a lot of time. <SEP> Uh-huh. Now what do you mostly do? Well mostly right now I'm a I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible. We're uh we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff. Oh. <SEP> So. Boy. Yeah. That should be fun. <SEP> Yeah. Fun for them. Yeah. How old are they? Uh I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three. Well I think that's better than having that party at home. <SEP> Yeah. Well uh this is a friend's party. And they they rented. Or you know they. The party. They uh just rent skates and stuff for the kids. Yeah. So uh they're they're looking forward to it. And the the the skating rink does the rest practically I guess. <SEP> <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Boy what a help that is. <SEP> Yeah. So uh. What kind of. How long have you lived in North Carolina? Well not that long. <SEP> Really? Uh just since October. We moved here from Enid Oklahoma. Oh. Uh-huh. So uh we are we're originally from Virginia this part of the country. <SEP> Uh-huh. But we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid and loved it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But we needed to get back uh to our older parents. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I am loving it. The weather is divine. Really? Yes. <SEP> W- uh. Did you like Oklahoma while you were there? Oh yes. Very much. Yeah. <SEP> Um what did you all do? Well my husband was with uh University of Oklahoma and Phillips University in Enid. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then he went with uh a family corporation that had uh has oil and ranching and varied enterprises. Uh-huh. And uh he just quit a perfectly good job and came we came East. <SEP> Really? Yes. So is uh is he working there then. Or. Yes. Uh-huh. He's doing uh quite a bit of consulting work and has been offered a permanent position. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. And he's contemplating. Uh-huh. He he's liking this free time actually. <SEP> Oh yeah. It's just wonderful after all these years of working. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well how did how did you get uh hooked up with the T I switchboard thing? Um a gal who works uh with T I on this project. Uh-huh. I think she's a temporary worker. Uh mother is my best friend in Virginia. <SEP> Oh I see. So we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country. I see. <SEP> Uh-huh. W-. My wife has talked more than I have uh. She's talked to four five different people. It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas. In fact she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina I think. Really? Yeah. Uh what is her name? <SEP> Her name's Tina. Yeah. Well I haven't talked to her. I haven't I haven't talked to a Tina yet. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. W-. Uh the the call was probably for her. They wouldn't accept my uh T I N number. So we put hers in. But uh uh like I said we're getting getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party. Yeah. So. Yeah. <SEP> But uh some of. Yeah. I I've only talked to one or two. And they've they've all been in Dallas. But she hasn't talked to anybody in Dallas yet. Yeah. Yeah. So that's interesting. Well you haven't told me uh what sports that you are active in. <SEP> Well the sport I like best probably is basketball. But uh I guess I'm probably better at softball. And so I'd. Like during the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my time. Yes. But I play in a couple of leagues and and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend. But my family usually goes with me. We try to do everything we can together. Well I think that's uh easy entertainment for a family too. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well they uh. A good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we uh. That's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff. And they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age. So they play together pretty well. Under the stands. <SEP> And. Under the bleachers. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Pretty much. And uh Tina enjoys uh the other lady real well. Uh-huh. <SEP> So they. You know that's kind of nice. It's like getting together with them. Yes. Well it's getting a little hot isn't it? <SEP> So to speak. It. Yeah. Well it's been raining a lot here so far. So we haven't really had any kind of real heat. I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in in the house. So it looks like an air conditioner day. Yeah. <SEP> But. It sure does. Or maybe this evening anyway. Yeah. It. Yeah. But you know I'm sure you're familiar with that living here. Very much so. <SEP> We go we go through Enid you know quite a bit. We go to Tulsa from time to time. And my my parents live in southern Illinois. So we drive up there. Yeah. <SEP> And well l- lot of times we take seventy-five. And uh it seems like seems like that goes through Enid I know. No. No. It doesn't. <SEP> I've either seen the signs or. Enid is uh. It's in the northwest. It's uh directly across the straight uh state from Tulsa. Uh. Um. I know I've seen the sign somewhere. Sure you have. <SEP> Yes. Well Enid is not uh an unknown little city. Yeah. It uh. <SEP> Right. An awful lot of people know where it is or have been there. And it was uh a very uh self-sufficient uh wealthy uh town for a long time anyway. You know until uh everything happened. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh. Uh-huh. The bottom fell out. But. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. It's beginning to do well. But there's a lot of uh old time wealth there that has helped to stabilize things. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So uh how l-. You said you've just lived in North Carolina just like six months then is. Si-. Yes. Something like that. <SEP> And you really like it there huh? Oh. I've heard so many people talk about that area. I've never been there. Well it's it's pretty. <SEP> But they sure say it's pretty. The weather is wonderful. Uh this winter we. It was just. We had so many wonderful days. And. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I. If it got to be forty degrees I decided it was too cold to to walk the dogs. Isn't it funny how how your standards change? Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It really does. My wife and I spent a couple years uh doing church work up in the state of Washington right on the coast. Yes. <SEP> And it rains you know a lot there. Sure. But you get used to it. I mean it's like a fine mist all the time. And it doesn't really. It gets to where it doesn't bother you. Well. <SEP> Carolina this part is very much like that too. Very foggy and misty. Really? <SEP> It. The moss grows on the trees in the woods up eight ten feet. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Right. <SEP> Yeah. That's the way it is was there too. Yeah. I think however that's like February.
