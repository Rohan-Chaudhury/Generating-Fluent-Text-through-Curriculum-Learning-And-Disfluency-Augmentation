Uh being a former drug user. I uh I I guess I have to say at this point that I do approve of it. Whoa. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh because I know that uh in using drugs I was not a good employee. Uh-huh. And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there uh. Whenever you are an employee of the company you are using its assets. And uh b- you are also under their liability under the Workmen's Comp. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases. And I work for a tire company Modern Tire. Where do you work? <SEP> Oh. And uh it's also a retreading plant. And that's where most of our uh injuries occur. Uh-huh. And what we do is we'll have a drug test if an if a a break or a man uh has an accident. Then he's automatically uh given a drug test. <SEP> Right. Do they do it like you know within hours of the accident. Or is it? Yes. When he goes to the doctor the first time. Yeah. And so that kind of uh. I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Now we've let some people go uh that wa- we was found that drugs were used in their system. Now I don't know how T E C would handle it. They haven't pursued it you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh if there's some uh problem I know. There was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines. And he went to a a separate drug testing firm. Yeah. And they showed it negative. <SEP> Huh. So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I think that's probably true too. That's that's that's sort of scary. Uh-huh. Really. And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine. Yeah. And he tested positive on cocaine. Now then you always wonder well is he just saying that. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Really. Really. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's a bad situation. I think that probably I think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I think they should. Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm a T I employee. And and and uh I'm I'm really gung ho for it. Uh-huh. In fact I you know. Some of the places now um like I B M don't allow them smoking you know in in the plant. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. We we have designated smoking areas. Yeah. <SEP> But um I work in sort of a building that's that's not really well. It's on the campus of the T I facility. But it's a little bit you know separated. We lease the building. And it's it's a factory environment. Uh-huh. And uh they they have designated smoking. But it's just wide open. It's not ventilated properly. Yeah. <SEP> And I think that's bad. But as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's a it's a definite I think it's essential. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that. <SEP> Yeah. In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to came come up you know. They never they never called me. They never you know. And finally the day we declared war was my time. You're kidding. <SEP> No. And so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times I think. And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group. The executives right? Right. Right. And of course you know they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first. <SEP> The executives? Uh-huh. Yeah. Wouldn't that be awful if you were if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything. <SEP> Which I thought was interesting. Oh man. Yeah. <SEP> Ooh yeah. I can't believe I was so brazen before. I like I say I'm a former drug user. Uh-huh. But uh I I well I I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior. And so I don't use drugs any more. <SEP> Oh what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind? Uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines. Wow !. Um yes. Uh-huh. <SEP> And all on the job too. Really? You know it had gotten that bad. <SEP> Well it's really lucky that you got away from that. Really. Cause that's really downward spiral. It's it's. Life is so much more enjoyable. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's it. I mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing. <SEP> Yeah. Just life in general. Uh-huh. That's right. Yeah. Well well I'm definitely for it. Yeah. <SEP> Plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life. That's right. In some cases. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Like uh my husband uh several years back worked for Motorola. Uh-huh. And they had you know. I mean it was a chemical handling type. Oh goodness. <SEP> Yeah. I mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know. Yeah. Like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing. Yeah. <SEP> And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals. Oh my gosh. And that's really that's really frightening. Yeah. <SEP> So I think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know on on a on a greater frequency than maybe just you know paper pushers like like I am. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> I would think there would be. Well well you'd think so. But uh. But they weren't? <SEP> I don't know if they do it till yet. Isn't that awful. Because when he was at. Course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at T I. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I forgot what. I guess it was like eighty-four eighty-five something like that. Yeah. And they at that time they had no testing whatsoever. Huh. <SEP> So that's scary. Yeah. That reminds me of uh. I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time. And I have just casually asked her what he did for a living. And she said Oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff. Oh Lord. <SEP> Oh. And I just you know went Oh where? Yeah. Should we move? Let me move as far away as possible. <SEP> Ooh. Yeah. That's awful. But I'm proud though that that um you know I grew up in the sixties. And back then it was popular you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. But people have really wizened you know become wise about drugs. <SEP> Yeah. And they really have a good campaign for the young people you know. Uh-huh. They know it's not smart. So. So I guess it was just a generational thing. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Peer group is the other way now instead of. That's right. And that's good. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's. That's the best way to stop it. Yeah. That it really is. Yeah. Well I think we did it. <SEP> Okay. So it's good talking to you. Well I enjoyed talking to you Cathy. Yeah. Bye-bye.
