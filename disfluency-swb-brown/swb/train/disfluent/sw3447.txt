The way. I'll go ahead and start. The way I work uh the way I dress for work is uh this year nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie. Uh-huh. Or I shouldn't say suit but coat and tie every day. <SEP> Uh-huh. A a year ago I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Which means kind of a I guess it's a different set of standards I guess. Yeah. So uh I I dress almost the same every day. I mean pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> But it was very different before. How do you dress? Well I'm a drafter. So I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes. And I have sweatshirt on today. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's pretty much the norm for me. If I come in in a dress everybody's shocked. Yeah. I understand. They ask me you know what are you doing in a dress. And it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately. Right. <SEP> Ran out of jeans. I understand. That's funny. So does it change? No. Your dress. No. <SEP> No. Huh-uh. So or I guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that? No. Huh-uh. So back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like. <SEP> Uh-huh. But probably once a month or so there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in. But that's for my husband's job and not mine. Oh I see. I understand. I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him. But. Oh. Well that's interesting. <SEP> So. Let's see uh what else about this uh. It it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two like two or three levels. Uh-huh. That there's the t- upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I would if you if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I guess you are. Uh-huh. That we dress in the jeans. And then there's kind of the the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. But there's not much. <SEP> Mi- middle of the road. It's nice that there's not a requirement for it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sometimes I think there should be. Some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. I guess you see those once in a while. <SEP> And you know the they have the no shorts deal. And some of these mini skirts you know are worse than shorts ever thought about being. Sure. But uh You know that's I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code. Yeah. <SEP> That's right. That's right. I guess they're the isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps. I'm not even sure what they are. Supposedly and backless things. Oh backless. All right. <SEP> But I've seen those too. But. Okay. So this wasn't necessarily a big conversation. But I think we we did it. <SEP> Uh yeah. Okay. And and your name was Lisa. Lisa. Great. <SEP> Are you the Expressway sites? I am. Yes. And I work in the north building. Oh okay. Uh well thank you. <SEP> Thank you. All right. Good day. Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
