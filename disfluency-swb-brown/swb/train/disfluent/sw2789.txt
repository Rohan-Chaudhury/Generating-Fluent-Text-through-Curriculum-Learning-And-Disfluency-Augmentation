Okay. Are you on any kind of uh regular exercise plan? I I yeah I'm yeah I I do aerobics uh step classes and uh toning classes. Step classes? <SEP> Yes. What's that? It's uh it's a new uh form I think. Uh it's like low impact aerobics. But at it. Oh instead of hopping and jumping you just step. And. Oh okay. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. You you have a step. And you literally step up on the step and move your arms. It's it's it's it's new. Huh. <SEP> It's fun. I probably couldn't do that because of my knee. Uh-huh. Bad knee. Yeah. <SEP> Um and uh I do toning a lot and uh some. Every once in a while I play tennis. Yeah. I'm not too great at it. But I I try to play. Yeah. I've I've kind of gotten out of the habit myself. I mean it's. I guess what I do now is I play softball right now. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's about. Well right now I'm on two teams. So it's four nights a week. Gosh. But uh uh so I enjoy it. But as far as you know uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there I went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it. Uh-huh. <SEP> Ha. Right. Ye-. I need to make myself do that. Yeah. I slacked off a little because of um. I'm about to graduate from college. And so this past couple months have been really hectic. So I haven't really gone. And I've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out. But. What school you going to? <SEP> I'm at East Carolina. Oh. But um no. I uh. My step classes and toning is about the only thing. Well I mean. Now what's what's toning? Is that lift- lifting weights? <SEP> It's um like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups. Oh okay. You can do with. Isometrics stuff like that. <SEP> Yeah. You can do it with certain you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to. But you know you leave out of there. Usually the next morning if you haven't done it in a while you wake up the next morning. You're like oh no. What did I do to myself. And your whole body aches you know. Yeah. Um I know I'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape. Uh I feel like I'm out of shape. But I feel guilty for not going because I really I'm I'm so used to going for you know three or four years now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I stayed in pretty good shape during school. But um. I played baseball all the way through. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you know working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape. Oh yeah. <SEP> Oh yeah. But uh ever ever since I got out of school you know just jumped right into the job. And I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling. Uh-huh. <SEP> No. Some um. I walk a lot because uh you know being in in school we. Yeah. I don't know if your campus was anything like ours. But our parking lot's in one end of the of the campus. And the school the buildings are all at the other end. So. You ut-. No. I didn't have well much of a problem. We I guess I went to a small Baptist school. And we had about when I was there maybe thirteen hundred people. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh okay. That's if. So it's pretty small. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. Yeah. It's uh. I live I live on the second story apartments. So I walk up and down stairs all day long. So. <SEP> Uh. Uh we've got a one story house now. That's that's enough. I guess I push the lawn mower around. That's fairly regular. Yeah. <SEP> That's one of the exercise now. Yeah. I I um would like to start running. I've never been much of a runner. But I want to start. I want to run. But I don't I don't know if I'll be able to to do it. What. Just because yo- you don't like to or because because you won't be able to. <SEP> I'm I'm afraid I won't be able to. Oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running. I wish I'd. <SEP> Yeah. I hope not. Um. We've we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough. Uh-huh. I don't even own a bike. I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve. So. Uh I don't know. I'd be afraid afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike you know. No. You can't forget how to ride a bike. <SEP> Yeah. But um no. I guess that's about the only form. I'm trying to think of of other things that I do that will be considered exercise. Yeah. There are things I should do. I know it ju-. Now when I was going to. I I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred. Well when we were at this junior college uh our coach you know. We. One semester the whole team was required to take aerobics. And the next semester they were required to do weight lifting. <SEP> Uh-huh. So they uh. I mean it was a regular. I mean we had it for course credit. Uh-huh. But still I mean it was pretty high impact stuff. <SEP> Those aerobic classes are are tough the the high impact. Uh-huh. Definitely are are tough classes. Yeah. And she'd uh you know. Most of the guys were all in one class. So she'd kind of lay it on occasionally you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. First at eight I think we had. Eight o'clock in the morning was our class. Uh-huh. Wake up. <SEP> Well now they have those uh those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight. Uh-huh. You have like bands. I don't know if you've seen them. Yeah. <SEP> They're. Yeah they're they're weird. I think my wife has some. They're uh you ge- they're just made of I guess it's different kinds of rubber. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh and they get. Or sand even some of them. Well no. They're elastic. So I guess it wouldn't be sand. Uh-huh. And there's some that like the different colors denotes how much they how much the tension I guess they are and how easy they are to move. Huh. <SEP> Uh there's like I know there's purple gray and uh green. And some of them are real short. And they're the ones that are the tough ones to use you know. Yeah. But uh those classes I I enjoy. Uh I think uh with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun. If you don't have one that's fun and not enjoy it look not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out uh what they should get out of the class. Yeah. <SEP> Uh if the. So are you going to get into instructing? Well what are you studying? Oh I'm an interior design major. Oh okay. Not in the not in the aerobic instructor type field. <SEP> Oh. No. No. No. No. Oh I could never do that I don't think. <SEP> I'd rather just be the student. And uh Occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights just. Yeah. Yeah. The uh the some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting. I mean they they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups with those things. <SEP> Uh-huh. But man they are it ut-. I don't know. To me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Well they um I just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized one these computerized machines. And you set a speed on it and the weight. And it and it makes you do it. And it tells you. Like if you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you. And stuff like a turtle goes faster. And um it tells it. And the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you. A little negative reinforcement there while you're going. <SEP> Yeah. So uh do that stuff like that. But just I've never used those machines. I just use the regular machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights. Yeah. Just to do you know some bicep tricep exercises. Sit-ups of course. Yeah. That's that's where I'm really starting to get noticeable. <SEP> Uh-huh. I'm just getting real soft in the middle. Oh yeah. I think that's uh number one problem with everyone. Uh-huh. I haven't really started to put on a lot of weight. I'm I guess I probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds since I stopped playing which was about four years ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I've just myself I just notice myself just really real soft. And I'm sure I don't have near the endurance that I did. Yeah. But I I intend I keep saying I intend to get back into it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I just need to put the old nose to the grindstone. I I I guess at that point it would turn into a task. Uh-huh. I don't consider it fun doing that. But. <SEP> Right. Yeah. I plan on getting back once I graduate next weekend. Next weekend? Next weekend. All right. <SEP> Yeah. One week. Then I plan to get right back into it. You know it's it does a lot for you I think. Yeah. Makes you feel a lot better. Oh no. Yeah. There there's no no question the the end result is great. And I I mean I enjoyed you know. We. When I was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I mean you feel so much better about yourself. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Just that you know you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner. Oh I still don't. But. That's a problem. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. Well good luck on your graduation and your. All righty. Well thank you. It was nice talking to you. Yeah. You too. <SEP> Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.
