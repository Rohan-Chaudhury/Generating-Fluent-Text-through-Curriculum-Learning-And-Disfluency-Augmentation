Okay. So which uh what basketball teams are you interested in? Well I guess I'm a big Laker L A Laker fan when it comes to pros. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh the college ranks um I guess I really. Of course I try to follow my alma mater. That's uh B Y U in Utah. Uh-huh. But they don't have much of a team usually. No. They're more of a football team than they are basketball team. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. You see them in football on T V once in awhile. Yeah. You never see them on a on nationally basketball. You know that's true. I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball. <SEP> They uh last year they had a really good team. The year that Danny Aines was there. Uh-huh. That was about five six years ago by now. Huh. <SEP> So they made it to the sweet sixteen once or twice in their history. Um. That's not too bad. <SEP> And that's. And they usually lose in the first round. Uh-huh. <SEP> How about you? Well I'm uh originally from the Saint Louis area. So the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is Chicago. So I I do pull for Chicago. Uh-huh. I mean of course this year is a good year to be a a Chicago B- fan I guess because they're doing pretty good. <SEP> Is it the Bulls you're talking about? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The pro. Um as far as college teams uh I know it's really easy to say. But I've been pulling for uh Duke for about four years now. So uh so I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams. Although I've I've really you know. <SEP> Is that right? Again being from Saint Louis I pull for Missouri. Uh-huh. Uh but they're on uh probation this year. So you can't do much about that. <SEP> No. No. But uh. So did you watch the uh final four this year? Oh yeah. I watched every uh I watched all three games of that. <SEP> Every game? And uh I was very pleased with all three games because Kansas uh. You know I was pulling for Kansas on the other side. So it was real nice to have the the teams that were there. Right. Right. Of course I wasn't really. I mean I I. U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a uh uh oh I don't know a macho team you know. They just didn't seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else. And and maybe they were. But um I was real happy to see them get knocked off. So. <SEP> Yeah. I I watched that game. Uh-huh. And uh it was a good game. Oh yeah. <SEP> It was a very close game and hard fought game. And it just. I don't know. It looked like U N L V may have had more uh talent. Yeah. But as far as playing together as a team that day it didn't Duke seemed to have them off balance. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that uh they didn't couldn't. Aren't they more of a running gun team? U N L V. Yeah. They they play the pro style is what I've always called it. Right. And uh. <SEP> Yeah. Fast breaks and things and. Yeah. The fast breaks and and. They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed. And. Right. And uh U N L V wasn't used to that. Of course I've I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time. See I don't know if they were necessarily behind. But they weren't ahead as much as they normally are. <SEP> Right. Uh and you know that meant that they had to play a second half. And they they've not had to do that all year. And uh. Right. Right. They didn't have they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year. And that and that so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that right in when it when it counts so much. That's right. I mean Duke's schedule was was so much harder than U N L V's that it uh it just made them a much tougher team overall. <SEP> Right. And uh that had to help them a lot. I think I think that that probably was the difference in that game. Uh-huh. <SEP> Because it really could have gone an- either way. Down to the end you know. So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will uh will win. Well. Or. <SEP> I don't know. Probably not. I mean Portland's pretty good. Um. Since Kareem's retired they haven't had a center. Yeah. <SEP> And uh they've got Perkins. Yeah. But I don't think he's really been a super star for them. No. Well he's uh. I don't. I. He he to me is not a center. He's more of a a real tall forward. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Right. Uh. <SEP> So. I think Magic does a. They'll make it you know. I- i- it it's going to be a war between uh between Chicago and uh and uh uh Boston Celtics. Oh yeah. <SEP> That's going to be a war. That sure is. It. It's going to be a great series. I think that's going to be one of those that's uh that's won by the home team you know. <SEP> Yeah. Whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think. One of those two will probably be um in there. Um let me see. Where does Detroit fit in? Detroit's in that same uh that that same uh division. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I don't know. Those three. Uh Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year. No. But as I heard Isaiah came back this week. Uh-huh. So uh that might help them. <SEP> Yeah. They have the they have the play-off experience. But. Oh yeah. So does Detroit I mean so does Chicago. So do- all three of them do with Larry Bird back uh. Oh yeah. <SEP> You can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's starting to click on all cylinders. That's true. Uh-huh. <SEP> They say he's starting to do starting to play. He's yeah but he's been yeah but he's been kind of up and down all year. Right. Uh one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in. And then the next time he'll you know he can't seem to hit the side of a barn. <SEP> Right. So I don't know. Right. I'm I'm kind of I'm not sure about him this year. <SEP> Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now. Uh-huh. Well that's when you do it. He's starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year. <SEP> Yeah. Oh any dark horses I uh you know. Well the dark horses. <SEP> San Antonio San Antonio is the dark horse that could could really flip in there I think. Yeah. That's. Yeah. Well anybody who has David Robinson has got to have a chance anyway. <SEP> Yeah. He's got to be pretty much you know. I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player you know when he. Uh-huh. <SEP> Against any team he would dominate. But Robinson's getting up there where every game he's just. That's right. I mean it looks like he's going in for a dunk. And they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Nobody's got enough beef I guess to challenge him when he's when he's driving hard to the hoop. Huh. He's uh he's. Too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him. That's true. <SEP> With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble. Yeah. Well then he's gone now. So they don't have to worry about that. Yeah. For awhile anyway. Well I thought he was gone period. I I didn't read the story. But I I read that uh. <SEP> I heard he was suspended. Because of his. Well that might have been what it was. But I I guess the headlines said something about him you know that the Mavericks released him or something. I maybe I misunderstood what they meant. <SEP> Um. If they did they'd still have to pay his contract. Well yeah. They may have done it. You never know. <SEP> It was a lot of money. He was making like. Yeah. But. I heard on the radio it was sixty-three thousand and change a month. That's what he was being paid you know. He wasn't even playing. Yeah. <SEP> Oh boy what a good job he had. That's what I think. He ruined his sweet position. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I'm looking forward to the the pro play-off uh. Yeah. It's coming up isn't it. L A. Yeah. San Antonio. Who's the other one that's doing so well this year. Port- is that Portland? Portland. Yeah. Portland. <SEP> Portland. I haven't seen them on much T V that much at all. But all I can do is hear about. Boy they have the seeing eye. Uh-huh. What do they have. Walter Davis and. They've got two the two Johnson brothers. Or they're not brothers. But I mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something. I forget how that works. But um like I said they're doing extremely good right now. <SEP> Um. Phoenix isn't doing too bad. So It it ought to be a real interesting play-off. Right. Right. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think there's any clear pick you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of Bird and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson. Uh-huh. They are two guys that seem to find a way when they. When it's on the line. <SEP> When it's on the line they seem to find a way. You know. Uh-huh. Uh so those are what makes a champion I guess. Yeah. That's true. <SEP> Yeah. Well it's been nice talking to you. Nice talking to you. All right. Take care. <SEP> Take care. Bye.
