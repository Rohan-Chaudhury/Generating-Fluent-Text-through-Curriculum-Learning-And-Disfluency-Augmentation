Well I almost forgot the topic. I was waiting so long for uh for it to find somebody. Um. It's on your favorite T V shows and why. Right. Well so what is your favorite T V show? <SEP> Uh MAJOR DAD. Oh you like that one? I I love it. I think it promotes good family values. And it's funny. Uh-huh. Uh I've never really watched that one. You know it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows. <SEP> That's ri-. Yeah. And uh you know there's so there's only a few that I that I like to watch routinely. What kind do you like to watch? Probably my favorite is um oh. Well I like shows like GROWING PAINS. And uh what's the other one now they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night. So I don't get to watch it very much. <SEP> WONDER YEARS? WONDER YEARS. Yeah. That's my favorite. Uh. I like both of those real much also. I I think basically they pr- same thing they promote family values. Yeah. WONDER YEARS. I I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever. I guess I can really relate to it. And uh it's just a real cute show. Uh I I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of uh I don't know honesty or sort of a purity value I guess. <SEP> I do too. I I don't like it uh lot of the shows that that I've liked in the past like uh oh GOLDEN GIRLS. And some of them tend to get so risque. And when you have children uh watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Right. Right. And uh that's one of the reasons. I mean if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE. Uh-huh. Yeah. My wife really likes that show. <SEP> Yeah. Which I just I was I always felt was wonderful. Uh-huh. Uh and so many of them nowadays like I said I think are just um. Yeah. <SEP> Uh they they go after well. They. Like I said the risque stuff just I guess they think that's what people want to watch. Yeah. Well there was. But there's a sense of ho- I guess purity in the show. Like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS. Yes. But uh you know Richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure I guess. <SEP> Yeah. And when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it. Uh-huh. And I never did like it after that. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I don't know. I I say see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch. There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere. Yeah. I I agree. Uh do you like the sports programming? Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um I I enjoy those also almost as as much to a certain extent. I'm. Our whole house is baseball fans. Uh-huh. And uh we enjoy that. And uh. So you're going to watch a game tonight? <SEP> Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything? Uh probably the Pirates. But only because of Steve Bushel I guess. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> Otherwise I really don't care that much. But uh you know I'm I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him. And uh I'd like to see him do well like all the way to the bank I guess. Yes. Yeah. He's a nice guy. <SEP> I take it you live in the Dallas area. Pardon? Do you live in the Dallas area? <SEP> Live in live in Plano. Uh-huh. Yeah. I live in Garland. And yeah. I I like Steve Bushel. But I don't really like the Pirates. I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan. Uh-huh. So uh I'm kind of I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all. They you know they they've come from so far down. <SEP> Uh-huh. I really would like to see them do well. Well yeah. Yeah. It's uh. So I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do. Yeah. One one year they. Maybe they'll make it I don't know. <SEP> Right. So but uh yeah. I like sports programming quite a bit. But uh I guess my my favorite shows are the. And you know that getting back to the point that you made that's really true. We were watching ROSEANNE I guess couple of weeks ago. And her daughter was talking about birth control you know. Uh-huh. And my daughter was kind of walking in during that time. And you know she's only seven years old. So. <SEP> Well it's. So many of them now um you know it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in. And and uh you know I'm you know I'm I'm an adult. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> And I have adult tastes now. But I don't need that. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I I like things that uh are are wholesome I guess. Yeah. Well that that seems to be more our values too. Like the WONDER YEARS I I mean it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers. You know or and you can kind of relate to it you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't know. That's. I enjoy that a lot. Yes. Yes. But uh you know I agree with you. The. And it's funny because the shows. Like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff I think they they maintained. People would watch them because. There was that uh you know there was really the period that was going on there. I mean he really wasn't messing around with the girls. But everybody perceived him that way and stuff. <SEP> Uh-huh. But as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died. Yeah. And it's it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way.
