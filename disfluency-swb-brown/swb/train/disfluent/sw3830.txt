Hello? Hello. How you doing? <SEP> Fine. I'm Lee with uh uh. I'm over here in Plano Texas. Okay. Let me ask you something can I run a minute and shut my radio off? Oh sure. <SEP> Okay. Oh. Okay. Where are you calling from. Or where are you at? <SEP> Arlington. Arlington Texas. Arlington. <SEP> Yes. Well there's a lot of s- stuff going on in Arlington these days. Yes. Not all good stuff. Are you involved in any of that? <SEP> No. No. No. I'm not not personally. Well uh what benefits do. Now do you work? <SEP> I'm going to school right now. Oh you are? I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think. Okay. <SEP> Yeah. I've got a lot of. Because I I work for myself. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so uh there's a lot that I that I guess I do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation. I miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come. Yes. <SEP> Right. Yes. But uh. <SEP> Yes. I've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact. I'm selling in out now to go to school full time. And I enjoyed the freedom of having that you know. Oh is that right? Go to work when I wanted to or not. Uh-huh. <SEP> But you know the benefits weren't there. Yeah. So. I uh I own part of a roofing company. <SEP> Oh do you? In the in the Dallas Fort Worth area. Uh-huh. And uh you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they uh you know we we had all the benefits there. And and I do miss that. You know. Yeah. But uh on the other hand I I uh I enjoy having the the time that I have with my family and being able to you know work when I want. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Uh-huh. And. <SEP> I think today the thing that I uh would appreciate the most. Uh because my husband gets his medical through his company. But we have to pay for mine. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we're the only one I'm the only one that's being insured. And and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has I mean. Oh is that right? So it's kind of. Yeah. <SEP> And I would. I really. And the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to ha- you need to have. It's. Yeah. <SEP> It it. Yeah. I'll tell you what. That is the single most uh benefit that I that I enjoyed and I do miss. <SEP> Right. Because I looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just. And it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it. It's out of sight. <SEP> Right. It's out of sight. And uh yeah. Even at a group rate I couldn't believe how much is our. Oh yeah. <SEP> Even at a group rate. Uh it's it's unbelievable. And uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids. And and if you want to add dental to it I mean that's that eats even more. Right. It goes up. <SEP> Right. So yeah. I guess what the other benefits that uh that I uh that I miss I guess is uh you know some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know. Uh-huh. And course these days you can't count on that because. <SEP> Right. Uh you know I feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh G M deal there in in Arlington. Right. And I'm sure it will be you know quite a few people are affected by that. So. <SEP> Right. It's going to hurt the city. Although uh I will personally tell you I used to work at a bank. And I would see the G M people come in when they were they would shut down to retool. Uh-huh. They were paid that whole time. And I don't know if you're aware of this r-. Oh really? <SEP> Yes. They come in there. Just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and every Friday and go to the safety deposit box. And I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know. And And they had all these gr-. Is that right? I I really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked. The union. Yeah. <SEP> And right now anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck. I just read this in the paper the other day. Is that right? Plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at at uh through the company. So I'm sor- you know I'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt. Yeah. <SEP> But I don't feel as sorry for them. Well. If my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check. Really the. <SEP> And that would be it. Yeah. Really the ones it's going to hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area. Yes. <SEP> Oh yeah. That's already hurting. You know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh. <SEP> But I think there's a case where benefits have gotten. They voted them in. And they got so good I mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And it made the prices of cars go up. And and you know the. Uh-huh. <SEP> I we I believe in unions. But they went too far. Well I'll tell you I I've had my fill of unions. I mean I can't make eighteen dollars an hour. I. <SEP> I mean I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour. Oh yeah.
