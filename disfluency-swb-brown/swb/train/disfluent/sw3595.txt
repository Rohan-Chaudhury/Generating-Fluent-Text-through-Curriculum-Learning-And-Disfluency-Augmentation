Arlington Texas. Now since I got somebody from Arlington Virginia one day. Is that right? Yeah. <SEP> Well I never thought about that. But there is an Arlington. Like I had a call the other day from Birmingham Michigan you know. Oh. And I was thinking yeah and I was thinking. Birmingham. <SEP> The only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama. Right. It's funny how many names have been used uh all over the country. Yeah. Well tell me what kind of books have you read? Well to tell you the truth I've been going to college for the last four years. So mainly text books. <SEP> I was going to say not fun kind right? No um. But I I really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones. <SEP> Uh-huh. But you know sometimes biogr-. I just read one about Grace Kelley. I love to read about real people. To me half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories. Yeah. It is. Because you know that's it's really and truly a true thing. Yeah. It happened. <SEP> You know I read one about Bob Hope that I liked. Really? Yeah. That was real good. I'm like you. If it's not a heavy biography you know I enjoy it. Right. <SEP> I used to like to read about royalty a lot. I when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived I think in Europe. That was my thing for a while. I was trying to think uh. I read a uh a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all. And there was a murder. Oh really. <SEP> Yeah. It was some time ago. Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING or something like that. Oh it sounds like fun. It was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know. Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know. Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those. <SEP> Yeah. In fact I believe it was. Because. Really? Uh-huh. I believe. Sounds like something she would write. <SEP> Yeah. I think it was by her now that you mention it because someone had given it to me. And I thought well this will be great. And it was. Yeah. I've heard that she's done real- you know her books are really interesting. And they always sell well. Uh-huh. And uh. <SEP> Well when you use real people like that I think royalty especially you know. Yeah. Brings it to life. I know uh the Bri- some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty. <SEP> Yeah. But you know that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know. I know. Our movie stars. Our movie stars. Because it's totally different concept to us. Oh right. <SEP> I haven't I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either. I have read uh mostly novels. I went to visit my daughter in Florida. Um. And I took a novel with me uh and read it at Thanksgiving time. And uh it was uh one of those generation novels you know. Oh yes. <SEP> Starts out when they're small and continues through generations. Oh I always like those. And I like that. Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch? <SEP> Yes. I have. Isn't she fabulous? Oh she is wonderful. Oh once you st-. I don't like to get one of her books. Because I I just live to read. <SEP> I'll I'll skip everything just to get back to the book. I stayed up one night I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I star- I could not put it down. Oh yeah. <SEP> She's just a. I don't know. Does she how often does she come out with them. I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school. Well no. It seems like she doesn't write as often as oh well like Danielle Steele and those silly things. She writes the same thing. Well she can she can turn them out overnight I swear. <SEP> Yeah. And and they're the same silly things. I mean if you've read one I mean it's It it's practically the same thing over and over you know. Yeah. I've never read a whole one of hers I don't think. And think how rich she is. <SEP> Yeah. Wouldn't I you know. I'm criticizing her. And wouldn't I like to have her money. Oh yeah. Because they go from hardback to paperback. And she has millions of them. And then make movies out of some of them. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know mini series and so forth. And it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often. I have not seen as many of hers. Well hers are so involved. And they're so such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think she does a lot of research too. I do too. So she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers. Huh-uh. But oh her books are just incredible. I don't think they've ever made a movie do you? <SEP> No. I don't think so. And I've often wondered why haven't you? Yes. You know I. Well no uh. I really just thought about it now. But there's just. <SEP> Yeah. Maybe it's because they take so much in. I don't know. Uh-huh. Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know. They're so big. <SEP> Uh-huh. They're such you know. It would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND I guess another three hour movie. Yeah. <SEP> And maybe that turns people off. But look at GONE WITH THE WIND you know. Oh I know. It's about one of my favorite movies. Uh have you uh gotten into SCARLETT yet? No. It had such a bad press. I wasn't too. <SEP> Yeah. That's exactly what I was going to say. I was amazed. Because I. In the beginning when it was on you know on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> And then when it came out all I heard was just oh how bad it was that I didn't even want to get it. Me either. Do you know anyone that's read it? Huh-uh. No. I haven't heard of anybody that's read it either. <SEP> No. I think it was on the best-seller list though for a while. Well it wouldn't surprise me. <SEP>
