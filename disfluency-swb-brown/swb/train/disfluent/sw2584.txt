Okay. Do you go camping very much? No. I've haven't gone camping in years. But it's is something that I've done in the past. How about you? Uh we try to go once maybe twice a summer. Uh we uh just you know for like a short weekend or something. <SEP> That's that's pretty average to me. We don't go for the long you know week long thing. Uh-huh. But we usually go to uh a lake area you know where the campsites are and do that. Uh. <SEP> Right. Do you tent camp. Or do you have a camper? Oh no. No. No. A tent. <SEP> That's what I ha- you know. That's how I camp too. That's how I define camping. Me too. You're really roughing it. The rest the rest of that is re- really not the same. Yeah. <SEP> As a matter of fact my my you know the majority of the amount of camping I've done has been really roughing it. Um as a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother. And we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota. So that's that's really wild. Oh. Yeah. Are you here in local Texas. I mean? <SEP> Yes. I'm in Austin. Where are you? I'm in Garland. Oh. Right outside of Dallas. <SEP> Uh-huh. So we um we have a five year old. And we started taking her she was pretty young when we started uh camping with her. Oh the kids love it. I know. <SEP> I mean they just love it. It's wonderful for them to be outside. I know. And then they and they you know. There's no T V. And they don't have all these modern toys. And they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with. Exactly. <SEP> Yes. And I like that. It's pretty fun. Well how it. It's really is a is a good good family thing to do. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And. We we try to uh go with another couple that have children also. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh that makes it a lot more enjoyable. Plus you know we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff you know. We kind of split it up. Uh. Good planning. Yeah. Because it gets it really does get expensive if you if you don't want to rough it all the way. <SEP> Exactly. You know even the sleeping bags those are running you know a good thirty dollars a pop. And and so we've built that up. You're right. But. <SEP> Do you have a boat? No. No? Want one bad. Do you? <SEP> Oh well actually I would you know what I would love? I would absolutely love a sail boat. Oh. That doesn't go along with camping. But now that that that's what I would like to have. Yes. <SEP> Yeah. I would too. <SEP> Yeah. Would too. We usually. Uh let's see. We try to go to a lake. My husband and this uh other couple that we go with her husband um kind of likes um is it scuba dive? And so we'll go to a lake and uh where they can go do that. Uh-huh. We're close enough so they can do that. And the girls can play on the beach area. <SEP> And I would play on the beach area too. Yeah. That's what I would do. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That's fun. I'm just sitting here list- listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that. Really? Am I pretty Texan? <SEP> You're pretty Texan. Yes. But you know you know what's really funny? Um I've had people tell me that I have a Texas accent. And and I mean there is just no way I've not picked one up. No. You don't you don't sound like it to me. <SEP> I've only lived here about six years. Oh have you? So i- i- if I have one it must be very very slight. Yeah. <SEP> The Yankees can hear it. Yes. Oh that's true. That's true. I see I don't think I do. But uh but a lot of people do say I sound like. I guess I have I guess more of a twang to my voice. Uh-huh. <SEP> Are you a a native Texan? I sure am. Oh. I've lived here all my life. <SEP> Well good for you. But any way uh. Have you ever been to Austin? Yes. Yes. We went last summer actually. <SEP> This. How was. I'm wondering I'm really not that not familiar. I know there are some good places to go camping along the uh the lakes. Or is there? Okay. Well we didn't go camping. We just uh we did like uh we drove down to Houston to visit friends. And we went to Galveston and uh to San Antonio and then up to Austin. And and kind of uh you know doing the sight seeing type stuff. Uh-huh. So we didn't go camping. That would be fun though to go. That's one thing my husband wanted to do was on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went. And I said Well I'd love that. But. <SEP> It takes a lot more planning. It does. And and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week-long vacation I want to be a little bit pampered you know by a hotel and a waiter. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So we're hoping to do like a three day weekend. There's um a thing called Pfeiffer Rim. I don't know if you have ever heard of it? <SEP> No. I haven't. It's uh there's a town called Glenrose. I think it's around two hours from here. And uh it's it has like dinosaur tracks and stuff like that. Oh that sounds That sounds great. And it's got one of those wildlife parks. <SEP> Yeah. I think that'll be fun. So we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there. And. Have you ever camped out of state? No. I haven't. <SEP> You know where you should try sometime is Colorado. Where at? It is beautiful. Is it? <SEP> Absolutely beautiful. I've just been up there skiing. And well we've driven through and you know but but not you know camping or anything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I would love to camp in the mountains. Yes. <SEP> Estes State Park is fantastic. That's what my girlfriend says. Yes. She loves that place. See you need to go there. She loves that. She says that where we need to go sometime. <SEP> It is. It's you know it's it's high canyon. And uh and there's this little mountain lakes. And it's very peaceful. Oh. And um in in the early fall time. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um I can't remember what type of trees they are. But they all the leaves turn yellow. Oh. And it's just brilliant. And. I love that. <SEP> Yes. You would. You'd like it very much. That's neat. That's neat. I know you would. I used to go camping all the time as a a Girl Scout. <SEP> I was too. All the time. I got real used to it then. Yeah. I felt like we roughed it then. <SEP> Uh well we did you know. We really did. I mean I just don't understand these people that think taking an R V and parking it and sitting inside and watching T V and having your microwave. Right. Yes. <SEP> Exactly. It's not camping. I mean we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything. <SEP> Right. Right. I mean that is it. You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping. Right. <SEP> Oh. Yeah. Well do you you you say you haven't been in years? No. I haven't. I'm um I'm a struggling single mom. Oh gosh bless your heart. <SEP> And uh. Thank you. Um it's you know. Time is precious. Money's precious. Yes. <SEP> Um and i- i- it it. I think I haven't been able to do it. And you know what that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my children you know again. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And th- I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women. I don't blame you. <SEP> You know? I don't blame you at all. I hope. Years ago it would have been fine. But. <SEP> Yes. I I really now n- n-. I I have gone on one little vacation just the girls and I. We drove down to Port Aransas and rented a little efficiency you know and and had a marvelous like two nights. Oh. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And that was great. And even at that it it was like the first time that I ventured you know out of the city by myself. Uh-huh. <SEP> And and you know I I stayed in a nice place. But it's still it's real different not to have another adult with you. Yes. I kn-. You know. I can imagine. <SEP> I'm just a chicken. I know lots of women would do it all the time. No. I don't blame you not nowadays. <SEP> I haven't quite adjusted you know? Yeah. Now are you with T I down there? Well I I was with T I until January. I uh I left T I in January hoping to strike out and find a job where I could make some money. Good. <SEP> So well it's It was a good plan but I haven't yet. Have you? Okay. <SEP> I got into sales. And I'm selling uh telephone systems. Oh. Oh that's neat. <SEP> And it's it's fun. And it's interesting. But it's also um pretty challenging. And I haven't I haven't started making money yet. Um. It's hard isn't it? So yeah. It's it's hard. Now how old are your girls? <SEP> Eleven and fourteen. Oh goodness. Yeah. So I'm old. No. You're not old. <SEP> You're not old at all.
