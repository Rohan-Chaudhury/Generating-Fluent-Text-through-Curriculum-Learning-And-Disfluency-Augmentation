Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel. And then I'll respond. All right. Well I'm uh I'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling I'm afraid. We um recently moved here from North Carolina. And they had curbside recycling. And it was very easy to you know to put everything out there. But we don't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now. Yeah. <SEP> And uh so I've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where take things where they belong. Well how long have you been here? Well we've been here since January. So we we still feel very new. Well. <SEP> But uh it's working up to a year now. Yeah. So I guess we're old timers compared to some people. Yeah. I think that's a good excuse. You need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things. <SEP> Right. Yeah. We've been here probably two and a half years. And and we didn't recycle at all before we came. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I think we're doing well. We we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well where do you take those things? Well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart. They have um in behind Walmart they have bins. Uh-huh. And then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money. <SEP> Well where do you do that. Because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um. Uh-huh. But I didn't know where to take them. Um there's a place on Parker Road um. It's just over the overpass before you get like to K-Mart. I think there's a a service station there. There's usually a semi truck that has a a person there that will weigh them. And Now they aren't worth much right now. <SEP> Oh. But it's better than nothing. Yeah. So. <SEP> Better than nothing. Right. And what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now. And we hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October. Yeah. I. It seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that you know it's coming in a couple of months. Yeah. And I think it's been delayed. <SEP> But. I think it was originally scheduled for February. But the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with from what I've read in you know the mail that we get. Oh. <SEP> Right. And I can't wait for that. That will be easy. I get tired of newspaper littering the garage. Yeah. It gets to be a bit much to haul it off. But. I feel guilty we don't recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste. <SEP> Well they yeah they they're a lot of bulk anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They fill up the whole kitchen garbage can. <SEP> Right. So I'll be glad when the bins do come. And I think that's when I'll I'll start doing the plastic too. Yeah. It was real easy with the bins. It really was. It was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage. So um. Yeah. I've gotten used to washing the you know the um salad dressing bottles and things like that. <SEP> Right. It's not that big of a deal. And it's nicer to just throw them out. But we can do our part take an extra minute or two. Yeah. <SEP> Well how much do you earn on the cans. I I didn't know ho- what kind of an idea to give her for. Oh when we first were were here it was like we'd take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full. Uh-huh. And it would be like two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar. <SEP> Yeah. So it's gone down. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Which is understandable. I think more people are are recycling. Right. <SEP> Yeah. That's something we we don't really make any effort to. And whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans. Uh-huh. And that was kind of fun. But we haven't done that for a long time. <SEP> Yeah. So. Well that sounds like a pretty good project. Well the boys think it's fun plus you get your exercise. And you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest. <SEP> So. <SEP> Oh. But. Well I'll have to keep myself and and ge- get on it. My neighbor across the street um is so careful about recycling. And so I keep telling myself I'll I'll get it organized. But may maybe they'll beat me and and do the city wide first. Well hopefully the bins will be here in this month. And that will spur you on. So. <SEP> Right. Right. I won't have any excuse then. That's for sure. All right well it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting Trying. Thinking about it anyway. That's all you can do. <SEP> Yeah. But Well um have you. So. Do they time this thing for us. Or do we. Um yeah. You can do it as long as you want. They you know. If it's been long enough five minutes is is when they cut in and say say we don't have any more room for recording. <SEP> You can't chat all day huh. So we can say good-bye now. Okay. It was good talking to you. And maybe we'll get on line again. <SEP> Okay. Thanks Sherry. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
