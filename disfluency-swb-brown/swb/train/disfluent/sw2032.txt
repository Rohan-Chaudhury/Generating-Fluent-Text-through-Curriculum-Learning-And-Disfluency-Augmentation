Okay. So we've got to talk about music. Okay. And um do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind? <SEP> Oh I guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because that's Well no that's really when I grew up. No. Not a seventies baby. So that's really what I like better. Is that kind of music. I mean. Is it disco. Or is it like. <SEP> No. No. No. Not that kind of music. But. No. More like uh rock um you know like Led Zepplin type. Oh okay. So so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin. <SEP> Right. Yeah. That's cool. Right. And how about the Rolling Stones? <SEP> Oh sure. Sure. I went to their concert last year when they were here. Oh that's when that's when they took toured. How about um Pink Floyd? Sure. Yeah. I like them. Okay. So so then we got we got some same things. Because. <SEP> Okay. Well I just didn't know that much about music. And I wasn't sure what kind of music. No. It's very hard. Because see well I mean in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen you know. I listen to heavy metal or classic rock. What what kind of heavy metal are we talking about? What. We're talking about what they what they call hard rock. <SEP> Okay. Like give me some examples. Like for example let's see uh Bad Company. What. Oh well Bad Cam- Company's not bad. That's not. Well they're like for example A C D C. <SEP> Yeah. A C D C. Why. Have you heard of them? Yes. Okay. And stuff like that. That's that's that's not really hard rock. <SEP> Well okay. Okay. I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal. Okay. <SEP> I mean I I think when you say heavy metal I'm I'm thinking about like Cinderella you know. Well Cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal. Well see I don't really care for Cinderella. But I like A C D C's okay. But see for example they have see what. But other bands consider it like really hard rock. It's like brash metal which all they do is like they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar. And the guitar is set like really low. <SEP> Yeah. No. I don't really care for that too much I guess. And what happens is like oh everybody gets like totally into the music. And then they start dancing around. Uh-huh. And they just bump into each other. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like like they hit each other with their shoulders. Uh-huh. And then you knock people down. And what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people. <SEP> Is that the kind of music that you like? No. I don't like that music. Oh okay. But that's that's what they do. That's that's what some people call like really heavy metal. <SEP> Oh okay. And see the difference I guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also. Like really like heavy metal wo- is considered like the words heavy metal. And like you always thought about like suicide. And killing people and stuff like that. Yeah. And just hard rock has. They they don't talk about that. They just talk about like life in general. <SEP> Right. Like Queen's Reich if you ever heard of them. Oh sure. Of course. Yeah. <SEP> Que- you you're talking Queen. Is that what you said? Okay. Well no. I said Queen's Reich. But but oh but you got to like Queen also. Oh oh oh okay. <SEP> Right. So because. Well sure. Because Queen was real popular when I was growing up. Yeah. Especially uh oh God what is it A Night At The Opera? Don't they have a. No. Let's see the one that they have the the whole opera singing in the background. <SEP> Oh !. Um uh Right. Bo Bo Bohemian Rhapsody. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That that was great. I heard that the other day on the radio. And I pumped it up. <SEP> Because I mean I just love that song. Yeah. That that was a real good one. Yeah. But they had. That that whole record was pretty good. But then they started going downhill like everybody else. <SEP> Well that's true. They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that. Yeah. They're they're still around. They've got a ne- new C D out. But I I wouldn't buy it. Because see what happens is the old see whe-. I like I like the old Rolling Stones. I don't like the new stuff. Of the Stones? Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I agree. That's the ne-. The older stuff is the best of it. The the new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which I don't really care for today's rock and roll too much. Yeah. Well for example I used to like old Phil Collins. <SEP> Right. An old Genesis? Yes. Definitely. I agree. And and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey I can make money a lot of money doing this. And then he came out with uh see for example his his record like No Jacket Required. <SEP> Uh-huh. That was good. But it was on his way of going downhill. Because he said I can make a lot of money just singing alone. And then he came out with the Invisible Touch with uh Genesis. And that really. Like now I hate Phil Collins. I can't stand him. Right. Because I look at him. And I say you know you were singing at this time and with these people. And you were great. And now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you what you sing or what you record. It's still going to be a number one hit. And so that's that's what gets me mad. <SEP> Yeah. But did did you go see that new Doors movie? No. Not yet. I guess I've been con- kind of considering it. Have you seen it yet? Yeah. I saw it when it opened. <SEP> Was it really good? Yeah. Well it it's you know it's like I was watching Siskel and Ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies? Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And they both loved the movie right? Uh-huh. They said the music's great. It took me back to the sixties and stuff like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then one of them said well everything is great. But I'm going to give it thumbs down. And they go. But why? Because it's like the end is like really depressing. And so. Oh. But it but it's like the movie is so well made. And the music that goes with it just picks you up see. I was never I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine. <SEP> Oh okay. So I mean so for me. So you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then. No. But you learn to. I mean it's just that like the the sixties music's got a lot to say. <SEP> Right. I I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too. You know I was like. Well no. Now well seventies music I mean I'm like I said yo- disco I don't like disco. I've never liked disco. Hey. But I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants. <SEP> Well that's true. That's true. But I was more in the late seven-. Well I shou-. Like mid to late seventies like between seventy-five and and seventy-nine was more my era. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Did did you go to college? Well no. I'm going right now. Oh that's cool. <SEP> But uh no. I didn't go then. But see I graduated high school in seventy-eight. Okay. So you know in seventy-eight you know rock was starting to get really heavy you know. And real um I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Disco was pretty much dead by then. Yeah. So so that's what I mean. Disco wasn't really my time. Well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in in progression ever in history. So. <SEP> About music? No. About everything. Oh. Okay. So it's like nothing happened during the seventies. Everything happened during the sixties. The seventies I don't know what they're called you know. It's like like. The the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or you know like the technology years because of all the computers and stuff. <SEP> Uh-huh. But the seventies got nothing. I mean nobody cared to name it. That's kind of funny. So. <SEP> You're right. I never thought of that. The disco years that's what they're calling them are gone. Yeah. I know. Can you imagine the like a big picture of John Travolta ta-da what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER? Him just standing there. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's a good example to look for in history. Well from now on we're going to go from the from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties. Okay. What happened in the middle? Don't worry. Don't worry. You're not you're not missing anything you know. So. That's true. Well except for Vietnam. Yeah. Really. And that's that's why I guess everybody. <SEP> You know with. Yeah. It's like they don't want to talk about that. So they just don't name it. I mean it was it was I guess it was pretty bad times. Yeah. Well that's very true. But. Oh well let's see. Yeah. Okay. We've been talking for seven minutes. So. <SEP> Oh good. I haven't even been keeping track. Okay. All right. So um I'm going to leave you alone. Uh what what are you doing? Do you have a family? Uh yeah. Okay. <SEP> We're kind of I was kind of in the middle of supper. But it's not a big deal. Oh I'm sorry. I just left it. No. It's okay. Because see I didn't see. Somebody tried to call me last night. But I didn't have my number yet. I just got it today. Oh okay. <SEP> And so you know it's okay. I I told them I'd be available during this time. So anyway. Okay. All right. So then uh have fun doing this. It is not that bad. <SEP> Okay. Thanks. Bye bye. Great. Bye.
