All Right. Ladies first. Oh no. Well I don't find a lot of time to watch T V. And a lot of time I find it during the day when when I'm rocking my little girl to sleep. So I watch a lot of reruns old shows Like DICK VAN DYKE all those old crazy shows. <SEP> Barney Fife I guess. Yeah. I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH. Well some-. So you're a homemaker? <SEP> Yeah. I guess that's the right term nowadays. Yeah. I guess so. Yeah. I am. I stay home with two kids. Yeah. My wife. We have a new one in the house. And she stays home too also. <SEP> Huh-uh. Um I guess I have a wide variety. I like watching the T V for things that are interesting. Not so much the bor- things that aren't. For example like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time and DIFFERENT STROKES. Huh-uh. But I like SIXTY MINUTES PRIME TIME LIVE. <SEP> Huh-uh. Of course I have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning but not the NINJA TURTLES. I like the old-timey ones TOM AND JERRY. <SEP> Yeah. You sound like my husband. There you go. He likes TOM AND JERRY and uh BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS. And all those guys. Right. <SEP> JOHNNIE QUEST. The good ones. Yeah. Um now if I'm ever home during the during the day on a vacation day I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW because I usually because he's just he's one of my idles. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And then uh but I don't know. It seems like nowadays everything is so electronic you know magnified and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings. <SEP> Huh-uh. Huh-uh. And so uh now I do with the COSBY SHOW. I have seen it a couple of times. And I do. I like the show. I just don't watch it. Because of the timing. <SEP> Yeah. But uh some of the crap that's on T V nowadays it's about. Yeah. I do watch the special shows that they come out with the NOVA stuff. And and the nature shows. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I think there's enough out there to pick from. I'm not. We don't have cable to the point of of the H B O or any of that stuff. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. But uh. Well I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children. Because with two kids. Huh-uh. <SEP> And you know I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch. Or I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN. Sure. Oh me. <SEP> And I watched that for like oh ten or fifteen straight years. Oh no. And then I had well you know I'd eat. Like at work we'd have a T V or whatever. And then um as my kids got older and started you know recognizing what was going on I thought this isn't really very good. <SEP> So I gave it up. Ouch. Fifteen years. Yeah. Bet they hated that. <SEP> I watched I had watched it since it started. So. Oh goodness. Uh now I I don't know who the characters are. And um I'll turn it on every once in awhile. And I don't recognize anybody. So I guess that's a good sign. Yeah. Really. I used to watch uh. I can recall. This might age me date me here uh. I can remember staying home when I was five and six and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT. <SEP> Huh-uh. Oh yeah. Well see you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the SECRET STORM and the EDGE OF NIGHT. SECRET STORM. <SEP> Well I think they were back to back and black and white. Huh-uh. <SEP> Huh-uh. I was just a youngster. And I was like oh my gosh. Yeah. We used to. My mother watched all that stuff too. And AS THE WORLD TURNS. I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may still on or not. Still be on. <SEP> It was not too long ago. Yeah. Now they got a lot of other crap involved. And so. Yeah. You're right. I think some of the tones of the the daily prime time is questionable. <SEP> Yeah. And that could be uh. I have to agree with you. Yeah. You know keep them on the channel eleven channel twenty one. The nature stuff you know. <SEP> Right. Yeah. We do. And it's real interesting too the difference in my kids. Like um my oldest loved SESAME STREET And those kind of shows. Huh-uh. <SEP> My younger one doesn't. She's more into WALT DISNEY kind you know. We watch a lot of movies that we've got on V C on tapes and stuff. Huh-uh. She's more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing. So But um we do a lot of kid watching. Huh-uh. <SEP> Well sounds like you got your hands full there. And I do appreciate speaking with you. Sure. It was fun. Have you gotten your catalog yet? <SEP> No. I don't think so. Yeah. I just spoke with Jim. I just got my in the mail. And it inspired me to make more phone calls. Oh well see I don't really. I've had a few people call me. But I've never made one. Oh really. <SEP> Yeah. I need to get brave. Yeah. Give them your pen number. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I need to do. Have a good day. <SEP> Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
