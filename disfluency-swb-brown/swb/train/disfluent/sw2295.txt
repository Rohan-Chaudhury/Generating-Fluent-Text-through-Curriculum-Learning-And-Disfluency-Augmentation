All right. Well on this subject I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet. But my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home. Uh-huh. So I've always been involved you know in one. <SEP> How do you feel about them I mean since you've kind of been close to that. Well I've Well I can kind of see both sides you know. I really can. Uh nursing homes to me. I would personally be the last resort you know I rea- you know if I had to put someone in there. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well I've had a touch of experience. My um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him. Yeah. If it's a have to thing. Yeah. I. Yeah. <SEP> And uh she put him in. But he wasn't there very long before he died. Uh-huh. But um I guess um the one time that I saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay. Uh-huh. <SEP> But um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> And that's always kind of bothered me. Yeah. Well I kind of think that's true too. I guess because it's so under staffed you know. Uh-huh. That's like everything else though. <SEP> I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home. But I've never actually been there. Uh-huh. And I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. But. But still I'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I know. I've always. Well my sister's involved in one also. And I really think they really do a wonderful job. But still there's those little things that happens you know. <SEP> Yeah. There really is which. I think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that you know if you just can't take care of them any more. Well sometimes you don't have any other alternative. Uh-huh. That's it. <SEP> Family and friends are usually well family's tied up with their own lives and things and usually working. Uh-huh. Other things. <SEP> And it's hard to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I think when the time comes I I hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. I think that's important too. In fact there's a. I do too. <SEP> Outside's awful deceiving sometimes you know. Yes. <SEP> There's one close to where my mother is. But in order to get in you have to be able to um walk in on your own. In other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> But then if you deteriorate um they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time. Ca-. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> But it's always well. And they have a long waiting list too. So there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door. So you can't wait until you're too bad off. Off. Yeah. But then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever. To. No. <SEP> Uh-huh. And everything you worked so hard for all your life. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> And if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee I'm you know I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's kind of a that's a hard one. But it is a very nice nursing home. Now there is some really nice ones. There's also you know some private ones you know. Uh-huh. But of course I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know. <SEP> Yeah. That's the problem. That's way out of my reach. The expense of it all is. And uh what I another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately. Oh yeah. <SEP> But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care. You know. Uh-huh. The very same. Yeah. <SEP> So I don't like that aspect. No. But I there's I think there's ways around it though that you know. Like they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know. Yeah. But still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that. You know it's their money. <SEP> That's right. You know that's how I feel about it anyway. Well yeah. I've talked to my mother about that several times lately. And I I said I want you to have control of your own business. Yes. <SEP> But you know what if. Yeah. My mother's seventy now. So naturally she's retired. But she's still on her own I mean. Yeah. Yeah. My mother's uh seventy-five and still has her own home and everything. I think that's wonderful. I really do. Just as long as they can. And then on the other hand I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. They have a lot of people around to do things with. Uh-huh. They're not lonely. <SEP> Some of those places have wonderful activities and things you know lots of stuff going on. Oh yes. Uh-huh. And they'll take them places. Yeah. <SEP> So. I don't know. It's not all bad. No. But I guess once you get ill then you know you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things. Around. Yeah. <SEP> But I really don't know what the other solution would be you know. No. I really don't. But no. When the time comes I'm really hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents. <SEP> Uh-huh. Really do. Because I have been raised in one you know. So there's lot of things I know to look for. Yeah. And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either you know. <SEP> Yeah. I really don't. That might be kind of tough huh. It really would. Yes. Yes. And like I said my sister's still in it. And I really don't think my mother'd want to be there either. <SEP> Oh. Well it's been nice talking to you. Well you too. And I guess we'd better get back to work huh. <SEP> Okay. All right. Bye-bye. Bye.
