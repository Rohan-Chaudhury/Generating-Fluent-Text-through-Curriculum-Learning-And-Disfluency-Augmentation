Go ahead. Oh um uh I usually don't get to hea- hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh you know being uh. I mean by the time you get off work go by and pick up the uh baby from the baby sitter it's you know after six. And by the time everything is settled in. It's ten o'clock before I can catch up on anything. Yeah. I guess that's the way I am too. I sometimes I hear some things on on the radio. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. I only get the newspaper on the weekends. So. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. Oh I don't even have ge- time to read the newspaper except in passing. Uh-huh. You know I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on. I I guess occasionally I'll hear someone at work say something though. <SEP> But uh. Yeah. We have uh a news thing on the computer that uh that I'll I'll try to look at every day. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it it's pretty much headline news. Yeah. Which isn't you know pretty much what we loo- look for anyway. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh. I do you think that the quality of the uh the you know the news events that you get are. What do you think about it? Well I I guess it's pretty good. And and like the Dallas area. Uh-huh. And I I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this. There's I guess a lot of pressure in that business to borderline at that. <SEP> Yeah. Well you know there's a lot of competition in the media. Uh-huh. <SEP> And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines. And that they'll run a topic into the ground. Yeah. And uh. You know they try to play public's opinion. Which I think is awful because it usually works. Uh-huh. True. I'll bet that was the case of the the war in the Middle East. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. That. Uh l- lots of new uh newsmen were created during that. So it will be interesting to see what happens. Uh-huh. True. Trying to think what else is. Is current. <SEP> Right. Uh uh. Well um I don't know what to say. <SEP> Uh that's a bad one. They uh. Looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas. Yeah. I hate to see that. But it's uh i- that you know if what it's going to take. Well you know we can deduct that from our income tax our federal income tax. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh you know but we need good schools. Uh we're more involved in that now. And I I I I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools. Yeah. That's true. So. I would think they could find a better way to fund it though. But they haven't for. <SEP> No. You know I wish they could have gotten a lottery. Well they're struggling with it. Yeah. I think you know the lottery could have helped with that. I mean it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax. I mean probably would have paid the same amount. But you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax. Uh-huh. True. <SEP> So. I I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that. No. It'll be interesting to see what happens. Trying to think what else is current. <SEP> I you know I haven't seen the news in a couple of days. So it uh. I'm a little behind on things. Well the other thing I can think of is uh what is still going on in Iraq and the Kurd refugees. Yes. That's that's sad. <SEP> Yeah. They uh yeah they had to choose between the better of the two two bad situations. And uh I don't know what I've would have done in the situation. Uh-huh. Yeah. It begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and finish the job while we were in there. <SEP> Yeah. Right. But I understand why Bush you know doesn't want to go in and and uh take sides. I mean because that would definitely look like another Korea. Uh-huh. <SEP> And he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though I'd agree with it. I think he ought to should've gone in there and blew them away. Seems to have helped him though popularity wise. Yeah it it it did a lot. <SEP> He did a real good job I believe. I have uh in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too. Hm. It uh it uh you know. We so we kept very much abreast of what was going on. Yeah. Were were they in any of the areas where they some of the Scuds? <SEP> Yeah. They were on the the ne- near uh Dahran. On the on the wes- east coast. Um. <SEP> Um-hum. Yeah. <SEP> They were just north of it. Probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from uh the Kuwaiti border. Um. Uh and they stayed active was the uh the military there. Taking supplies out to them in the desert. Uh-huh. <SEP> It was it was a new situation. Yeah. I'll bet. I don't really have much more to say. I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather. And. <SEP> You're right. And that's that's awful in Texas. Have have you all been getting rain storms down there? We got some awful rain uh the other morning. And today's just been real drizzly. We did we did last night. Uh some real massive thunderstorms. <SEP> Yeah. Apparently I I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too. Uh-huh. Caused some damage. <SEP> It did? We may get some more tonight. Oh well. We we've just got slight chances of rain. But uh we had the we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning. Course while everybody was getting ready to go to work. Making nice traffic jams. So. Uh-huh. Well the the ground here is so flat. And it's all saturated now. <SEP> Oh. We're getting some flooding. Right. Uh when was it last week we had all the rain? But uh. We I think we had about eight inches. Hm. <SEP> It was between six and eight inches here where we are. Goodness. And uh it you walk out on the ground. I mean you. I mean it's awful. It's just so soggy. Yeah. It's a lot more humid down that way. <SEP> Yeah. In fact miserable. Well today it was I mean the air was just so sticky so damp. Yeah. I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time like an hour or so just a bunch. <SEP> Goodness. Well I guess that's it. Right. Well it's. That's about as much as we can do with current events. <SEP> Right. Well it was nice talking to you. Good talking to you Michelle. All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
