All righty. Uh I'll just hand it off to you. And hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today. Well uh the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time are crafts. And uh I've been involved in making uh hat stands and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with uh flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff. Oh. <SEP> And I enjoy it. It's relaxing. And you kind of get absorbed in it. So the time goes by you know before you realize anything is going on. And I play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction. Not for anybody else's ears. Because I'm not that good at it. But I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while. Oh really? How about yourself? Well oh hobbies gee whiz. I guess I got too many hobbies. So I never have time to deal with them. <SEP> Really? I like photography a lot. Oh yeah. That's neat. Uh I used to do that a lot. And then I like um. We have a new child that will be a year old here next week. So I'll take a lot of pictures of her you know and spoil them. <SEP> Oh that's great. Uh-huh. First one you know how that is. And um uh I play the guitar and a banjo. I mainly play the guitar a lot. I play about every night. And um I really love that. If I had a druther. If I could have if I could make it on the road I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something. Because that's. I've. Oh that sounds nice. I like bluegrass too. Yeah. I've done it before and when I was in hi- in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it's really a a blast. My wife hates it. But that's the way life is I guess. That's the hard part right? Exactly. <SEP> If you can do things together that really helps a lot. Yeah. We uh. She's uh into aerobics. And uh and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half. Oh that's good too. And that went over real well. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh that's about it there. Oh it's good. And it's healthy too. Oh yeah. Yeah. <SEP> We do that too. We have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff. We try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know. Oh that's great. Yeah. That's great. <SEP> And we like movies. That ki-. Yeah. Yeah. That's uh. Spare time. With a child it's kind of stra-. She's. We have uh. We're looking for a baby-sitter. So we've been out twice in o- in this year so far. By ourselves without the child. Uh-huh. So it's kind of uh become an issue you could say. <SEP> Sure. Um hobbies. I like messing around in your house building things and you know putting cabinets up and those kind of things um. Oh yeah. That's great too. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. We did some remodeling when we bought a house. We built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering. That's fun. It's really kind of fun. <SEP> It is. It really is. Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I like things that you know two people can do. But I like the quiet of doing things away you know. Kind of gives you some space for yourself. And that's what I find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that I can create. And I like to crochet and knit. I made some afghans and that kind of stuff. I like doing things with my hands. Uh-huh. Sounds like it. <SEP> Yeah. Do you like to cook? Yes. I love to cook. Yeah. I love to cook too.

There's uh there's pluses to everything. <SEP> Oh yeah. But you know seems like there's just so many things to do down here. I like the sports. I play a lot of racquetball. We did I did horseback riding too. In fact when my children were growing up we always had horses. And uh that was kind of for them. But they weren't as interested in it as we were you know. So uh that was a real. I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know. We always had horses around. And I really enjoyed that. Oh that's great. Sounds like you. <SEP> And I was disappointed when I went to Texas. I didn't see that many of them. Horses? Yes. Yeah. You really don't. Yeah. Th- the. You have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete uh. <SEP> I know. I know. It's true. There's buildings and concrete and a lot of people. And that's about it down here. And so.
