Okay. What um. Do you watch much T V. Or you know. Um no. I don't watch much T V. Sometimes um usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news. The news. Yeah. <SEP> But I don't think of that every day even. Uh-huh. Um I think I get most of my current events. Well I get them from everywhere. I sometimes watch T V if I. I guess I watch T V if I haven't read the paper that day. We don't get a paper. But I work um at a. I teach a college class. And uh. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> There's a. The library has a paper. And so I often drop in on a break and and read it. Yeah. And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home. Uh-huh. <SEP> And then I I figure if there's big big news I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know. Yeah. Yeah. Now I also. I get it from all over. I watch the news every day. And I ha- we have a news. You know we get the newspaper and uh um magazines an- anything. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know I'm. I read a lot. So I get. Um you know I'm I'm really up on uh current affairs. I get you know the news and and everything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. What's your favorite news. Do you get a news magazine. Or. Um well I'm not getting an-. No. I'm not getting any news magazines. Uh-huh. But um you know as as I said I do. It's uh it's easy to keep up on current event- you know on cert- you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. We've got. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And uh. <SEP> Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage? Uh I don't know. Is there anything missing? I you know. Yeah. It's kind of hard to know. And I don't know you know what what's I mean what are we supposed to uh compare it to you know I mean the quality uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Whatever they tell you. You know I uh I guess I I you know I'm satisfied. I mean I. Uh you know they they're supposedly covering everything that happens. So. Yeah. Yeah. You know. <SEP> Well I do feel like a little bit like. Being from California and wanting to hear like. I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something. And. Oh really? I don't ever hear it in the news here. Oh. <SEP> Um. Well uh sometimes it's such a. You know it's it's so um slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. But most of the ti- the times I find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it. Yeah. But uh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I sometimes feel like um the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS um the top headlines are always a murder you know. Oh well. That's what sells papers. That that's because there's a high crime rate. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's um that's been like that since they the first newspaper you know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. You know but um I don't know. I I guess I'm satisfied. I don't uh. Uh-huh. I mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really? <SEP> Yeah. Really. We don't get a you know. That's true. We certainly get enough coverage. I mean we we can get news. You know I mean there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day. Oh yeah. I was going to. <SEP> Sure. Yeah. Sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad. Yeah. It's all so negative you know. <SEP> Yeah. Often times. But. So. Yeah. Well we have to keep talking I guess. <SEP> Well no. I guess we can end. Oh. Yeah. It's just whenever we're um. Oh is it really? <SEP> Yeah. Have you always gone until the recording? Well yeah. I don't I don't uh. Uh-huh. I guess we're not supposed to. I don't know. We're sup- I guess we're supposed to wait. <SEP> Or I don't know. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Becau- I. You know like one uh well. Was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening. Uh-huh. Uh and it was really funny. I I I mixed it made the call. And it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away. <SEP> Oh really. Yeah. And it was really. We were laughing. I mean. But you know we don't really do any gardening. So like that took like a minute. Uh-huh. And then we just talked about you know whatever I mean. <SEP> Uh-huh. Interesting. Yeah. You know I mean some topics. Really now you know now this topic this is I mean. There really isn't much to say after you know you uh you know you you tell the person what uh news there uh you know where their where they find their sources of information from. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And then you know if it's uh if they're satisfied. And that's about it really. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's hard to talk for five minutes on this. Yeah. So um. <SEP> Yeah. Well I guess I can just say I it bothers me that I hear a lot about um you know on the news that. Well it seems like I don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um. You know you'll hear one report. And then you'll hear that it you know they didn't um.
