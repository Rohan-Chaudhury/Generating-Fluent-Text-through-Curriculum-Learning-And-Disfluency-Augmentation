Well what kind of vacations do you like to take? Well we've uh we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe. So. So I I guess those are the types I like. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. We've really enjoyed them. Yeah. Where have you gone there? <SEP> We've gone to um Germany Switzerland Austria Ireland and England. Uh-huh. We've been to Germany twice. Uh-huh. <SEP> But um I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well I've been over there too. Uh-huh. Where have you been? I even. Let's see um. Mostly Germany and France. <SEP> Uh-huh. I lived in France for a year and a half. So I was able. Oh how neat. But I once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany. <SEP> Uh-huh. Because uh I've got relatives there. And I just like it there. Oh that's neat. <SEP> Uh-huh. So but um Austria I found really pretty and Switzerland. Uh-huh. Yeah. And I I lived in the Alps in France. So I anything in the mountains over there I just love. <SEP> Oh how neat. Oh yeah. Then I finally made it to England too uh on my way home um. I lived in Africa actually. And on my way home from there. <SEP> You lived in Africa? Yeah. Oh my goodness. Yeah. <SEP> Wow. So um and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from Nairobi you have to fly through um uh Europe on your way home. Uh-huh. So I went to England. And I really liked it there too. <SEP> It's so expensive over there. I know. It's true. That's the one thing. <SEP> It really is. It just it's it's. I love to go over there. But it's so darn expensive to go over. Yeah. Yeah. Actually now you can get some really good deals flying over. But it's. <SEP> Yeah. Once you're there you still have to spend money. Unless you know people you know. Oh I know. Just. <SEP> Right. Then you can stay with them. And yeah. Uh-huh. That helps a lot. <SEP> Yeah. But. You know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know I'd like to go to Hawaii some time. And and uh we made it. Yeah. We've we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. So. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Feel like we've accomplished a little bit here. I haven't. I've been I've. Most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast. Uh-huh. Or this summer I went to Colorado. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I'd love to go to the East Coast during the Fall. The oh the. It's oh. I've always wanted to go there. I've seen pictures. And and it looks gorgeous. Yeah. <SEP> We um we made a trip up the East Coast. It was uh in the summer. Uh-huh. And it really is pretty. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's uh. Both coasts are really pretty. Yeah. But um I love the Carolinas. It's just gorgeous over there. Uh-huh. I haven't been there anywhere on the East Coast. <SEP> Yeah. I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Well you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and and go over there. Yeah. I guess so. Yeah. But there's you know there's a lot to see here. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I just love going over to Europe because it's so their way of life is just so different than ours. Yeah. You know we're so fast paced here. And over there you know every time we'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. They're so leisurely over there. Yeah. <SEP> And it's kind of nice to to have that. Yeah. So the type of vacation you'd like um. Like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week? Well usually a bunch of different places. Yeah. Main- mainly probably because you want to see everything. <SEP> Right. See as much as you can while you're there. Yeah. Yeah. I know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. How did you like Africa? Well I liked it. I was working in Cameroon Africa. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it's not a it's not a place for tourists. I mean they're not used to having tourists there. So it's. Uh-huh. You're kind of roughing it. But um I liked it. I liked it. <SEP> Uh-huh. The people there are just very very friendly. And. What type of work? Um I was working with an organization that does Bible translation. <SEP> Oh okay. So I was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and uh what they call survey work. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Find out where the languages are. Uh-huh. So I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people. <SEP> Yeah. Um. That's neat. Yeah. I enjoyed it. So. <SEP> I've I've always um I've talked to people who have been to Africa. And they. And then of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out. Yeah. Um but I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there. Yeah. My cousin came over while I was there. And she came to Cameroon. And then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around you know close to Nairobi in Kenya. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh how neat. So she'd always dreamed of doing that too. <SEP> Yeah. That's great. So. Yeah. So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to? Uh. It sounds like we've been to some of the same places. <SEP> Yeah. It does.
