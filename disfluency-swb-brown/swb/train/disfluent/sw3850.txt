Okay. So what are your favorite shows? Um I like watching COLOMBO and um MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. QUANTUM LEAP? Uh-huh. <SEP> Did you see it the other night? Um uh-huh. That was that was pretty good. Yeah. That one was. What about. <SEP> What do you. With the psychic and everything? Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I like uh I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and uh HOME IMPROVEMENT. Oh I well I haven't seen either of those. <SEP> You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE? Huh-uh. Oh it's a great show. Um I also like to watch STAR TREK. But it's on so late here that I don't always get to see it. <SEP> Really? Yeah. We like it too. Have you seen the movie? Uh I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it. And they're you know already out with number six by now. But. So I haven't seen any of the movies yet. But I. Oh you haven't seen any of them. No. <SEP> Oh well they're good. They're real good. They're uh they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though. Uh-huh. Which ones are you watching the new ones? Yeah. I've seen quite a few of the older ones. I haven't seen really the new generation that much. <SEP> Oh okay. Yeah. Is there one you prefer better the older one or the youn- the newer one? Well they're they're a lot different. But I like I like the older ones because at that time you know they were really futuristic you know. Oh yeah. <SEP> And the newer ones are I guess the newer ones are real futuristic too. But I like I like both of them. Yeah. I do too. I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot. I mean he almost hates the new ones. Really? Yeah. Because he he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something. But I don't. <SEP> No. Not really. It's not really like a soap opera. Oh I think. Yeah. <SEP> But but it's. But that's true. I mean you you learn more about the characters and stuff. But that's the way all shows are now. Yeah. Sure. Well let's see. Um I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing. Yeah. That's sort of how Matlock is. But COLOMBO is way tricky. <SEP> Yeah. I mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them. Well it seems like they always show COLOMBO the same ones over and over though you know what I'm saying like that one where he goes to college. Well did you see the one. <SEP> Um. Or is this is there a series on. Um yeah. There's like one on. Well we see it Thursdays at seven. And it was. <SEP> Okay. This last time it was about this um movie director. Did you hap-. Yeah. I saw that one. Did you see that? <SEP> See that was a rerun. Really? Oh I guess I nev-. Yeah. I wondered if that's. Huh. <SEP> See I don't know if that's a the movie of the week or or what. But it seems like there's only about four or five different ones. And then then they keep showing them over and over. Oh I guess I've I haven't seen it before. He was a movie director. And he had that gal killed. Yeah. <SEP> Okay. Yeah. On the set or something. That was pretty good though. Yeah. It was. But yeah. I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things. <SEP> Uh-huh. But um there's no never anything good on Saturdays though. No kidding. I don't think so. Well STAR TREK'S on at five. But I'm never home. So. <SEP> What is it that. There's something I watch something I watch on Saturdays. And I can't remember what it is. Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS. Oh. You never saw that? I've heard of it a lot. I've heard of. A lot of people somehow or something. They'll say so and so from TWIN PEAKS or something you know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That was a different soap opera. Oh. But it was it was a different type of show. Uh-huh. <SEP> I didn't like the way it ended though. Oh did they end the whole series? Yeah. Oh. <SEP> Yeah. They didn't they only did it for I think two years. Oh. But it's all over now. Oh another show I like to watch is MASH.
