Hi. My name is Donna. And I'm calling calling from Plano Texas. I'm Jay in Dallas. Oh okay um. I um find exercise kind of a task I guess I'd say. I go to aerobics two days a week. But I also have three kids at home. So they keep me pretty busy. <SEP> That keeps you plenty of exercise. Yeah. That gives me plenty of exercise. But I enjoy um walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family. Excuse me. That's fine. And yourself. Well I uh I have. I walked and run ev- um almost every morning. I've sort of stopped here with the weather change. But uh it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning. Uh-huh. Every morning. Well my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing. <SEP> Oh that would. That's fantastic exercise. Yeah. He does it every day like a ritual. Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he um someone invites him to lunch he'll he'll not go. But he goes um every every day. And then he ru- he's a runner too. He runs three mornings a week. He gets up about five and and does his his deal. Um. And some days he doesn't. But then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run. <SEP> All right. And um we. I'd rather get a bicycle. But I have an ex- I had an exercise bike in the house but didn't seem to use it enough. So somebody sold it in a garage sale. And so uh but I'd like to get a bike and just do uh do biking outside. Oh. <SEP> The the the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here. And I know um uh we we both of my husband and I both do it to just keep the pounds off. We're getting up in age I guess in our late thirties. So we need to keep exercising just to be able to uh. Yeah. <SEP> It keeps going. Because I'm fifty-five. And it uh it just gets worse. You still want to eat. And uh but you just. Oh I know. I think you feel better too if you get on some program like that. But uh. Yeah. I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week. And I take my three year old with me. There's a nursery there. And it's kind of another day out for her to um have little friends. <SEP> Uh-huh. And um I I enjoy the socialization of it you know. Getting to see the same women every morning. Right. But um there are some parts during that exercise that I think I can not do another second of this. <SEP> Oh. I know it it it some of it is so tough. It is. <SEP> And uh especially when somebody's uh planning lunch for you and they know what what's good for you. I think when we do it ourselves. We take the easy way sometimes. That's true. That's true. So. Well. <SEP> So anyway. Okay well. Thank you for calling. Yes. Thank you for participating. <SEP> All right. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.
