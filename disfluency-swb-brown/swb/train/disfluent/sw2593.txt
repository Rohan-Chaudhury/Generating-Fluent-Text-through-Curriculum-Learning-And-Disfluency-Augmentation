So the the topic is hobbies. In your spare time. Yeah. Who has spare time? <SEP> Um I don't really don't really do any handicraft things like that. I used to. I used to do like salt ornaments and things. Uh-huh. But that was oh good many many years ago. And I have I really my spare time. <SEP> Yeah. I usually go do aerobics and read. And that's about it. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I understood that. I'm you know I work full time. And I have two kids. So my spare time usually involves something with the kids. Yeah. You know hobbies. We I I can't really say that we have hobbies. It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend. You know we like to go out go out. Yeah. <SEP> Family. Well well that's what I meant by salt that we we did that like as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season making them up for other people and things like that. Oh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. But as far as. Uh-huh. I've just never been very skilled at far you know needle work cloths. <SEP> Uh-huh. And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good. <SEP> And. I I guess mostly as far as as crafts go I've done um some needlepoint. I've done mostly cross stitching. I used to uh do like um. One that I did for both kids are like oh. They're plaques with you know different kind of animals. And then you have their birth date on them. Yeah. <SEP> And then you have a little picture of them. And you frame them and stuff. Uh-huh. But nothing steady. Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it. But you know it's nothing that I can really. It's not like you sit and knit every night. <SEP> No. Not at all. Yeah. I don't even know how to knit. And my mother used to knit you know all the time. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and I don't even know how to knit. I'm like that's a lost art from this family. <SEP> Yeah. So um. But it's not a very good topic. It feels like if you know. No. Not when you're n-. Neither one of us are really. I I have seen things I really like you know that were done especially like needlepoint. <SEP> Uh-huh. Needlepoint cushions and things. Yeah. But it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it you know and and that the petty point and things like that. <SEP> Yeah. It's like God it it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made. I don't know what what is. It's like there. But here a lot of the country stuff is in you know a lot of the woodwork a lot of uh stenciling. Yeah. <SEP> And you know you can go to any like a flea market and stuff. And there's just tons of stuff everywhere. And you know people just do it in their garage. Yeah. And then on weekends they go out and sell it. And during the week they go back and do some more. And see they do that as their job. Whereas you know for us it. <SEP> Right. And they make it cheaper for us to buy. Yeah. Definitely. So. But and I mean I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that. Because I can remember when I used to do you know those little salt those figurines and things. It was it was relaxing you know creative. You felt very creative. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it just was so time time involved you know so much time involved and the different steps and things. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. And. Okay. Well I think I think we're okay. I think we did the five minutes. So we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore. Yeah. So. <SEP> Okay. Well thank you. Okay. I hope you have a good rest of your weekend. Thanks. Bye-bye. Okay. Bye-bye.
