Okay um. Yeah. One year public service for everybody. Is that that was it right? Right. Uh who wants to start this one? Em-. I don't know. I've been I've been sitting here thinking. Yeah. Because it was you know took a couple tries before I found somebody. Well you know I'm like I'm not really sure what I think about this. Um uh I mean the first thing is the uh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory. I mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know. But you know senators' sons and all that stuff too. <SEP> Right. Right. I mean everybody's got to do it. Um I don't know. It'd probably be it'd probably be good. I just don't know if you know I was eighteen or whatever I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever. I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision. Uh I mean that that doesn't sound right. Um I guess I see overall beneficial if if we're going from that point of view. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um. I- you know in the past. I don't know I don't know how old you are. But when I was uh in high school it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth. And many of my peers were being drafted. Uh-huh. And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever. But I I felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways. Be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I guess I see that as as not so much a demand but but a privilege. It's it's kind of uh uh It's something. It is uh. It's it's. Since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest. I just see that as maybe a good idea. I wouldn't mind doing it at forty-four. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh and I find ways to to turn some of that back to to others. Uh and I I guess I I can't see that as being something to really object to. Well I guess it would still depend on how. I mean if if you're talking about any- if you're talking about something that's like a full time you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know. You're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff. I mean I you know I don't know. I could see a a full a run- a gamut of different kinds of opportunities. Things that need to be done that wou- that could be done in an hour or two uh a day or several hours of the week. Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that. In addition to what one does uh besides that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I can't imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time. Oh you're going to go to this camp. And you're going to you know. Like um back in the Depression the C C C the construction corps that went out and did things. That was great. Yeah. It was needed. It gave some folks some jobs. And we got some great public works out of it. But um I don't see that as being necessary now. I can see it being done uh on a regular schedule. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps. Uh-huh. Uh I I guess I see all of us benefiting. And I I don't see it just relegated to the young. But I see I I see so much going on that that's bad. And this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem. Uh-huh. <SEP> Something that they turn back. Well. And also you know you you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something in it. <SEP> That's right. You take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I I see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives. Uh definitely. It might not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then you're you're coming in contact with it. It's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that I'll never be able to see again unless I happen to go on vacation up there. Right. <SEP> Yeah. It's it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going. Yeah. <SEP> But as far as putting that into work I don't want to I don't want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics of it. Oh that would be a nightmare. And just I mean just getting getting it going. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I I see a lot of things like uh scouting uh Boys Clubs Girls Clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I guess I don't see uh this being that different. But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you have kids? N- no. Not yet. In about six months we will. <SEP> Oh well good. Th- you'll have a little time think about that. I guess I I have uh. When I was teaching school I saw many so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose. And I can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it. Uh-huh. I know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have. But that's uh tha- that would be a part of selling it to the community. Uh-huh. <SEP> The adults uh ahead of it would probably never serve and and to each succeeding generation. There definitely would have to be a major P R campaign in each community each county uh parish or however the state was divided up. Uh-huh. Um I may. Well I don't know. Around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for. Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee-. And I I've seen it in other states too. Yeah. They have that here. Um. <SEP> I don't know. Um. They've got um in most of the states around here I think uh. You know down in North Carolina there was a big controversy for a while because they uh the local chapter of the K K K wanted to uh uh to participate in it. <SEP> And uh there was a. <SEP> And there were those that said No. You can't do that I'm sure. Yeah. Well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know. Yeah. Should these people be allowed to or not? I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed. <SEP> Oh. And I hadn't even thought about that uh the the other end of that. That that's an interesting uh situation. I hadn't thought of that. We had visited relatives in Virginia not too long ago. And I thought I had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up. And. Yeah. I think Virginia's got it. And I know Maryland does. And we just we went to Indianapolis last weekend and back. And um I'm pretty sure I saw yeah stuff in Ohio and Indi- Indiana about it and Pennsylvania maybe Pennsylvania. I don't remember for sure now. And I don't know about your part of the country. But uh down here in the last oh year plus I it was las- beginning with last year's Earth Day There's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns. Uh-huh. <SEP> And e- I work for Texas Instruments. Uh-huh. And they they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said Well it's not feasible. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's not a good idea. And I see that as being I I see that as being a a a change uh for the positive. Kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing. Yeah. And but then they lost too much business. <SEP> It's just thing a part of everyone's consciousness. Uh-huh. Well the thing about that is though it's got a. I mean because it was I mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that. And you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue. And I I'm worried that it it might you know it'll it the same thing will happen. It's like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years. And then people like well you know. I'd ruther rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know. And even if it's not environmentally safe who cares you know. I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way. Uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life. And if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up. Yeah. <SEP> But it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money. Especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf and and so forth. Just just every little bit does. It makes me feel better. It it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth. Well yeah uh. Well uh wouldn't. It's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out. That's that's right because. Of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are in Texas. <SEP> Uh no. No. Because if we. What was it seventy-four when we had the the last last oil crisis? And uh we started getting smart. And and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth. Uh-huh. And as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swang the other way. Right. <SEP> And we need those reminders. Yeah. Uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say Oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology. Right. Well my dad's in the in the solar energy business. So uh You know we're acutely aware of a lot of this. <SEP> Ah !. But you know on the other hand he voted for George Bush. So um you know I I wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing. Well I thi- you know. Just about anybody you could name whether I voted for them or not uh makes um uh decisions that I just can't go along with. Uh-huh. <SEP> But that's why they're there and not me. I don't want the I don't want the stress. Yeah. Well the the thing with Bush.
