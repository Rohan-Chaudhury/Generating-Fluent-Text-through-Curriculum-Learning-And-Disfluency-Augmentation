Well what movies have you seen recently Valerie? Let's see. The last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE. Oh we haven't seen that one yet. <SEP> Well don't bother. Oh it wasn't that good. Well oh from a woman's point of view and it was very uh chauvinistic as far as women go. Uh it was it was entertaining. But yeah. I don't think the general audience would would go for it. The most recent one that uh my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER. <SEP> How was that? That was excellent. It was just a really a really funny movie. That is one I've been dying to see. At the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves. There were parts that were sad. I mean it just ran the gamut of emotion. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And. And but it was just enter- all around entertaining. How long did that movie run? Uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge. <SEP> But I mean time wise how long. Was it two hour. Oh. Or. Uh it's I think it's less than two hours. <SEP> Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. We we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever. That always seems to happen when you rent them you know. Yeah. But this one it was fairly long. I I'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes maybe. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And uh it. But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby. Was it oh good. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh who was the. Oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy. Oh great. So we really enjoyed that. <SEP> Oh well I'm looking forward to seeing that one. That was next on our list. So uh. Yeah. I think that uh I can highly recommend that movie this to see. Okay. Okay. Good deal. Yeah. <SEP> Good deal. Do you rent movies very often. Or. Uh we generally rent a couple a week. Uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday. Right. <SEP> Right. They get they get taken up at the store. That's exactly right. So. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. We will rent two or three movies on Thursday. And uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good. Yeah. Right. Right. Most of them are a coin flip. <SEP> Oh gosh. Yeah. Yeah. And we usually have oh we don't get out as much as we like. We have two children. So we occasionally get out to the movies. Yeah. But uh it's it's fun it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once. Yeah well. <SEP> Quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends. Uh-huh. And uh we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see. And Uh Uh generally try to stay in the at least P G range. <SEP> Uh-huh. What ages are they? Have you found trouble finding movies for them. Or. <SEP> Right. The uh the oldest is nine. The youngest is three. He doesn't really pay attention. Yeah. Yeah. The five year old doesn't have the attention span either. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But the the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V. Uh-oh uh-oh yeah. So. <SEP> They have been doing that. We've been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see. The last one they saw was HOME ALONE. And uh they enjoyed that. But uh I missed that one. My husband took the kids to see that one. So. Yeah. My wife took uh I think the kids to see that one. But we can generally find something at the store for them to watch. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well that's a good deal. The. Uh oh we saw this movie. PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented uh last weekend. Okay. Let me think if I have rented that one. <SEP> Harrison Ford. Harrison Ford and how does the story line go? It's uh he is a prosecuting attorney. And uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered. <SEP> Oh okay. We haven't seen that one. And he's trying to find it. But course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her. So it's And it's an extremely long movie. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It's it's over two hours long. <SEP> Oh gosh. Oh gosh. Which. Uh my wife enj- she likes the suspense movies. I enjoy them to a degree. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think that's the one I wanted to pick up the other day. And then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me. So I thought I better save that one for another day. Save that for another day. Yeah. Because I think he'd like that one. Yeah. <SEP> You enjoyed that one then. Yeah. I think you it's uh it's something I think you would enjoy. Yes. Uh-huh. Okay. Well that's a good one to put on the list. It it's like most suspense movies. What was. It was on T V recently uh FATAL ATTRACTION. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's one that once you've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again. Right. Okay. So you know all the story and who did what and when it happened. <SEP> Uh-huh. So once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly. Uh-huh. Okay. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. At least I don't think so. I don't think too many of them are anymore. It's it's a shame. But uh. I don't know. We've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times. <SEP> I know. It's just slapstick comedy. Oh no. Oh. Sit there and laugh. And my one grandson and I. My wife can't understand it. But we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which is another funny one. <SEP> Oh gosh. Yeah. We've heard about that one. But we haven't seen that one either. So well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies. Yeah. We like to laugh. <SEP> Oh God. I I have a theory. I like movies for entertainment. I don't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie. Right. <SEP> Right. Right. I agree. I agree. Life's depressing enough. <SEP> That's for sure. Well I've certainly enjoyed talking with you. Well you too Jim. Okay. Bye. <SEP> Thanks for punching in. And uh. Have a nice weekend. I hope you see a good movie soon. Okay. <SEP> Okay. Bye. Bye-bye.
