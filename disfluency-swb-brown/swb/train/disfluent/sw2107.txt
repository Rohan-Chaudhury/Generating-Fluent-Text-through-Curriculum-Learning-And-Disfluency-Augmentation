You said you have four cats? Yes. I have four cats. How old are they? <SEP> Well they range from let's see about a year and a half to nine years old. Oh gosh. Yes. I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years. I've had him probably five years. <SEP> Oh okay. You get so attached to them. Oh yes. I love my cats. I lost one one time uh. Oh. The first one I got. He jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment. <SEP> Oh no. And he'd never been outside like you know by himself outside. Uh-huh. And it started raining. And I was hysterical. I was I was. I mean you would have thought a child had died. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. I called everyone I knew. I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat. Yes. I understand. And they laughed at me. They thought that was so hysterical. <SEP> Oh no. I understand. We uh we've gone through the same things with ours. We've had you know they've been ill. I mean I take off work to take care of my cats you know. Oh yeah. My boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy. <SEP> And then we had a baby. And it's like all right who comes first the cat or the baby. The cat was here first. So. I know. It's hard. And and then when we go to sleep at night you know it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us. Oh how funny. <SEP> It's like all right whose corners is this one. That's sweet. I have the two. The other two cats I have are outdoor cats. Oh uh-huh. And they didn't used to be actually. But they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside. So I put them outside once I got a house. And they're doing great out there. They love it. But the other one the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. Other than that he gets scared to death. If you shut that door he goes into hiding. Oh no. I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. That's it. And Lord knows what happened to him. He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares. Right. Traumatized for life here. Probably. <SEP> Oh yeah. We've. All four of ours are house cats. Are they. We started out with two with two outdoor cats. But our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them. Oh no. <SEP> Oh well he lived through it. Oh I couldn't believe it. We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills. Oh my gosh. The the cat almost died. And but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat. Oh he loves life now. Oh I imagine. <SEP> And he's like oh thank you so much. I wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened. I know. We wondered about that. But uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too. Oh I can imagine. What did he shoot him with. <SEP> Uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun. And then he started chasing him with a bull whip. Oh my gosh. People are crazy. Oh yes. Absolutely nuts. But uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet. And it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery. And tod-. Oh Lord. <SEP> I mean he started off as a stray. And then we did all this for him. Oh man. But oh he's been a wonderful cat. I imagine. They usually are after something like that happens to them. It seems to mellow them or something. <SEP> Oh yes. But uh we wouldn't ha- we wouldn't have them. I mean I don't see us without pets without cats. No. There's just uh there's this they just fill this void. Oh yeah. I ke- I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't I can't take care of them as well because they're outside. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it worries me that one day one of them won't come back. Yes. And I feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things. But I can't give them up. <SEP> Oh no. I just I go hysterical when they don't come home. Right. And you worry about oh who's taking care of them. Oh oh yeah. And every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you go crazy thinking it might be yours. Right. Well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night. We we- I had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh well I fell in love with this uh it's a Chinchilla Persian and uh brought him home. Ugh !. And oh my husband just died. Really. <SEP> It was like we can't take it back. You've got we've got to keep it now. It's here now. We have to keep it. Yeah. My my first one that I got. I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. It took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes. So I found this one. And uh actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. And I thought well that's interesting. I'll call them. Right. And he was the only one left. And his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. And he was the last one she carried across you know. The whole big sad story. Oh. So of course I had to take him. I felt so sorry for him after that. <SEP> Right. Right. And he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers. Oh no. Yeah. He. I asked the vet why he did that. And he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed. So. <SEP> Yeah. But he is the lovingest cat. Everybody people who don't even like cats like him. Oh. He never meows. He he doesn't have any front claws. I had him declawed. <SEP> Oh uh-huh. But he doesn't bite anybody. He's just he's just kind of there real friendly and docile. Oh that's good. Oh we just uh just love them. They uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey. And they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest. And it's like oh your claws need trimming. Oh yeah. Yeah. We do we call that doing biscuits. <SEP> Oh yes. Yes. It looks like they're kneading bread. Oh it just drives us nuts. Oh I just love cats. I like dogs. They're okay. I had I had a dog when I lived at home. <SEP> Um yeah. But they're a lot more trouble than cats actually. They really are. The cats are so independent. And they have so much more personality than a dog. Oh yeah. They do. <SEP> And but oh they're so much fun to watch them play. Oh they are. I love it. It's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities. Yes. And they just act so funny. <SEP> Oh we've got. Well the two that were outside they're like brothers. I mean I've never seen two cats so close. Really. And uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it is hysterical I mean. And then the other two cats will follow in pursuit. It's like this train. A train of cats running around. I mean it sounds like a train. We have wooden floors. And so it just sort of echoes through the house. Oh how funny. I can imagine. Yeah. I wouldn't give anything for my cats. I love them to death. <SEP> Oh no. They're just they're they're just uh they're wonderful uh. What are your cats' names. Uh we have uh Bonzo Bear Poindexter and Felix. Oh how sweet. <SEP> And what do you have. I have Xanadu and Precious and Rascal. Oh. Precious and Rascal are brother and sister. And they don't look a thing a like. Nothing. Precious is a medium hair yellow cat. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And Rascal is a black and white short hair. Nothing. They don't look a thing a like. <SEP> Not a thing goodness gracious. And they came from the same litter and everything. We have uh uh tortoise which is a black and and orange. Oh. <SEP> And she's so ugly. So ugly she's cute. Right. Yes. Uh-huh. I mean you can't help but love her. She's she's the oldest one and but uh very possessive. Really. <SEP> I mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma. Oh. And uh I mean it comes bedtime. And she's right there. Is she the oldest one? <SEP> Yeah. She's the oldest. And she. Well in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also. Really. And so yeah. It's uh. Wouldn't have. I mean oh if something happens to her. Oh I know. It's like the end of the world. <SEP> It will be. I know that's how I am about Xanadu. Oh goodness. You get so attached to them. Oh definitely. <SEP> My mother has dogs. And I'm like no. Yeah. This is nothing like cats. You can walk a dog. And that's okay for weekend. But cats are good all the time. <SEP> Right. I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person no it wouldn't have worked. It wouldn't have. No. That would be a problem. Oh that's one of the requirements I asked him. I said now you do like cats right. We don't li-. Have you seen those uh. Do you ever read COSMO. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago. And it had this man sitting on a couch with his date. And there were cats hanging all over him. Hanging on his clothes you know. They had ripped him up. And the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom. He said of course I love cats. And they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards. It was so funny. <SEP> Oh yeah. Oh the whole time I was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats. Are you getting rid of your cats. You can't be pregnant and have cats. I'm like uh no no no. Watch me. Right. The child will learn to like cats. And deal with them. Definitely. <SEP> I'm sorry. We are not getting rid of the cats. Oh I wouldn't either. There'd be no way. The whole family was so disappointed. Oh really. Oh well. <SEP> Right. That's life. That's how life goes. Right uh. But yes. We just just love them to death. I know. I love mine too. Well it's been nice talking to you. <SEP> Well it was nice talking to you too. I enjoyed it. Me to. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
