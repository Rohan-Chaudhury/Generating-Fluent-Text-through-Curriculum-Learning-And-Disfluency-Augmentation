Okay. All right. Go ahead. <SEP> Well what kind of car would I want to buy. Yeah. I don't know. The question is I mean would I want to buy. Or would I would I probably actually buy. May be two different things. Oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something. <SEP> If I had all the money I wanted then that's whole different matter. No. In that case I'd I'd I don't know. I I my dream car for years was a was a Porsche Turbo. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh I don't know if I'd want one of those now. Oh really? <SEP> Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me. Yeah. But I maybe would buy a B M W. Uh or or even a Volvo. Uh-huh. <SEP> What do you have now? I've got a uh a Dodge Daytona. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's actually the first car we ever bought new. Oh really. Yeah. We just we well I have. My car is the first one we ever bought new too. Uh-huh. But we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Me too. So what car do you drive? What is it? Uh mine is a Honda Accord. <SEP> Uh-huh. We almost bought one of those. Do you like it? Yeah. I do. And and um it's funny because after I bought it I was doing a lot of business traveling. And I. Some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors. Uh-huh. And um I don't like them as well except it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics. And mine is a standard. <SEP> Yeah. And the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better. Uh-huh. It had a lot more pickup and everything. <SEP> Yeah. You get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh what what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars. Um. <SEP> Usually AVIS. To what AVIS? AVIS. <SEP> Really. Yeah. Huh. I guess. It's just because we're on. I think of it. I'm not sure those are AVIS or not. But we have corporate contracts you know with the various companies. <SEP> I see. Uh-huh. So it depends on your destination too. <SEP> Right. Kind of strange. You work for a big company then. Work for T I. Uh-huh which is how I heard about this. <SEP> T I I see. Uh-huh. Um. But yeah. I I uh I don't know. I would probably if I were to buy a car mys- you know with the constraints of real money I probably would would go with something like you know like a Honda Accord. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Maybe it would. One thing I I really liked about about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have uh this seven year warranty. Oh really. <SEP> Um and it really saved us some big money once. It did huh. Yeah. They had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time. Oh my gosh. <SEP> And the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars. And I had to pay twenty five for the. Oh that was great. Yeah. It was. That's unusual to hear. Usually you know something breaks. You look at the warranty. And it's excluded. <SEP> Well we we bought the extended the the extension and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know I don't know four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra. Oh I see. Okay. Oh you got your money's worth. <SEP> Yeah. We did. But you know we really debated at the beginning. And of course I'm glad I did it. Yeah. Yeah. That is good. <SEP> But um we still have we still have like you know coup- three years left on it. Yeah. Well I've been lucky. Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it. Oh no. But I was real lucky because it just hit the um the lens to the light. <SEP> Bumper? Oh. It didn't actually dent the car or anything. So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that. <SEP> Well that was good. And the store will pay for it anyway. Are you. So. No big deal. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um if you were if you were going to uh buy a new car would you buy another uh another Accord? Um I probably wouldn't just because I already have one. <SEP> Uh-huh. But you know if I had to make the choice again I yeah I I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um although we did just buy another car. Uh-huh. And that's a Legend. <SEP> Oh yeah. Those are nice. Um but it's it's a used one. Uh-huh. And um my husband has really wanted one for a long time. And the fact that you know this c- this car that I have has performed so well. And before that I also had an Accord. It was a real old one. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I bought that used. I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that. And it served me real well too. Uh-huh. So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars. <SEP> Right. And. Yeah. My sister drives one. She drives a uh I don't know is it Legend. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's a. I'm not certain. But she's liked it. Um. Yeah. But I I have I have never had. And we. In fact what I'm driving right now. We bought a we only had one car for a long time. And and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth four miles to work and back kind of thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> And so uh I bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know little car that I could care less about. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> How did it go for you? Oh well it's uh it's worked. Hasn't left you stranded. <SEP> I mean that's exactly what it is you know. It's just a it's a cheap little little car just to go you know run around town in. Yeah. I know. Yeah. <SEP> And uh. It's actually kind of fun to drive. I I. You know getting back in the Daytona now I almost don't like it. You know. Really. It's like too too mushy. And it you know it's an automatic. Huh. <SEP> And. Well that's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the Legend. It's too. The steering. It's windy. <SEP> You know you feel like you're in a boat or something you know. It's kind of. I can't drive that. The Legend it's just so huge. Oh. I I don't like it. And it's so uh.
