I say Arlington Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington Virginia. Oh my. Yeah. Well and Plano Texas rather than Plano Illinois. Oh do they have one? <SEP> Yes. They do. Oh I didn't know that. Well I learned something already. <SEP> Yeah. Well let's see. The three questions are what uh. How much time do you spend with your children? Very little. Because they're grown. Oh. <SEP> What? They're grown and gone. Oh yeah. Well mine is uh down at U T Austin at college. And the other one is in high school. <SEP> Huh. So you do spend less time then? Yeah. C-. <SEP> Because they don't want to know they almost don't want to know us. They want to be with their friends. How old are your kids? Are they married or what? Uh yes. I have uh two married two almo- and then two almost married. And the other two I'm not sure. Well Two s- two two uh uh for sure are single. <SEP> Oh boy you have a lot of kids. Yeah. We have between the spouse and myself we have six. Oh well that's kind of nice though. You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday huh? <SEP> Because I came with a split family. And she had. <SEP> Well no. There is so much of them are gone. And they're doing their own things. And and a lot of times they they've got you know uh when the holidays. Well that's true. They have to see their other parent I guess too. <SEP> Yeah. And sometimes they want to do their own thing. So sometimes it's just spouse and me. I know. <SEP> And and you know what? What? Sometimes that's okay. I know. <SEP> Because. That's what my mother said one time. You know right. Because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays. Right. <SEP> No. That's true. And if they force them to you know that's not good either. Yeah. <SEP> That becomes a drudgery. And Well let's see. Well do they all live in the area? N- got of the six we've got four around here. Uh-huh. Oh wow. <SEP> Uh you know well we're talking like north Texas. Uh-huh. And then one is in Vermont uh Montpe- Mont- Montpelier Montpelier Vermont. Golly. <SEP> And the other one is in Everett Washington. How did they end up so far away? Well that is that's the the my little pair. And my second marriage. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh and uh. Those are the youngest ones? Yeah. Well the s-. The the the the fourth and fifth child of the of the of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Boy that's those are a long way. And Well they wanted to go uh. How. <SEP> J R my my my last son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with Washington state. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And the the the third daughter fell in love with uh uh Vermont. Vermont. So. So they wanted to make their homes there. <SEP> Yeah. That's where they've gone to make their homes. My goodness. Are they are those two married? No. They uh just working up there or going to school or what? <SEP> Well uh let's see. Yeah. I guess you'd say J R is working going to s- trying to go to school. Uh-huh. I wish to God he would go back. Oh they do. Especially if they if they're meant to I think. <SEP> Yeah. Well I certainly hope so. I mean I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T. And I'm I'm going to U T A right now myself. So it's never too late. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well it's oh I agree it's never too late. Right. <SEP> And. Especially in some of these schools around here I think they have about twenty percent older students. Yeah. And when you're saying older we're talking fifty up. Oh yeah. I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I say that's great why not you know. Oh my. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yes. Why not because that's a a lot of times well it's. I believe that uh we in that category. And I'm not in that category quite yet. No. But we are seasoned minds. Oh yeah. You're really ready to learn finally. <SEP> Yes. Uh-huh. I mean I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen. Yeah. It was. It was a complete waste of money. <SEP> Yeah. Settle down. We know what we're wanting to to uh study. And uh we know our limitations. Right. Right. We. Right. And uh. <SEP> And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether. No. We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning. <SEP> At seven. Yeah. We're past yeah we're past that age. Yes. We're we're smarter now. We know what we can do. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Uh so let's see. So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here. Uh-huh. And so the second question forgot what the second question. What was it uh. H- what do the trends in families. And do we approve what other families do. <SEP> Well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing. That's right. <SEP> But I have seen lately yes I am seeing I'm seeing a change that whoops government can't do it. A change? I was going to say the same thing. <SEP> Schools are not able to. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And between a person's religion uh their their faith in their maker w- whether you know uh whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever uh. Right. Right. <SEP> And the family. Are going to have to solve some of the problem huh. Those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal. And of course Judeo-Christianity uh and of the Jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the uh uh mission by the Lord to do this very thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> So when another group of of uh people step in try to do it they're they're tromping on our territory so to speak. So. Oh. I firmly believe that uh.
