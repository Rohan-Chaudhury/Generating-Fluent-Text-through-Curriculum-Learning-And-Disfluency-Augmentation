What type of lawn and garden work do you do? Well I do it all. I see. Do you have a garden? <SEP> Uh yes. I I try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden. And. We do the same thing. It's I just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet. Yeah. I have two plots. One's ten by ten. And one's like fifteen by four. I see. <SEP> It's a long skinny one. And. Yeah. You do a lot more area than I do. I've. All the rest of my yard backyard is uh you know pool and decking. It's all the dirt I have left in my backyard. Oh I see. <SEP> Yeah. I see. Well I enj- I enjoy fiddling around. It's cheap entertainment. Right. Right. Yeah. It's nice to get out in the open air. It is. Uh-huh. <SEP> And especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever. That's right. Yeah. <SEP> But uh sometimes I I said I sometimes I wish I had more space you know. I enjoy. Excuse me go ahead. <SEP> Uh-huh. I grow a lot of things a lot of food. Uh-huh. <SEP> And sometimes I I want to plant something there's not enough room to plant. Some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh squash or something like that. Plant one of those. That's right. That's right. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Takes a lot of room. <SEP> And it takes up your whole space. It sure does. I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe. My goodness what a mistake that was. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. They they just run all over the place don't they. They do. Well it was very good. It just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area. <SEP> Right. Right. It's the first and only time I've done that. We don't do anything exotic. We just do oh tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips I mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that. The basics. <SEP> Right. Yeah. That's what we do too. My wife used to plant a few snow peas. I don't really care for snow peas. Well she just plants a few for herself. <SEP> Right. Peas. Yeah. I I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago. Did you really? <SEP> The first one they started them indoors this time. I read it. Oh I see. And so I. Okay. We don't start anything indoors. We just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground. <SEP> Yeah. I uh I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that. Probably so. Yeah. You can get a head start on it. <SEP> But uh sure is a heck of a lot of work. I guess it it might would. Because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I I don't think I'll do it again. Well it will make it will make them taste better I'm sure. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. I enjoy it. I come home from work. And and I usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and inspect it. Sure. You got to inspect it. Yeah. <SEP> And the kids want to swing. Sure. And I push them on swing. Sure. <SEP> And I wal- I mow my own lawn. Yeah. And I do I don't have a sprinkler system. I I don't enjoy watering. No. <SEP> Especially. I. This is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system. Oh how. And boy it is really nice. <SEP> Oh. It sure beats dragging hoses around. Yeah. You can have it come on just early in the morning. And and off by the you know by the time you're up and about. That's right. <SEP> That's right. It's really nice. Yeah. I I usually get it started for my wife. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I and she moves it around ever other day. I'll have to admit I don't I do my own yard. I I really don't enjoy doing that. I enjoy having a nice looking yard. Uh-huh. I just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months you know until I retired. <SEP> Uh-huh. And now I I've lost my excuse for that so I have to. For the last couple of years I've done it myself. <SEP> Yeah. Sometimes I wish I could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> But uh they want too much money. It is kind of expensive. It is. Yeah. Of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them they're expensive too. <SEP> Right. Right. But it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself. That's right. If I have a problem discipline you know I think. Now boy I really need to get out you know and apply something you know. And I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something. Right. And the weed come up. That's right. <SEP> And all of a sudden you've got to do something else. That's right. I'm I'm kind of bad about that. Yeah. I enjoyed having a lawn service. But now I have the time. And I really can't I really don- you know don't want to spend the money for it. <SEP> Well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and and do it and stuff when you only have to. Yeah. <SEP> That's right. I'm not limited to just mowing it on Saturday morning you know. <SEP> Right. I can do it on most any day of the week. <SEP> When the days start getting a little longer you know you can I can start doing it in the evening after work. Uh-huh. That's right. <SEP> When they when they switch to switch. Yeah. When we get an hour more. Yeah. <SEP> When they rollback an hour. That's coming up here pretty soon. Is it this weekend? I don't know. It's pretty soon. <SEP> I really don't know. It just seems like I here it on the news the day before. Yeah. And uh I I think it's coming up here soon. I believe it is too. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well. Are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden? Uh not a whole lot uh. I I don't use I I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it. But then again I don't want the bugs eating it upping either. Right. <SEP> Right. I I. It seems like they come in spurts. Uh-huh. One year I didn't put anything on. And I didn't have any problems. Uh-huh. <SEP> Next year I was planting some broccoli and and some of those they're called cabbage cabbage loppers or whatever. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. They were just covered with them. Yeah. <SEP> I mean I went up. I didn't go out there for about three days you know because I and I went out there one day and the plant was noth- nothing left but a stem. Uh-huh. That's right. <SEP> They devoured it that quickly. Absolutely. They really go through it. And they they have a you a good appetite. They really do. <SEP> Yeah. And they would you know. I I picked off like twenty of them. And. You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too. <SEP> Ye-. Yeah. Boy they'll strip. They got that uh what is that safer soap uh B T spray this year. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I've been watching them every day. And I've and I haven't seen any signs yet. So if I see any signs I'm going to spray them. Yeah. And uh. I did something a little bit different this year that I haven't done before. I've got. My garden is shaped that I can. It's kind like this uh box shape. So I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. And put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure. <SEP> Right. And you know various other things Raised it up. Well the good stuff. <SEP> Right. And I'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe I won't have oh I'll have less of a bug problem. Any- at least they they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing. Right. Yeah. My backyard is uh is sloping. So I built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I had sandy loam hauled in. I had a dump truck come and dump it. Uh-huh. <SEP> On my driveway I guess that's what they do. And then I had to wheel barrow it in. Yeah. Right. <SEP> But uh you know you can improve your own soil there. Uh-huh. But the Texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil. That's right. <SEP> You you have to work on. You really do. Right. <SEP> And you know if I I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow. You know what I mean. That's right. When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden. So I had I had a lot of loam out there to start with. I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with. Uh-huh. <SEP> Do you have do you have a rotor tiller? No. I don't. I did it by hand. Small enough. You have a. Just do it by hand? Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It wasn't too much of a job really. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Like I say it's just. Yeah. I'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. It would be handy. And it weighs twenty pounds or something like that. Yeah. <SEP> My neighbor across the street has one. He always uses it to dethatch his lawn. Uh-huh. I see him out there. Yeah. <SEP> And I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it. It might be handy. Yeah. Yeah. They're pretty neat little. I've never seen one. <SEP> I have a friend who has one. And and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle when you know to go up. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. <SEP> And it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van bring it home and check it back and just grab it you know if I just go to my garage and grab it. Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Yeah. That would be neat. Sure. <SEP> That would be nice. We've had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know. Uh-huh. I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind. <SEP> What have you got growing right now? Uh got. You know tomatoes that are starting to bloom. Uh-huh. And uh I've got carrots I mea- yes I've got a few carrots up. And I've got some radishes up. <SEP> Uh-huh. And as a matter of fact I've already done a second row of radishes. Uh-huh. Yeah. And uh the green onions are coming along. <SEP> Okay. Snow. What kind. Excuse me. <SEP> What kind of onions do you grow? Do you grow those those ten fifteen Y? Yes. I've. For the first time we planted them this year. Oh they they are the best. Yeah. We tried to find them last year. We screwed around and waited too long. And I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But we've got some this year. Uh those. Snow peas are up. And uh my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side. <SEP> I see. They're up and doing fine. Yeah. I uh. Those onions I think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got on- onions. And they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like October. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And uh we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just can't compare. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That's kind of a let down. <SEP> She made these onion rings that were so good. Oh I bet. And and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it's an ingredient. They were. <SEP> That's right. We use a lot. We sure do. <SEP> And and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better. Yeah. One nice thing with onions and and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have you know too many. Right. <SEP> Right. We froze a lot of peppers. We let some turn red. Yeah. Uh-huh. We did that too. And some we do green. And then my wife puts them on pizzas. And and chops them up in recipes and things like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sure. Makes uh makes a colorful salad too. <SEP> Oh yeah. Put them in salad. Yeah. Uh-huh. You're you're making me hungry here. <SEP> We planted some yellow peppers this year. We've tried it before. Oh. And nope. We haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year. <SEP> Yellow peppers huh. They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something. Yeah. Sounds like you have a real good garden. Yeah. We enjoy fooling around with it. <SEP> Just let me see what I got. I got the peas. And I've got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets. Beets. Yeah. We've got some beets. Uh-huh. Uh and I planted potatoes too. Uh-huh. I've never done potato. We used to do it at home when I was a kid had a huge garden. <SEP> Oh the potato. They were they're delicious. But they. You don't get seem to get that much for the space. Uh-huh. <SEP> They they do. It takes a yeah it does take some space. Some beet uh potatoes. Yeah. <SEP> And I've got some tomatoes still growing in in containers. Uh-huh. I see. <SEP> I got to wait for a place to to to free up. Uh-huh. Uh our our kids love pickles. And we all love pickles. So we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year. Uh-huh. That will be neat. Yeah. <SEP> We've got some good um um Hybrid Burpee uh uh pickler cucumbers. Uh-huh. And we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own. And So because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store? That will be neat. Yeah. <SEP> Absolutely. They're expensive. I know it. I said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know? I don't know unless it labor intensive or something. <SEP> I really don't know. I guess. <SEP> But we're going to try that and see how that works. That will be interesting. An experiment. Yeah. <SEP> I'd like to try you know just try something new every year that I haven't tried before. Sure. Yeah. <SEP> And. That's interesting. Well. Well I'll let you go it's.
