There we go. Right. Well actually I'm a I'm a Dodgers fan from way back. <SEP> Oh. Um. How way back I mean. Like um late fifties early sixties. <SEP> Okay. So Wally Moon moon shots and all that. What's that? Yeah. Coliseum Wally Moon and all that. Yeah. <SEP> Okay. Yeah. It's a um. I I'm living in just west of Baltimore and Frederick um which is also just west of Baltimore has a minor league team. And uh and Wally Moon is the manager of them. Is that right? Yeah. So he's still kicking around. That's interesting. Yeah. I I also lived eight years in Ohio before going to uh going away to college. And I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens. <SEP> Oh I saw them. Um um I was out there last Summer. And I saw a game at Ned Skelton. Is that the stadium? Uh I couldn't tell you for sure. It's been a long time. Oh okay. So um there used to be a uh race track. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It was. That was impression I got when I was there. So. Yeah. I think that's right. Okay. Yeah. So had a lot of fun. Actually I mean I like minor league baseball a lot. It's cheaper for one thing. Well that's true. I think I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here. Uh they've led the American league in batting fielding and pitching. But they've never been able to do more than one of those in any any given year. So. <SEP> Yes. I think they're in for a odd year this year. Actually um they um. I don't understand why Encovilla got released. I don't either. I mean the guy's twenty twenty-five home rums maybe thirty eighty some R B I-s. I mean he you know he can't field. And you know he strikes out a lot. But I mean he's done that for five years. Why get rid of him now? Really I mean he really has become a a very decent fielder. <SEP> Oh yes. Okay. He's not a the liability that he was that he used to be. Oh okay. Um. <SEP> Oh he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys I mean with Detroit bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot. Yeah. Of course get a guy like Cecil Fielder you know. If he strikes out a lot so what. Yeah. Well I mean with Detroit I mean they can get away with one guy like that. I mean if I if I were in Detroit I would start building the team around Fielder. Oh yeah. <SEP> But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know which they did. Right. Yep. <SEP> So. Well I think the key for for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back. I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter. It may be. <SEP> I I like them a lot. I think they're going to go all the way. Um and and I mean by saying I like them I like their chances. I I actually don't like the Dodgers. I'm a Giants fan from way back. Right. Right. Well picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt. <SEP> No. But Butler didn't hurt either. Uh and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt. And. Uh who's the last one. Bobby Ojeda. They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks. Oh okay. <SEP> Um he's a a pretty decent pitcher. He's. Yes he is. Okay. You know he. Yes. <SEP> And uh that guy the short stop is going to be good. Yeah. Um. Well it should be an interesting year. <SEP> Yeah. I'm looking. I've already been to one game. And I should have been to two. But. Are you an Orioles fan? Um the the team I live and die with actually is the Red Sox mostly die. But um I go to the Orioles since they're here. And I you know I do enjoy them. Yeah. <SEP> Um I've had an opening day on Monday. Yeah. You know I kind of wish that they had inter league play like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while. How far is Houston? Uh three hundred miles. <SEP> Oh okay. Keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes. Yeah. It is it's incredible. Yeah. I um. You know we're we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team I can usually go up to Philadelphia. There you go. <SEP> And um saw saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before. Boy you are a baseball fan aren't you. Okay. Uh yeah. Interesting. <SEP> Um I try to see whatever I can. I mean I've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years. Wow. Yeah. Hope I'm going to do it this year because um uh having a kid this fall. So it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games. All right. <SEP> So so do it while you can. Yeah. Seriously. Sure. Well it's been good talking with you. <SEP> Yeah. Good talking with you. And and you'll be happy I think in October when the Dodgers win. I wouldn't mind it. Yeah. I'll be I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right. Yeah. Well God bless. And good talking with you. <SEP> And good talking with you. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.
