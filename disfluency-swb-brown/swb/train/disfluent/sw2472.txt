Perhaps this connection. No. It still echoes. Okay um. Do you like to cook? I love it. <SEP> I do too. Uh. It it's kind of hard to find time sometimes. But. Do you work? <SEP> Yes. And have a family? Uh I don't have a family. But I I usually work about fifty hours a week. And by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal. Oh !. <SEP> I expect so. Uh well for a dinner party I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine. That's that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party mine is is a is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce. Oh. <SEP> So. Where did you get your recipe for it? Um I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have. Oh okay. Well mine actually came from the um Texas Instruments Cafeteria. Oh. <SEP> They they. They have a T I plant in Texas in Kingsport? Yeah. We have. It's in Johnson City. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> And um the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes you know like once a month. They'll put out a recipe of the month. Uh-huh. Great. And they they put this one out. And I tried it. And it was really good. What is uh is a marsala wine a sweeter wine? <SEP> Yeah. A little bit sweeter. Uh-huh. And it uh it's a it's a red wine. Okay. <SEP> And uh I'm trying to think what else. I I roll it in bread crumbs and uh Parmesan cheese. Uh-huh. And then I rub it with a little bit I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil and pour the wine sauce over it as like the last twenty minutes so that it gets just enough flavor. Huh. <SEP> Oh. Oh so it kind of browns. And then you put wine over it. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. That sounds real good. <SEP> And it's really easy too. So. Yeah. What do you use? What do you serve with it? <SEP> Huh? What do you serve with it? I like to serve um a wild rice with it. Uh-huh. That's what I do too. <SEP> This is really neat. And I. We're big broccoli fans. Uh-huh. That's what I've got. I've got steamed broccoli down on mine. <SEP> Well I just I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that. No. It's great. I've got a good dessert recipe. Oh what? Uh do you like angel food cake? <SEP> Yes. I just break it up in a glass bowl. Uh-huh. And then I mix up uh some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi- and some cool whip. <SEP> Wow. And I make a thickened blueberry sauce. And I layer it with uh angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping. What time should we be there? <SEP> That sounds wonderful. It is it's great. I love desserts. But since there's only two of us it's really. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I try to avoid making anything that too fancy that we'd like too much and eat too much. Right. I know I know what you mean. We don't eat desserts much any more. <SEP> But I I guess one that that I really like that I haven't made in awhile. And it's it's called a fruit pizza. Uh-huh. And you take a uh sugar cookie uh recipe and and spread it out on a pizza pan. Uh-huh. <SEP> So you make it like a pizza crust. And then you you bake that. And then you um take things like kiwi and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want. Uh-huh. And you mix that with um excuse me you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice. And I can't remember what else is in it. And you make kind of a glaze. Uh-huh. <SEP> And then you layer your fresh fruit on that. Oh and pour that over it? Yeah. That sounds great. <SEP> It is really good. And it it's real light. It would be pretty. And it. Depending on the fruit you use it's you know it's real colorful. Right. Yeah. <SEP> Especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries. Right. That would be pretty. So but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream. We've been fixing something lately that well. We've been cooking a lot of turkey breasts. Because it's low fat. <SEP> Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. It's just so much better for you. And I've been making a hot sandwich. I toast a piece of whole wheat bread and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat Swiss cheese. Uh-huh. And then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it and pop it in the microwave. <SEP> Oh !. That sounds great. It is delicious. <SEP> I wouldn't mind serving that to anybody. No. And that's some- that's something that just you know it doesn't take a long time to fix. No. <SEP> It's really good. And it's really good for you. Yeah. It's real quick. And we eat out a lot. And there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out. Right. <SEP> And I wish I had something a little bit different to just zap together. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well ma-. <SEP> Mix up a little uh mayonnaise with some dijon mustard and honey until it just. Uh-huh. I mix it until it just tastes good to me. <SEP> I was going to say do you just mix it to taste? Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. And it's real good. And it keeps in the refrigerator. <SEP> How long does it keep. Do you well. You wouldn't have to make. Oh it keeps a long time. Yeah. And you wouldn't have to mix that much together even. No. Uh-huh. It keeps a long time. <SEP> I'm sorry I keep coughing. I've had a bad cold. Oh. And I put a little um oh yogurt in it too. Plain? Plain yogurt? If I. Just plain yogurt. It gives it a little tang. <SEP> I'll bet that is really good. It makes a great sandwich. Man. I'm going to have to think of that. We're getting company tonight. Oh are you. <SEP> And I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian. Oh yeah. That's kind of hard. So we're going to. I think we'll try to do something a little bit. We might try to to um to grill some flounder or salmon steaks. They'll eat fish? <SEP> Yeah. She'll eat fish. And I usually. When they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce. Uh-huh. <SEP> And um definitely go with it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables to make up for the lack of meat. Right. Uh-huh. That sounds good. <SEP> Right. I had a recipe from that um INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK TWO that's a great salad in summertime. Do you do you garden or not? No. We don't. Our next door neighbors do. And some a lot of times they'll give us something. Okay. It's just sliced tomatoes. And I put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty. Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips just over it and some red onion slices and just a little bit of um basil and then a little Italian dressing over it. <SEP> Yeah. Oh !. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Okay. And everybody loves it. And it's so easy. And it's delicious. That's what I was just thinking. It doesn't sound like it it would be hard at all. Huh-uh. It isn't. <SEP> Where did you get. And you can put some cucumber slices on too. Where did you get this cook book? I got it at the Checkbook Store. <SEP> Really !. And it's got beaut- all these beautiful pictures in there that are inspiring. It's going to say uh edited by Charlotte Turgeon editor of. I'm not french LaRoute Gastro LaMink. <SEP> The creative cooking course. I'll might have to visit the State Book Store. I'm trying to see who it's published by Ottenheimer. I've never heard of it. <SEP> I haven't either. This edition is published by Bonanza Books. Okay. It's a big book. But it was not expensive. <SEP> Well the ones that I've been I've been wanting to get um. I guess you've seen the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN and the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK PASTA. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> I've been I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken. Uh-huh. We do too. And we do eat a lot of pasta. Yeah. <SEP> So we we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to be to do without red meat. That's right. I don't think it would. You know we don't have that much of it now. As long as we have plenty of vegetables and lots of chicken. Uh-huh. <SEP> I stir fried some the other night though. Some uh beef and broccoli strips. It was good. But it didn't have much beef in it. Yeah. I've got a I've got a Wok that we don't use near as often as we used to. Uh-huh. <SEP> We used to stir fry a lot especially um a lot of chicken and and a lot of rice dishes. Uh-huh. It just takes the time to cut everything up. Yeah. But usually if I'm if I'm if I take a day off or on the weekend especially I try to cook real real food. Cook. <SEP> Uh-huh. And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead. Right. <SEP> So that we can have those to enjoy. Uh-huh. So. One of my daughters sent me a COLORADO COOK BOOK put out by the Junior League of Denver. <SEP> Uh-huh. Have you ever seen any put out by Junior Leagues? Yes. Cause we have some some local ones. They are great. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we have a share alike column in the paper where people you know write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. And that's where I get a lot of my recipes. Yeah. They are good usually good aren't they? <SEP> Yes. And I got I got a real good one from a doctor's office one time. Oh is that right. What was that? It's uh it's a baked bean recipe. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you mix baked beans and Lima beans. And uh let's see I guess. You buy the canned baked canned baked beans? Yeah. Just mix the canned beans together and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and you just bake it. And it's just it's like a a spicier baked bean dish. Oh that sounds. <SEP> And you can add hamburger if you want to give it a little more body. Uh-huh. That sounds good. <SEP> So I I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it. Right. So I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse. Uh-huh. Jot them down huh? <SEP> But it's been.
