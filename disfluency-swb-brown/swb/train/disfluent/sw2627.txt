Okay. So do you do a lot of cooking in your family? Um I do some every now and then. I I work. And my wife's home during the day. So she usually ends up doing most of it. <SEP> Oh yeah. When I was single we used to always cook around the house. Yeah. Do do you like to cook. Huh yeah. I really like it. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Um there's a few dishes. Like I I grew up with the um you know having Polish and Ukrainian food. Oh really. And my wife she likes Italian and stuff. <SEP> Oh. So we we definitely have different tastes. So. Yeah. Yeah. But that's neat though because you get to have different stuff. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I'm not I'm a pretty bad cook. I'm pretty bad. My husband is really good. He put himself through college working in restaurants. Oh wow. And uh he's much better cook than I am. So when I was home I still cooked a lot. And I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff. And now I went back to work about a year and a half ago. So one of the things that he took over was the cooking. And the kids are thrilled. They're really happy that I don't cook anymore. Uh they're like uh preferring it now right. <SEP> Yeah. They say oh dad let dad cook mom. Let him do it. But um so so do you all do you have kids? You obviously have one. Yeah. Two. Uh-huh. Okay. You have two. Yeah. One is uh nine months. And the other is two and a half. <SEP> Two and half oh. Yeah. That's the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh becau-. I was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it. Or are you not at that stage yet? Yeah. It does. <SEP> Yeah. We try our hardest to get them to eat what we w- eat you know. Right. And my sister uh she's the master of the fast order grill you know. <SEP> Oh yeah. She can make uh she makes six different meals. But. Oh my gosh. Like to have one thing you know. One likes chicken nuggets the other one like hot dogs. <SEP> Oh my gosh. I couldn't. And then she makes noodles with uh with s- soy sauce or whatever. Yeah. So all things. <SEP> Boy I couldn't do that. I. But um yeah. Our favorite. Let me think. I was thinking of the one recipe that uh that we made. I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy. And that was um uh scallops uh scallop um. What's that. <SEP> Oh really. It has a French name. It basically means that it has a Swiss cheese cream sauce with it. And you pour it over rice. Oh yeah. What's what is that Saint Jack or something. Yeah uh. <SEP> Scallops Saint something. Or yeah. Yeah. I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore. Yeah. Yeah. But uh i- it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then uh standard cream sauce base and then uh the scallops. <SEP> Really. With scallops. An and it sounds sort of funny. But it tastes really good. No. No. I'm from New England. So we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here. <SEP> And uh that sounds delicious to me. Yeah. That sounds great. Yeah. But uh. <SEP> I think we're just thinking of having a uh dinner party. We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game. They had uh a murder mystery. Uh-huh. And you came dressed as one of the characters. And you had to solve the mystery during the dinner. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it was really fun. And so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves. But we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table. And that kind of interrupted the game. So so I was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good. Right. Yeah. And then you can make that ahead. And you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready. Uh-huh. <SEP> So that's uh. Yeah. That's another thing. I have a problem with my wife. Yeah. She uh she likes to um she doesn't like the beef dishes. She likes the chicken and fish. <SEP> Uh yeah. And like I said we always ate beef and uh pork you know a lot. Oh yeah. So. <SEP> I know. My husband did too. His parents are Austrian. And they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table. Oh yeah. Red meat plenty of good red meat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My dad could eat a a meal with out any vegetables at all. <SEP> Oh my gosh. And uh Susan's you know they had you know meatless meals you know. Yeah. Yeah. My dad wouldn't know what to do. <SEP> Oh gosh. So do you. Course she grew up Catholic. So you know they they sort of come with the. Oh they did the. There's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have. <SEP> That you do. Right. Right. That's just part of it. Uh-huh. Yeah. We didn't my family didn't. But when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that. But my husband always did it kind of grudgingly. He never. Uh-huh. <SEP> There was dishes that he really enjoyed eating. Uh-huh. Ther- there were several things that he liked. But it never was really something that he would have chosen. It's just that I cooked. So he had to put up with it. Right. <SEP> So but there was one thing that he couldn't stand. And that was soybeans. I tried it like once or twice. And he just could not eat it. So I never. I had. I was limited. I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans. But. Yeah. It's hard to get a protein content up then. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. I like I like them every now and then for a change. Ye- it's nice. <SEP> Yeah. Some of the stuff is good. But it just it was a tremendous amount of cooking. Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete. Uh-huh. And we had little kids at the time you know. When I was home with them and it it was just so much cooking. I couldn't I don't like to cook. <SEP> And I'm not really that great at it. So it just turned out to be too much of a too much too much cooking. So well I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there. No uh. He's all done. He's set. Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. I set him down. <SEP> Okay. Do you like to bake at all. Or do you do you get into that's that. Yeah. We used to do that um. My mom used to go crazy every Sunday until my dad like blew up you know. Yeah. Af- after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy she stopped doing it. <SEP> But um she used to have you know two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls you know every week. Really. No kidding. And um the sticky buns of course would last you know three or four days. And that would be it. <SEP> Yeah. Then be gone. I know. That's the thing about baking. I used to I I don't mind baking at all. And I I can do a pretty good pie. We have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother. And my mother taught me how to make it. Uh-huh. And um so I can make a pretty mean pie. But um I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening. We had the same kind of problem. If you make homemade bread. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean forge- it's supposed to save you money. But you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat. It tastes so good. Uh-huh. We always we had that bread that was uh um. You ever seen the the starter bread. I can't remember what it's called. They call it the um Amish bread here. But. Oh uh yeah. Uh it's made with. You just le- leave it out. <SEP> Yeah. You know and you let it spoil sort of. Yeah. Uh-huh. I've heard of that I've heard of it. But I've never done it. You know yeah. <SEP> That sounds pretty good. Yeah. It tasted pretty good really. Yeah. Oh yeah. But uh it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad. And then you add all these other ingredients to it. But. <SEP> Yeah. And then you sa- you make the bread. But you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something. Yeah. Right. Ye- you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else. And that's how they continue the thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know it sounds it always sounded. I don't know how safe that was. Yeah. I know it sounded strange to me too. I figure well you're baking it. So you know yeah. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. That's that's got to kill anything I guess. But. Okay. Well I'll talk to you later. All right. Well yeah. Thanks. Where are you calling from by the way Texas. <SEP> Plano. Where? Yeah. Plano in Texas. Plano. Okay. <SEP> Are you in Texas? No. Falls Church Virginia. No kidding. Gosh it sounds so close. Yeah. I know we've got a good connection. Must be a uh T I connection. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I thought for sure I thought for sure you were in Dallas or something. Yeah. I I talked to so many people from Texas. That's where practically everybody I talked to is from. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state you know. <SEP> Yes. They're doi- they're trying to get all different amount of people. Well gee my husband is from Richmond. And I went to U V A. That's where we went. Oh oh really. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I went to school at uh well I went to school at West Virginia University. <SEP> Oh you did. Yeah. But I grew up right here in Falls Church right outside D C. Yeah. Boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast. I'll tell you. <SEP> It's nice over there. Yeah. It's sort of funny. I have people that want to go to Dallas. Oh really. Yeah. One of my one of my friends here he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to Dallas. Saying how. <SEP> Oh yeah. No kidding. Well things are doing pretty good down here. We we were we tried to move over to Raleigh last year. And there just was there was so little such little going on in Raleigh you know. You couldn't get a job to save yourself over there. So we decided we'll try in a couple of years. But but business is. Yeah. Yeah. We were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash you know. Yeah.
