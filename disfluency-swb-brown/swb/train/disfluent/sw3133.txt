Okay. Um well I guess first of all I I could have asked that before. <SEP> Do you have children? No. No. Okay. Because I I didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt. Yeah. <SEP> Um what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two. I think it's a good idea. I think everybody should should uh put in their time so to speak for the for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves. Yeah. I think it's uh. Would every- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about. <SEP> I just um. I guess that's my that's something that my family has always believed strongly in. And uh I had opportunities in high school to work in some programs um. Did you? Oh !. <SEP> And and I agree with what you said that it's uh it benefits the person doing it so much I don't think they realize. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I uh I I think it gives you a better perspective on life. And uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world. And and it would certainly help the country too uh. Yeah. <SEP> Really. Yeah. I think that's probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know. Yeah. They just they were they did things for people you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now I'm not sure they really do. <SEP> Yes. Yeah. Well I think sometimes through groups and organizations um. My first when I first thought of it I thought it uh when they asked the question I thought well that sounds wonderful. And then I wondered if people were unwilling. But but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long. Um but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um they do still have opportunities. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. That's probably true. You know. <SEP> But I I think that's a small uh number could. But even even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to? No. Um not since um not as much as I remember growing up. And that was something uh I think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I think that's probably true. But. I think it's probably more true still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Where uh where abouts do you live? What part of the country? Well I live in Richardson right now. Which is just. <SEP> Oh okay. We're in Plano. So we're not far apart. Right. Yeah. Okay. One of the calls I'd gotten before was uh down to Austin. And and I know a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest. So I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area. Yeah. <SEP> Gosh. I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area. But you're right. Yeah. I grew up in a real small town in Florida. Oh. I mean a real small town. And uh I think it was just. Of course it was back in the in the fifties. And I think it was real prevalent back then. I I think people thought more of others than they do now. You know as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it. <SEP> Yeah. Well. And maybe uh maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back. Um if we've lost some of that. And it it seems in the last decade or two um that's true. Maybe that's a way. If if young people had to do it um maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. Um is helping others. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I do to. I do to. I'm not sure that that today's kids would go for it though. I think you would have to start younger. <SEP> Yeah. I I don't know how young you'd have to go. But I think by the time they're oh early teenagers anyway I think it's too late now. At least around here. Yeah. I think uh I think it does help um even preschoolers you know. They're um things even just starting around the home. You know. Right. <SEP> Little ones can do a little bit to help the family. Uh-huh. And and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern. There's always something no matter how young. And then that helps develop that attitude. Um I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more. You know I think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it. But I wish. That's something that I think that has been lost in families. And I think that's a good place to start again. Yeah. I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for for your own immediate family you're sure not going to do it for anybody else. <SEP> Yeah. And I do think um the schools. If you're trying to do something even with food drives. And uh sometimes what Richardson and Plano both. I mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is. Uh-huh. I mean that's uh. Gosh I'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas. And uh it's. That's probably true. That's probably true. <SEP> I know our church youth group uh starts with projects young. But they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year. Uh-huh. They've done this for fourteen years now. Oh that's great. <SEP> Um and it is it's uh. And they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close. Some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it really. Every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed. And it's changed their perspective. And and that's just the t- two weeks during during the summer. Uh-huh. So if two weeks uh could have that kind of effect I would think uh. Well that's that's great. <SEP> I'm glad that there are still some areas that that get the youth involved in that sort of thing. Well that's. Like I said I think it does. E- even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes. <SEP> Yes. Well. Well I guess um. Did you have anything else? No. No. I guess that's about all. <SEP> Okay. Okay. Well I enjoyed talking with you. Well good talking with you. <SEP> And I hope you have a good evening. You too. Thanks. Okay. <SEP> Bye. Bye. Bye.
