Well uh ho- how do you view this whole subject? Are you uh one who feels like you have have benefited from the change in in roles in women? Or or what do you think? <SEP> Oh yeah. I. Yeah. I think so. Uh-huh. Yeah. There's been a lot of changes. I think there's still a lot to be made though. Yes. Oh yes. I think so. <SEP> Uh-huh. Are you uh are you someone who works outside your home. Or have you. Yeah. Yeah. I work for T I. Oh yes. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well uh have there been significant changes uh do you think in the employment place ex- especially uh say at T I. Uh-huh. Have has anything in particular changed that you have noticed? During your time there. <SEP> Uh. Uh I guess there's more women in uh what would be classified as a man's job. Yeah. Uh-huh. What what kind of work do you do? <SEP> I am a drafter. Uh-huh. I am in a man's job. Right. <SEP> But we have got more women in it now. Yes. Yes. There's a lot of us in it. Yes uh. <SEP> So. Yes. In years past I know in fact even even the word drafter has changed. Uh. Because it used to be they were draftsman. <SEP> Uh-huh. We have some engineers that still on their uh. The drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman. Right. And I want to scratch it out and put drafter. But I thought well I am not going to do that. Maybe not huh. <SEP> Well uh I when I was in college. I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four. Uh-huh. And I was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. So I was in a lot of classes where uh there I was either the only girl or you know one of just a very few women in the class. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So that was a change. And uh even uh I did not uh use my math uh in my work. I I became a technical writer. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh even so there were very very few women in technical writing. Yeah. But that has changed a lot. <SEP> Oh yeah. In recent years it has just really really changed a lot. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And and I think that uh you know the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management. <SEP> But I think they have got a long way to go. Oh definitely. Definitely. There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of uh chairmen of the board chair- chair persons uh if you sa- if you will of the board are women in this country. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I thought that you know that's pretty si- a pretty significantly small number. <SEP> Yeah. So there are some some strides to be made there. Yeah. Yeah. But uh I do not know. I I think we have come a long way actually when I think about you know when things were like even when I you know just when I was in high school and how it is now for girls. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And uh uh I guess my I uh the one my one bad thing is that I am that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because I think she would have really she rea- would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed in her generation. <SEP> Yeah. Do you. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Exactly. So anyway. Do you have children? No. Huh-uh. I was going to say do you have daughters. That's always a good question. <SEP> Do you? Yes. In fact I have a daughter who is in a a who just graduated in civil engineering from college. Oh wonderful. So she is pretty much although there were some other women in her class she was you know uh one of the minorities uh females in the class. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So she definitely entering into uh a male profession. Oh yeah. But uh But you know for instance there are there is the organization women the Society of Women Engineers. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. So that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But uh I do not know. I you see it in uh also in uh like in church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers. In uh you know in protestant congregations. <SEP> Oh yeah. And uh it will be interesting to see if if Roman Catholicism ever uh recognizes women in in the role of priest. I do- I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or you know what you know about that. <SEP> No. Huh-uh. Uh-huh. I am not either. But uh that is one area where it that I can see might change but I really doubt will change. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Not for a long time anyway. No. Probably not. Huh-uh. <SEP> So uh uh how about what in particular would you think that uh women still other than the work place where women still are being uh oh you know found wanting you know or not re- as highly regarded as men would be. Uh. I was just trying to think. Oh I know something. Uh-huh. Maybe you could te-. What do you think that what do you think tell me what you think about this. <SEP> Uh-huh. The uh the uh the role of women in combat roles during the war? Oh oh. Because I know that there now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And the only uh branch in the armed fo- services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force. And uh I spoke because women were filing flying missions into you know for whatever reason into uh in the Persian Gulf war. Huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And so. But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job. It was real interesting. They were. I was listening to some of the comments on ra- television the other day uh about it. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh one of one of the men who was a. I do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was very high. Uh-huh. He said it's just a personal thing with me. I mean I can not be real you know I can not tell you why I feel this way. But I just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman. I thought well at least he was honest. But that does not sit very well with a lot of folks I am sure. <SEP> There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women. Yeah. Right. You know Neil well Neil as far as I am concerned and I could be wrong about this but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Uh because I would think I think you know mentally uh and emotionally I think women can handle a job and every bit as well. Oh I do too. So anyway it's still. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And you know if she wanted to go to combat I do not see that they should stop her. Sure. <SEP> I personally would not want to go. But. No. I would not either. No. I agree. But I am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of job. Oh yeah. Yeah. So Uh I guess that should be taken into consideration as well. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So well this is an interesting topic. Um I have you know I have. Having a daughter who has gone into this into engineering I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. She's a lot more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive than I think I was. <SEP> Good. So that's that's progress I guess. Yeah. Well I have enjoyed talking with you Lisa. And Uh have you talked with a lot of people in this project. <SEP> Well same here. Or. Well I am not a home at home a lot. Yeah. <SEP> I am at work right now. Oh yeah. I put my work number. But at home uh the recorder gets my calls. Oh yeah. <SEP> Usually I am not there. Right. But I probably talked to seven or eight people. Yeah. Well that's great. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's good. I personally have not made any calls yet myself. I just it never crosses my mind. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well. But I enjoy receiving them. Yeah. Well that's good. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's good. Because uh I I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls. And uh only because I going to make some money. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. See we our choir is doing this as a money ma- raising project. Uh-huh. We we got the connection through a T I uh church member. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh uh so we are doing it to raise money for uh a large project at church. Uh-huh. And uh so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful. Financially painful anyway. <SEP> Yeah. That's wonderful. <SEP> It's just real nice that way. So uh I thought well I will just get on the stick and do it. Yeah. That's great. Well I will say good-bye to you. <SEP> Okay. But I have enjoyed the conversation. Well thanks for calling. Thank you. <SEP> Uh-huh. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
