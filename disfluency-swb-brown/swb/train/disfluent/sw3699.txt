Okay. Uh do you live in a home? Yes. Uh-huh. <SEP> We we it's a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now. Oh did you? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> First house. We've lived in ours for about six years. We had it built actually. Uh-huh. And uh uh it's our first home too. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. So what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to to renting somebody else's? Um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in. <SEP> Uh-huh. And um that was quite an experience. I I much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you have is it a fairly large house? Um it's uh uh it's like twenty-four fifty square feet. <SEP> Oh that's pretty good size. Yeah. It's a two story. Uh-huh. Yeah. How about yours? <SEP> It's tiny. Is it small? It's not much bigger. Actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is. So. Oh really. <SEP> Yeah. It's uh it's only like eleven hundred square feet. Oh uh-huh. Do you do you have children? Just one. Just one. <SEP> Yeah. Oh. But it it uh all the rooms are small I mean. But it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted. And uh. Use an extra one for an office which is handy. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. I'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one I guess. Rather have lots of rooms and lot- lots of space. But uh that ends up costing me. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood? Well they're it's pretty typical I mean it's a very very middle class neighborhood. Uh lots of lots of young couples with you know usu- oh. I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> And uh lots of kids and stuff. And so it it fits well in the neighborhood. It's it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood. But on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Is is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood. Uh. Yeah. It it it it does it it seems about oh probably average. Um. <SEP> Or is it? Uh-huh. But our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people. And you know there's older people here and and um people that are our our age. We're in our thirties. <SEP> Uh-huh. And um there's a lot of kids a lot of kids. People across the street have eight. Uh-huh. Wow eight kids? Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh my gosh. Yeah. Their home just burned down matter of fact and um last summer. Ooh. And they're just rebuilding. And um their house is going to be really big. It's. <SEP> I'm sure with eight. Gosh. Yeah. They're building a lot bigger. He's uh um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon. Uh-huh. And um so since the house did burn they're they're going. It's quite different than it was before. And it's it's a lot bigger. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And um but ours is about. It's you know it's a nice home. It's definitely not one of the the smaller ones. And um it's not the biggest either. But. <SEP> Yeah. New ones I mean they they tend to to be real tiny but that uh especially in newer neighborhoods. My my brother just built a new house. He lives in Wichita Kansas. And the um the neighborhood actually fought him on it. Because he he was um the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood. Oh. Now that's because he was he's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff. Yeah. <SEP> And his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood. But but they were they were pretty touchy on it. Yeah. You. He was a little surprised. You know that's interesting. You say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here. <SEP> Uh-huh. And when we um put out house in um they wanted us to have. There was one. We have part siding on on the two story part and then on the back. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they there was one side where our chimney was. And just the chimney was going to be brick. And they wanted us to have more brick. So we ended up having to go halfway up. Uh-huh. Which it does look nicer. And you know we would have like to have had all brick. But of course at that point we couldn't afford it. And but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all. <SEP> Right. So it's kind of like they were. Kind of depends on when they get in you know. Yeah. Yeah. And I and so it was kind of like it's they. Ours is the last street that they built on. So the houses actually on our street are a little bit they're kind of gone a little bit nicer. <SEP> Oh they have. It's gotten. Yeah. Yeah. I mean just they you know. Yeah. Oh. It's like the second phase. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit. And so that's kind of why I guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any. Um. <SEP> Well see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in South Austin. Oh uh-huh. And uh and the what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one. And they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled uh codes and and and stuff. And then they come back in. And and then they sell.
