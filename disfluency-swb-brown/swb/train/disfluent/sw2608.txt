Okay. Do you want to go first? You can go first. Or I will. <SEP> Well you go ahead. Okay. Well I'm going to tell you what I'd have. Down in the south we have a lot of shrimp okay? <SEP> Oh. Yeah. And I have uh shrimp that is steamed in beer that I cook. <SEP> Oh yeah. Uh-huh. And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook garlic bread green salad tea. And we'd have a lemon pie for dessert. <SEP> Oh it sounds fantastic. Yes. And what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker. Oh yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. And um you place the shrimp in the in the rice steamer. And you put a bay leaf and put some uh red pepper over it. Uh-huh. Now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can. Or you can just get some you know regular red peppers. <SEP> Is it cayenne pepper you mean? Cayenne? Yes. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you put a little bit of that over it. Now if you use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them. Yes. And you put that in there. And then you pour two bottles of beer over it. <SEP> And how much shrimp would you use? Two pounds. Two pounds. Okay. That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells. <SEP> Oh yeah. Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up. Uh-huh. And you pour the beer over the top of it. And you cover it. <SEP> Uh-huh. And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil and the shrimp turn pink. Okay. <SEP> Uh-huh. Then you remove it. And you put it on a platter. And then you serve it with melted butter. And uh I usually put garlic powder in mine. Oh yeah. And they can just dip it. And they shell it as they eat it. <SEP> Sure. But uh then the mi- uh the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave. Uh-huh. And what you do is you just uh wash it. And you core it. And in a like a oh what do you call it? Like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> A glass dish. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But it's got to have one that has a cover on it. <SEP> Okay. Uh-huh. And you uh put about two tablespoons of uh water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt. Yeah. And then you just set your cauliflower in there. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then you cook it for seven minutes on high. And you rotate it one time. And it's are you cooking the whole head at one time? Uh-huh. <SEP> Y- Uh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off. Okay. <SEP> I see. And uh you just set it in there. And you microwave it on high for seven minutes. And you turn it one time. Uh-huh. And while that's cooking I take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder. And I mix it all together. And I shred up some just regular white cheese. <SEP> Uh-huh. And after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it. And then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that. And you cook it for another three minutes on high you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it. Uh-huh. And it's done. <SEP> Yeah. Oh that sounds fantastic. It is good. <SEP> But it it looks. I mean what you can do then see is like what I usually do is I'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle. And then I put the uh shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter. Um um. <SEP> Uh-huh. And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that. And you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff. And then I just fix little individual cups for them. And they have the garlic bread. Sure. And it makes it a real nice looking you know. <SEP> And it's not much work. Huh-uh. Huh-uh. But it looks like it you know. <SEP> That sounds. Yeah. Real-. You look like you went to a whole bunch. <SEP> I bet it tastes good too. Right. And uh usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know. Oh yeah. And I'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that. <SEP> Now how many could you serve? Okay. Uh it usually serves six. Yeah. O- okay. I figured about that. Yeah. <SEP> Oh that's good. See out here we have so many uh ethnic people. We have Italians. And we have Portuguese. And we have Russians and Polish. And it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain you know? Uh-huh. So it's hard uh. You you just have to pick something for the the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time. Yeah. <SEP> And uh they're big on finger food here too. You know chicken wings and uh ribs and that kind of stuff. Uh barbecue and uh cooking out in the yard it ya- you know when it's nice. Barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever had crawfish? <SEP> Uh no. But I have had shrimp. Oh. You ought to try some crawfish. They are good. But see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking. Oh of course. You know they want it from down here. <SEP> That's. Yeah. Because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know. And more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is. <SEP> Really? But. Is it like shrimp? Uh it's similar. Uh-huh. <SEP> It's similar. Yeah. It's not exactly. Ch-. I mean it's got a taste of its own you know. But it is it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it. <SEP> Oh it does? Does it look like a lobster? <SEP> Um it looks more like a crab. Oh it looks more like a crab. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh. But. Are they thin long or wide? No. <SEP> Um let me think of I can't even think of what you. I guess if it uh it looks like more like a cross between uh a crab and uh and a lobster. Uh-huh. Because it's small like that. And it's got the pinchers like a crab. But you know it's it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh yeah. <SEP> Yep. And we call them mud bugs. Oh. But I mean they're fantastic tasting. They are so good. Everybody. It's it's the season for them right now. <SEP> And and where did you say you were from? Louisiana. Louisiana. Oh well do you do cajun cooking? Oh yeah. <SEP> Oh I love uh blackened you know uh the the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff. Uh-huh. Oh ! We have a few places up here that do that. Yeah. <SEP> And if ever I see it on the menu I always get it. Yes. It is so good. You know. <SEP> Now how do they do the blackened? You buy it you buy it as a seasoning. But uh do you have to have a certain skillet or something? Huh-uh. <SEP> Huh-uh. No? I cook mine well do you have a uh like a black iron skillet? <SEP> I did have. I don't have it now. But I have mostly Teflon. Oh okay. Well I guess you could cook it in in that too. You now. But. But I don't know. You know I never have. I use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine. <SEP> Do- does it have to get extremely hot? Uh-huh. Yeah. But it really it's not it it it doesn't burn or anything like that. The blackening is really the seasoning. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean there is it's it's a blackening seasoning. Oh oh I see. <SEP> Yeah. You know I mean that is a seasoning. That's really it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it. <SEP> Oh I see. Because it's called uh what it's called is Blackening Magic. And it it comes in a bottle. And uh Well I'm trying to see. Oh. It's got a a picture of Dom De Luise on it. <SEP> Oh really? Uh-huh. Oh. Now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time? Right. <SEP> Is that what you're saying? Uh-huh. Oh uh-huh. Because I could have the uh chicken on the skewers with uh uh blackened seasoning. But. <SEP> Uh-huh. And oh that is so good. Delicious. Yeah. But you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it. I mean your pan. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It does have to be really hot you know when you put it in. But it's not like it's burned. And it what it what blackens it is the seasoning. <SEP> Oh. And it is so good. Oh !. It is. I I love it. Yeah. <SEP> I I in fact I was in Texas for a little while. Uh-huh. And I liked uh the barbecues and the Mexican food. Uh-huh. <SEP> I have a passion for all that type of different tastes. Because I have been brought up mostly Italian American food. Because my uh parents are Italian and Portuguese. So we cook a lot of pasta and uh gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing. Uh-huh. That's why I enjoy going to restaurants and have you know trying different things. Well have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana you know to visit? <SEP> I would love to. Yeah. You ought to come down. I. Um you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans you know if you want to really get some good food. <SEP> Really? I mean you don't have to go that far south. Uh-huh. But uh of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as I'm concerned. <SEP> Is that right? And fact is we're going to take a vacation this year. We're going to go to New Orleans again. Uh-huh. And uh we're only going down there for the food though. <SEP> Now wher- where do you go when you go there? Uh right on Basin Street and those places?
