Well I suppose we both have credit cards. Uh-huh. Yeah. They seem to be a part of life. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. How do you use them? Well I do use them. Uh-huh. Uh I have a few favorites that I use more than others. And uh I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable. I I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few. Uh-huh. And uh they all can build up. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I think they're handy. I just get uh. I don't carry a lot of cash with me. Uh-huh. And uh I hate writing checks when you go shopping. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. Well do you use credit cards? <SEP> Yeah. I use a few. I uh I watched my grandmother go into debt on them. Uh-huh. And so I've. And then I guess my mother. Grandmother. <SEP> Huh? Yeah. So my mother learned from that. And I guess she taught me to be very very careful with them. So basically uh I just keep them. I use them so that I build up a credit rating you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> But otherwise uh I generally. And my husband it turns out. I've just been married seven months. But he has the same habit. And we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something. That's good. But we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge. Oh that's That's wonderful. <SEP> So that way we keep out of debt. And we keep on top of what we're spending. Well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what your savings is bringing. <SEP> Yeah. It's really I guess ridiculous to let them keep building. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I feel. So. But I know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that. I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come. But sometimes I forget. And so you know s- a bill will come in. And I'll think oh no I didn't know it was going to be that high. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh- yeah. But so far I've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time. So. Well that's good. I'm looking right now I'm k- kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate. It seems that some of them have gotten higher. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I saw on T V they had a program on uh credit cards. And they're supposed to. I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country. And I didn't write it down at the time. Uh-huh. And then I went and looked and to see what my visa was. And I think it's eighteen percent or something. <SEP> Um. So think I want to find something that has a lower rate. Yeah. <SEP> Have you ever used Discover card? No. I haven't. Yeah. I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off. But you know. Is that the one from Sears? <SEP> Uh I think Sears originally put it out. Okay. But it's uh it's pretty well taken all over the U S now. I mean uh I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover. And there's no annual service fee which is good. Okay. <SEP> You know and then uh they also give you they say cash back uh like at the end of the year. For the amount that I charge I get two dollars back or something. Uh-huh. But if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back. Oh they give you money back for using your credit card. <SEP> Yeah. Basically. Oh. That's it. I didn't know that. <SEP> And I think the service charge is pretty low too. But I'm not sure. Um. Well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards. Uh-huh. I worked w- at Sears for over ten years. And uh it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So you know now they'll take the Discover. But I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh I never did apply for a Discover card. Yeah. I just figure with the Visa and American Express I probably have an. <SEP> Uh-huh. I can do enough damage with those two. Yeah. I think it's best to keep the number down that you have. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. So. I've got some that I you know I haven't even used at all uh past few years. I probably wouldn't be able to use them. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh I I do like my Dillard's. I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop. Uh-huh. And I do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores. <SEP> Uh-huh. But. Yeah. Well Do you have anything else to say? Well. <SEP> No. Not too much more about credit cards. Okay. I don't think I do either. So. Okay. Well. <SEP> Well it was good talking to you. Good talking to you Beth. Okay. Good luck. <SEP> Have a good evening. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.
