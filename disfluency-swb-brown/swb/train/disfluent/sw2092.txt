Well the thing is is that I um. Since I'm in school I don't like basically have a monthly budget because I'm living off my dad. But the thing is is that um I have to keep it under control because for example you know it's like the the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything everything is pretty rough. But he controls that part. But then whenever you know. It's like once the semester starts I'm the one who has to control how much spending there is. And the only thing that I I basically spend my money on is just food. And um so. What about tuition and rent? Who takes care of that? Well the thing is is that I live in a dorm. <SEP> Uh. So uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts. Yeah. And then the tuition is also the same thing. So the thing is is basically that I spend like maybe thirty-five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries. And that's about it. But the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars um you know three times a week. <SEP> No. You can't do that very often. So I mean it's. For for us you know it's like I I can spend I can spend that money. But it's not it's not what I want to spend it on you know. Are are you working anywhere while you are going to school? No. <SEP> Okay. Because um they don't allow me to work since uh I'm a foreign student. Oh okay. And so they the government doesn't allow me to work. <SEP> Yeah. So all the money comes from home. Uh-huh. So you got to make uh. So how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending? Well the thing is is that um I ba- I basically know how much I have right? <SEP> Right. And so the thing is is that I I can tell like uh. I I get all my money out of the teller. Yeah. And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call you know international. <SEP> Where do you call to? Argentina. Argentina? Yeah. <SEP> Wow. And so the bas-. One of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills. Yeah. Talk too long. Well that's. They they want me to call down there every so often. <SEP> Yeah. I mean I told my dad li- Dad listen if you want to save money I won't call so often you know. He goes we want to keep in touch. So I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you. Yeah. So you call him collect? No. Because it is more expensive that way. <SEP> What makes you think so? Any any um. Basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of. <SEP> Yeah. And um because it's considered a luxury in other countries. Oh okay. So you just call him direct. And then. Right. Since it's his money anyway you know. <SEP> Yeah. And he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him? No. Um I got money to pay that too. Okay. So it's basically you know. It's like it's not too much money. And it's not too little money. So I won't have to you know rush a letter to him or something. <SEP> Yeah. Because um he really wants me to concentrate on my studies. Yeah. What are you what are you studying? I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering. <SEP> And what do you think you'll do with that? With those degrees? Uh-huh. Well I can I can work up um here up to a year. <SEP> And? And hopefully get a job after that. You want to get into some kind of manufacturing. Or what's the specialty that you're looking for? Um computer communications and data transmissions. <SEP> Oh okay. So you want to find a uh data transmissions. You're looking for uh um long distance type stuff. Right. Yeah. You know anywhere from um local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that. And so well you have a family right? <SEP> Yeah. I have a wife and two children. And um. And does does your wife work? No. She doesn't work. She does uh. Well it's kind of hard to say now days um other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself. Oh okay. <SEP> And she gets paid for that. So she brings some money in. Yeah. She is trying to start he- her own business where she does that full time. Alterations and sewing. Stuff for the public. Okay. <SEP> Yeah. And uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town. And so and you have a monthly budget? <SEP> Well s- sort of. We're probably like most Am- American families I guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month. Right. And we know what bills have to be paid. And uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget. So. So you don't have any problem in um overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that. <SEP> Oh sure. We're like everybody else you know. We've got a several credit cards that sometimes um instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time. Yeah. Yeah. You know that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff. Well then uh see uh that's that's one of the points which I don't see. Like I I don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas. And I you know I don't wa- I don't like to give any at all. <SEP> Yeah. Because the thing is is that you know it's like if I want something I'll I'll ask somebody you know. Yeah. Like like uh for Chr- uh for Christmas my roommate goes what do you want. And I said I want a backpack. <SEP> Yeah. You kno- no. I told him yo- if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack. Yeah. That's something that you can use. Right. Because I I needed a backpack. So he gave me a backpack. And I I knew he needed an alarm clock. <SEP> Yeah. So I bought him an alarm clock. So the thing was that that. That's great. Utilitarian. <SEP> Right. But. Necessary things no frivolous gifts. Right. But um the thing is especially remember when I was down in Argentina it was to me it was ridiculous. Because you know you have to. Once a year you go out. And you spend all this money on all these people. And some you don't care about you know. It's like. <SEP> That's true. Why bother. Yeah. Yeah. And so but the thing is is that um. <SEP> Well especially being a college student yo- your. I don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know. Yeah. That effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time. At the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect. Yeah. <SEP> What about when you have breaks like um Christmas or between sessions? Well for example we had spring break now. And I went skiing. And I spent around like maybe two hundred dollars. I expect so. So uh but you know it's like um. <SEP> You've got to budget that though. You've got to save up in able to do that right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean. Because it's like you know say you know it's like we were saying let's go eat out before spring break. I go let's not go eat out before spring break. <SEP> Let's see how much money we have afterwards. Right. And if I felt like I spent way to much then um I won't go out you know. <SEP> Right. And so like my roommate went home. I went skiing in over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything. Huh. But um but it was you know it was I guess it was worth it. <SEP> Sure it is. Any time you can get away and and get away from from the daily grind. You know it was a nice place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Especially if you live on campus and you don't have a car you just go crazy. <SEP> Yeah. I know the feeling. So oh well let's see how long have we been talking here. Six minutes and a half. Okay. Is that okay? Yeah. <SEP> All right. All right. Well nice talking to you. Nice talking to you. Have a good time. All right. Bye-bye. <SEP> Bye.
