Well how did you like that topic? Uh I don't know. I've got mixed feelings about the topic. Do you? I don't. <SEP> No. Okay. No. I'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know. I agree with it. I think uh I think a company should be able to test at any any employee any time they see fit. Well. I just I just don't think there's a place in our environment you know in the work force for drugs or alcohol either. <SEP> Well I don't believe in drugs or alcohol. But if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the T CAT they were talking about drug testing us. Right. Uh-huh. <SEP> And we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine. Uh-huh. And we found it belittling. You did? <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. Well I can sort of understand that uh. But not being a teacher as you are you know I I was not quite as sympathetic as you know as I probably would have been if if Kay were a teacher or something. That's true. But uh. <SEP> But then you know at the same token I'm not against. Because I look at airline pilots bus drivers you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's right. That's right. <SEP> It's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol. Uh that's right. And I think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know. <SEP> And. But uh. You know in those areas I really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know house. Yeah. I think so too. <SEP> I I agree with it. Uh I know Kay's company you know. They started it couple of years ago. And so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know. And I thought Jeez to me it's quite simple. Uh you either need a job or you don't. The the job is what provides all of your needs. And uh if they say Hey you can't do this work I'd say Hey I agree I don't I won't do that. And I think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first. Yeah. I think it's just like anything else a new concept you know. As I said if I have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted. Yeah. It is. I can see where you would think. Yeah. That is belittling you know I'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that. <SEP> But at the same token in education we can't do drug random drug testing on kids. Yeah. That's true. You know I mean their rights are protected. You bet. Oh gosh they they would really raise a stink if that was to happen. <SEP> What. Well but why if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids when we see them and they're you know under the influence. <SEP> Right. Yes. I agree with that. I I I wouldn't be opposed to it at all. It's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it to- tooth and nail you know. That's true. But uh well Lynn I've enjoyed talking with you. I don't know how long we're supposed to carry on a conversation do you? <SEP> It's three minutes. And the clicker comes in when it's time to. Oh well we'd better keep talking because I've not heard it have we. Yeah. Have you heard it? <SEP> No. Anyway we both sort of agree on it don't we about random testing. Well do we agree or unless it's not me. <SEP> Well listen. You know here we go again I mean. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah you know. If you agree that uh. I believe that truck drivers and people that have. Even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk. Yeah. <SEP> And there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk. Is that right? Uh-huh. You just don't think of that happening with teachers. <SEP> And he. I really don't. When I think of drug testing I'm thinking of the you know outside of education. Uh well no. You know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else. Sure sure. <SEP> I know that. But uh you don't think of that first hand normally. And uh. <SEP> Yeah. Well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation. Isn't that isn't that mind boggling. <SEP> It was on the news tonight. Goodness. It it is it's mind bog- you know well you know. I agree with you. I know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same uh good qualities as anybody else. Yeah. <SEP> Then I think you know if if it came push came to shove I'd probably be drug tested you know. Yeah. Yeah. Because it does you know. You you think the benefit would be greater than the. <SEP> Yeah. Because you know as I say I'm sitting there fussing and fussing. And yet I know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as you know I presume out. Uh-huh. And that was in your children's high school. <SEP> Uh-huh. Isn't that amazing. And you know my children brought it to my attention. I never was there to see it. If it if it's if it was true there I'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know because they represent a pretty good. <SEP> And that's not giving a good example to students. No. Certainly not. Certainly not. They don't need that example. But.
