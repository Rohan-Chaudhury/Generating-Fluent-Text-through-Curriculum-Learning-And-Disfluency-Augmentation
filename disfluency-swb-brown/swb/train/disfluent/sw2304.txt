All right. All right. What are some of your favorite foods? Mine well. <SEP> I imagine in Argentina you've got some great foods. Yeah. Well we got um a lot of uh European dishes. Uh-huh. We got we got what some people call the best beef in the world. <SEP> Yes. So it's uh Bishu. Like every Sunday you go out. And you buy all these parts of the cow. And then you just cook them over a grill. That's. Like in our house it's already built in. There's this whole special place in the back. So you can make a barbecue. I've had I've had that meal in New York uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And it's marvelous. And then. <SEP> I have to find a place around here that has that. Well they have one in uh they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown. So. Okay. I'll keep that in mind yeah. Um. <SEP> You serve that yourself or the for a family? Excuse me? You ever serve that yourself when you have company? Oh no. Well see the problem is I'm only twenty-two. <SEP> Uh-huh. But like like when I'm down at home. Yeah. And like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know. And I'll cook it. <SEP> Oh. You know like you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on. And then you know you put all these different meats which take different times. Do you buy them um separately at you know an American grocery store now. Or do you have to. You don't you don't go buy it from a wholesaler. No. But what happens is in Argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand and you know the dairy and products and whatever. <SEP> Little butcher shops yeah. And so. Yeah. I've lived in Mexico. So I know. And so they got they got the meat place. <SEP> Yeah. And so you just go there. And you can't find chicken there. You got to go to another place to find the chicken. Yeah. You have to you have poultry place. What do you what other what dishes do you serve with it? Well basically it's what we call it impenadas which is which is like. <SEP> Yeah. The turnover. The stuffed turnover. Right. Meat turnovers. <SEP> Oh I love those. Uh-huh. And then we also put sausages on a bun. And then that's that's to start out with. Yeah. And then what you have is also like you know like three different kinds of salad. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh that's about it. Do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker? Uh no. <SEP> It used to be in Georgetown years ago. He moved. I guess he he retired and went back to Argentina. I guess in nine- the early seventies. Oh okay. Yeah. So that mus- that's before your time. Yeah. <SEP> Your parents might remember if they were here then. No. We were only there for two years. Okay. I mean he was wonderful. We used to get the most marvelous impenadas and other Argentine things. Yeah. <SEP> And uh what I what I also eat now since I graduate. I have an Italian roommate. And. Yeah. I'm Italian. Are you? <SEP> Uh-huh. And since being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta. Yeah well. And you know. <SEP> Because there're many Italians in Argentina. Yeah. And my mom you know like makes like what we call niokes and all this stuff that it's just you know everything like lasagna and everything. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. My grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina. Oh okay. <SEP> This was around the turn of the century. Actually actually a little bit later like nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen. Yeah. Yeah. At one point one third of the population of Argentina was Italian. Like pure Italians. <SEP> Yeah. Well I'll tell you. It's interesting because when we cook here. I'm of Italian descent. My husband is Chinese. Okay. <SEP> So we and we both love Continental cooking French cooking. Okay. So we cook uh. Our meals are well. We don't we don't usually mix. I mean that sometimes. Right. <SEP> Well if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe. Right. Yeah. And um there are really easy recipe. That is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes. <SEP> And nowadays with microwaves. You can steam many of the things in a microwave. Yeah. I don't know if you have one. Yeah. <SEP> And if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done. Okay. Okay. <SEP> Okay. And it's a wonderful um flavorful piece of fish. Is it? <SEP> Yeah. Because I was at you know. It's like when you when you go buy fish you know. Uh-huh. Well like I buy like the fish. So you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish. <SEP> Uh-huh. And yeah. I've seen you know the filet. Yeah. Buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish mar- the fish counter. What kind of fish? <SEP> Um any white fish. Sole is good uh um flounder. Okay. Sole or flounder is real good. And even grouper. So we put soy sauce and sesame. <SEP> Little bit of soy sauce and sesa- sesame seed oil. Okay. And not too much soy sauce. Uh some chopped up scall- um you know slivers of scallions. And slivers of ginger. And then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes. Okay. <SEP> And if the fish flakes it's done. Don't overcook it though. Okay. Because I got I got um one of those little uh microwaves. The ones that take forever to boil a cup of water. Well you see just check it you know during. Yeah. <SEP> And another quick dish if you like um do you know what hoi sin sauce is. It's that sweet Chinese sauce? No. I don't. Well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N. Wait wait wait H. <SEP> H O I. H O I. S I N or S E N. S I N. <SEP> Either way they'll spell it. Hoi Sin sauce. It's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown. And if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork. And you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in. You can even put a spoon of ketchup in. Okay. Okay. <SEP> Okay. And that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice. Uh how much uh how much pork do you buy for two people. <SEP> Um well. For two people um Amer- if it's American style I buy a half a pound. If you know we if you're just serving that. But if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish um well with guys pretty healthy appetites I'd probably go a third of a pound. Right. <SEP> And then you know you could. Yeah. I could probably go half a pound. And you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know. So it's just it's just since I'm from Argentina I just love meat. <SEP> Yeah. And we. You can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef. Okay. <SEP> Just stir fry the ground beef. Drain off the oil. Use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables. Okay. Just stir that in. And you've got a very colorful side another dish. And how much does it cost? <SEP> Um the hoi sin sauce? Yeah. Oh a dollar twenty-nine a can. Oh okay. <SEP> A can would serve you for for you know for quite a few um meals you know. Yeah. Okay. I thought it was maybe like you know like five fifty or something. Oh no. No. No. No. No. It's not expensive at all. It's one of the Chinese cooking basics. Oh okay. <SEP> Yeah. Well listen it was good talking with you. Same here. Hope you enjoy your recipe. All right.
