Okay. Do you have any children? No. I don't. <SEP> You don't. Do you? Yes. I have uh one. A five year old daughter. <SEP> Uh-huh. Did you ever have her in child care? Yes. I do. She was um at a private well. I stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born. Uh-huh. And then I had her at a private sitter for I guess two two and a half years after that. <SEP> And how did you choose that sitter? Um she was referred to me by a couple of people. And she turned out to be wonderful. I couldn't have asked for anything better I don't think. Yeah. I didn't want to s- send her straight to a day care. <SEP> Right. And even though she was that old I still didn't want her to go to a day care. Yeah. And this lady you would think it was her own. <SEP> Really? Yeah. She's real good. It's hard to find people like that. Yes. It is. And um now I have got her in a Montessori school. <SEP> Uh-huh. And she's really really doing good and learning a lot. And actually I've started working up there in the afternoons too. So. Oh yeah. <SEP> Well that's neat. Y-. Well yeah. I guess. I'm going to quit as soon as school the school season's over. But uh I really enjoyed being with her up there. I hate it for her. She has to stay that much longer. Yeah. But. <SEP> Do they have classes for them during the summer too? Yeah. They they go f- uh year-round uh teach them. Huh. Now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips. <SEP> Yeah. There's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one and stuff like that. It's a lot more lax. But but they still go through all their uh curriculum as usual. What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there? Um gosh. I ca-. My husband and I both went. We kind of give her the third degree. <SEP> Uh good. I'm glad to hear that. Yeah. Well we went over to her house. So we told her you know pro-. Well we didn't tell her we just told here we'd be over that day. We didn't tell her when. So that way I didn't think y- you know the house would be y- you know cleaned or anything for me specifically. <SEP> Yeah. Right. And um she had a daughter. And I want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade. And um at the time she kept anoth- one other child um about a four year old I believe. But it was only like a part-time basis. So we went over there. And we questioned her about what she fed them and um what she did with them during the day and um you know just how she treated them how how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that. <SEP> Yeah. And uh we really seem to be pleased with her. And um. Did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision? Yes. <SEP> Oh yes. And she still loves her to death. I mean when they see each other you know they just love each other to death. And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter. Either making her clothes or buying her things. <SEP> Really? Yeah. <SEP> So we're real real lucky. But aft- uh. So she stayed with her about roughly two years. And she um she had to go back to work. They had some other expenses that came up. So she had to go I guess get a real job. Yeah. Get a real job full time. Yeah. So uh. <SEP> So what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school? Well I checked a lot of places out you know the Kinder Cares and the stuff like that. Uh-huh. Yeah. And uh I live in Garland. <SEP> And there's this Montessori school that's nearby. And um it had been recommended by some friends of ours. But uh it it's an older place. And so I uh checked out all the new places that were near us. And then I checked that place out. And uh even though it was older it was it was real comfortable and I guess kind of homey. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And they didn't just play all day long. You know. Like I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went and interviewed on or interviewed at um they did a lot of play work and stuff. And then they. Almost all of them had a Montessori section. Huh. And I thought well gosh that must be pretty good you know if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into into their school. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And they made sure they pointed it out you know. But after I looked at this place and I took Randi with me uh I think just about to every place. One place I think I didn't take her. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I just kind of let her go see see what she felt like doing. Yeah. And that place boy. If somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and it's hard to drag her away. <SEP> So I felt more comfortable at that place. That's the true test. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And she was real comfortable. And she has really really done good. I I. It's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her. <SEP> Yeah. But she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart. And she's already reading and writing and stuff like that. That's good. And she just turned five last month. <SEP> Huh that is good then. So. Yeah. I think so. I mean I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time. But. Exactly. <SEP> No. Especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years in school. Exact-. I wanted to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months because I know she's going to have to face that. <SEP> <SEP> Yeah. Really. And oh my God. Here we go you know. That's right. I just hate that. But anyway. So you don't have any children. Do you have any l- nieces or nephews then? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I have a nephew. He's a little brat. He goes to a really crummy day school. My sister's not real bright. So but he he's always sick. I mean he has always got some kind of cold or something. Oh really? Oh. <SEP> And I don't know. I don't think this place is a very good place for him. It's just kind of convenient. And she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else. Oh really. Just easy to get them there and stu-. <SEP> Yeah. Exactly. Well that's a shame. <SEP> Yeah. I don't think she checks things out very well. Which really surprises me. Oh really? That's scary. <SEP> It is scary. Yeah. Yeah. I w- I was petrified. I know. <SEP> I would be too. I mean that's uh. I don't know. That's just it. And that's why I don't mind paying more. Yeah. Um I don't know. I just feel m-. <SEP> Too many horror stories out there that you know. Yes. And that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is because I know what's really going on. <SEP> Oh yeah. That's right. I think that's an ideal situation. Because you don't know uh. Because like at her school um as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive. They sit. And they have car callers. And and some kid goes out and gets the kid. And it's time to go. <SEP> Yeah. Huh. Well at first that always kind of bothered me. I mean not bothered me. But I thought well you know I'd like to see what she's doing you know. <SEP> Yeah. But now that I'm there I mean it's it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle. You know when their parents come. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's hard to get them out. And a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that. That's right. And it's late at night. So you know now it doesn't bother me at all. But. <SEP> Is that where the. Over there off of like. I'm not sure what the street is. Is it off of near Country Club. Yeah. And all. Sixty-six. That one that's set back in the woods? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> I I I've seen the signs. That's it. But I've never actually seen the place itself you know. Yeah. <SEP> It's pretty set far back off the road. Right. Right. It w-. And that's something I like too. <SEP> Yeah. Because a lot of those places are like you know the one over here on seventy-eight Skaggs. Definitely. <SEP> Uh-huh. That little Kinder Care whatever it is? Yeah. You know it's right there on. Which this is on a highway too. But it's set back enough to. <SEP> Right. Yeah. There's a difference. I'm scared I would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out. Or or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could you know go in and get one. <SEP> Uh-huh. Ye-. <SEP> Yep. That's right. Or you know or a car accident. Yeah. And that was one of the places I had checked out. <SEP> Yeah. And it was it it was brand new when I checked it out. And of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there. Yeah. But you know I that. <SEP> I didn't base everything on that. <SEP> No. Because that all wears off. That's right. That's exactly right. You get some kids in there. And it's over quick. <SEP> Yep. But um I've been real pleased knock on wood. I'm scared to death her going to public school. <SEP> Really? I don't know. I w-. I do know why because you know d- drugs and everything else. I would be too. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And they talk about how soon they start that. <SEP> Yeah. And that scares me. I know. It is scary. I mean you're just with them. <SEP> Do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs? Yeah. They've um they've had police officers come in and talk to them about it. Good. But of course they still have no concept of what in the world drugs are you know. <SEP> Right. Right. But. <SEP> And what to do when they're faced with it. Right. But I just think of her you know. Next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with you know uh I guess ten year olds. Isn't that six sixth sixth grade you know. Yeah. And that's a big gap. <SEP> It is. And that's uh that I can honestly see the peer pressure there. Uh-huh. And that just terrifies me to death. And stuff. <SEP> Oh I can see it too. Those kids getting snatched. And I'm I'm probably a little too over protective. <SEP> Uh-huh. But Well nowadays you have to be. Nothing wrong with that. <SEP> Yes. You do. If. I don't I don't think there's anything wrong with that. So I at first thought you know when I didn't have kids. I was going God how can you be so protective? You know. <SEP> Uh-huh. But it's easy now. Uh-huh. Now you understand. Yeah. Definitely. <SEP> That's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own you'll understand. That's exactly right. And I do. <SEP> Uh-huh. But anyway. Well are you ever are you b- are you are you married? Yes. Are y'all planning on having kids? Or. <SEP> Yeah. We'd like to. Well that's good. Yeah. Because they're really neat. It's just.
