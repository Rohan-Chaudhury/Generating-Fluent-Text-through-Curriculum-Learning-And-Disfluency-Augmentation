Well what I believe is one of the major pro- uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough discipline. Uh-huh. And the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I agree with that. Uh when I went to school I know I was scared to death about being disciplined. <SEP> You were? And the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know you just you did not see I did not see anybody in my classrooms when I was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. From what I understand they act up pretty bad. Yeah. That's right. That's right. What uh grade is your daughter in? My my daughter's in the um fourth grade. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher can not teach. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. And when I went to school that just wasn't put up with. Oh no. Uh-huh. They always had a paddle in our school. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well they they just don't do that any more. I know. But the school system's afraid of getting sued and um all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. And I also believe we don't even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid. And we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And um I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems. <SEP> Yeah. Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for if we approve it? Yes. Supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for. And you know we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know I don't know your feelings toward that. I guess we shouldn't get into that. But um and what else um. <SEP> I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire. Uh-huh. I have heard stories uh from other parents that I know of their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs. <SEP> Uh-huh. No. Really? Oh yeah. <SEP> Ooh. I've I've heard some horrible horrible stories about high high school teachers. Uh-huh. And you know to be be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um. Um that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system. I think with what they have to work with I think they're doing a pretty good job right now. <SEP> Oh I do too. I think they're doing real good job. Uh-huh. So. But then what do I know. You don't have any children in school? Don't have any kids. <SEP> I don't have any kids. No. None at all. Yeah. Okay. So this is probably a real hard subject for you. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well I guess um we can discontinue our call now. Okay. It was a joy in talking with you. <SEP> Well it was good talking to you too. Okay. Thanks. We'll see you. Bye-bye. Bye.
