All right. Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there? Um we've got quite a few actually. What we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city. The uh. <SEP> Um we've actually had some warnings in uh Raleigh uh on air pollution. Oh you mean for like smog and stuff? <SEP> Uh-huh. Because of there so many cars. And we have a belt line alo- around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic. Huh. And um you know i- it's still it's just surrounding the city. And you can actually see it. There's a couple of uh tall buildings in Raleigh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And and you can actually you know. They're blurred. They're even dark. And what it is is the pollution. Huh. What do you think of that uh the greenhouse effect that's going on? Well I guess that's fluoro- the fluorocarbons. Yeah. <SEP> And uh. That's causing the hole in the ozone. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's very serious. I mean we can we're even feeling the effects of the weather from uh uh the shift in the jet stream. Uh-huh. It it is scary though isn't it? <SEP> Oh yeah. I mean uh the last two uh years our winters have been absolutely nothing. Right. I mean maybe one snow. Well all right. North Carolina. That's up there by Kentucky isn't it? <SEP> Kentucky? Uh-huh. Uh North Carolina is all the way on the east coast. Okay. <SEP> It's further west than Georgia. It's uh right below Virginia. Okay. Well Kentucky's next to Virginia I'm pretty sure. Well I'm from Kentucky. I should know. But I don't. I'm sorry. But Kentucky we use to have severe I mean just real cold cold winters. <SEP> Uh-huh. And we'd have three and four feet of snow. Course here in Texas they don't have snow. They don't know what snow is. They freak out when there's snow on the ground. Uh-huh. Originally I'm from Texas. So I mean Amarillo. So uh. Oh Amarillo? <SEP> Uh-huh. Well that's close to here. Yeah. Real close. How long have you been in Raleigh? <SEP> Um I've been out of Texas about ten years. Well how old are you? Oh twenty uh seven. I almost forgot my age. Okay. Well we're the same age. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. I forget my age all the time. So that's okay. It's I think it's just something that goes with the territory. Um. But to me Texas see and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school. Okay? <SEP> Uh-huh. In Texas I'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain I I swear they close everything down. I just laugh. I mean I do. They get I mean. And traffic slows down to nothing. <SEP> Actually they've been doing the same thing here. It's you know it's kind of funny. They um I guess northerners are different. But even uh North Carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather. Oh well no northe-. I'm from the north. That's why I said we in Kentucky we. I don't know. You just get used to the weather. And of course the people down in south they don- they're not used to cold weather and stuff. And uh it just. Uh-huh. I don't know. I just laugh. Every time they have a every time they have snow on the ground everything's closed up. <SEP> And you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road. That's true. But uh. <SEP> Do you all have much pollution there? No. Not really. I mean not to see it. Now of course there's you know T I is here Oscar Mayer. Uh-huh. And there is a few factories. But I don't see much pollution going on. <SEP> Well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road. Uh-huh. And you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe. Well see they have that um what is it a test or something like that they call it. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh that's supposed to cut down on it. Well. <SEP> Supposedly that's supposed to catch it. But I'll tell you what. And even these buses oh lord it real bad. These buses in Raleigh. Yeah. School buses and the commercial buses. Oh yeah. Yeah. <SEP> I mean school buses are notorious. Well they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is. Oh yeah. Yeah. And uh it it gets bad. <SEP> Well you know what they've started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top. Uh-huh. And that way it gets above um other cars on the road. Well that's a good idea. <SEP> And uh it really does make a difference although it it settles you know. Even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles. And and you know if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's that's even more miserable. I would I'd have to go out to the country to jog. Well uh the you know pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes. No. I didn't know that. When I was pregnant with my first little boy I had read it. Because back then because I was walking back and forth toc-. Well not back and forth. I was walking home from uh the college I was going to in Kentucky. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I was having to walk along the highway. It was just one day a week. But it was in. I I have no sense of smell. So I couldn't smell this. But it would make me sick. And I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway. Um. <SEP> Uh-huh. Golly that's that's bad. But. Yeah. It's. Yeah. All the exhaust. Uh. Well that was four years ago too. It's probably a lot worse now. <SEP> Oh I'm sure. Yeah. Well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people. And if you're older um I mean you can really deplete your oxygen. And it'll you know pass out. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's you know it's killed several people. Do you uh smoke? Um actually I'm a very I just smoke one in the evening if that. So I'm a very very light smoker. W- yeah. It's kind of l-. <SEP> It was kind of funny. They were doing some uh ozone testing and uh th- the E P A. And they were just screening some candidates. And I don't think I'd ever you know do that. But they uh asked me if I was a smoker. And I didn't fit into the smoker's category. And I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category. Um. It was you know I was just one of those. Yeah. Because you do smoke one a day. Yeah. In between people. So that kind of threw them off. Um. Uh. <SEP> But they're doing a lot of research here uh the E P A. For the air pollution. For ozone and oh yeah all that. They're they're real big into it. They've got Research Triangle Park here. And they're you know they're just doing a lot of uh lot of stuff. Huh. But they. I don't hear much about it down here. Course Texas we don't have a bunch of c- pollution. <SEP> Huh-uh. But too we've got that air coming in off the coast. Oh uh-huh. And you know it'd blow it up north. <SEP> Uh-huh. So maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here. Uh-huh. But no. It would seem like it would be the same way in on the California coastline wouldn't it? <SEP> Oh gosh I think I would hate to live in California the smog there. Uh-huh. I mean I can't believe they have warnings here which it it's mainly just when it gets real real hot. Uh-huh. But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially. <SEP> Really? W- well that's kind of good to know. Because I thought lord I thought I lived in a halfway decent area. I think they do that for most everybody. Um. I- especially it's usually for the young children and the older the old people older old people. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well you ought to come to North Carolina. It's a big change. It is? <SEP> Yeah. There was no trees where I was from in Amarillo. And here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know. It's they've got streams rivers ponds. Oh. <SEP> It's really pretty here. Oh well this is pretty wooded area down here. So. Is it? L- in a lot of parts. Yeah. I know Texas is supposed to be flat. But they've got you know down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Sherman and Denison. Do you know my grandparents live in Durant? They do? <SEP> Yeah. They live close then. Yeah. Real close. I go there. In Durant Oklahoma? <SEP> Yeah. You go where? Uh. You go to visit them? Oh uh-huh. Oh. <SEP> Yeah. We used to go fishing in Lake Texoma. Yeah. Well down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area. This. But but Kentucky's beautiful. They've got trees. And trees are supposed to you know purify. You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff? Huh- huh-uh. It's a philodendron. <SEP> Oh really? It's supposed to filter the air for you in your home. Well I'm going to have to get some. I had one. My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months four months ago. <SEP> Uh-huh. Do you smoke? Yeah. I do. Do you? Yeah. I do. <SEP> Did you smoke when you when you were pregnant? Yeah. I did. I couldn't make myself quit. Well. I did cut down a lot. <SEP> I mean I can understand that actually. I got I I've got one vice. And smoke is smoking is it. Well. I don't I don't drink. And I try not to cuss. And I do I do very little. And smoking I just I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen. <SEP> Yeah. Well one thing I miss is uh is the people from Texas are are you know. I miss their morals their values and everything. It's uh. Yeah. We're down here at the Bible belt aren't we? Uh I wasn't saved until I got down here. And people down here are just. There's so many Christians. And it's so different from Kentucky. But. Uh-huh. How'd you get involved in this research? Um I worked at T I for a while. But then my brother-in-law works there. And he got me into it. <SEP> Oh I see. Huh. How'd you get into it? Um I I was taking a voice I O class and um and actually doing some research. And so they told me about this project. Well it's fun. I like talking to new people. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I half the time well a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl. I've had to hang up and stuff. Uh-huh. But I enjoy it. I talked to people from well C- what Carolina now up in uh Boston and New York. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well Boston is New York isn't it? No. Uh no. Boston's above. Boston Massachusetts. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I've talked to people in New York. But I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. Because I guess it's because T I -s down here. Yeah. I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. I had one call f- actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and um. I can't remember where all. From up north like you said. I think one was from Boston. With Boston I love their accent. <SEP> I do. I love the Boston acc- accent. I met a girl from Boston one time. My husband was in the service. So we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas. Uh-huh. And his family's down here. <SEP> Uh-huh. We're out of the service now. Oh I bet you're glad. Yeah. He got out of it his unit right after Panama. We went to Pana- he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh gosh. And uh he.
