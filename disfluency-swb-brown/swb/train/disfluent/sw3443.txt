Surprised they get anybody this time of day. But I've been trying all different times. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I don't get anybody at five thirty don't get anybody at nine at night. So thought I'll try. Oh well I'm at work. <SEP> And I just happened to walk back into my office. Oh. I've been gone for a little while. Oh. Well I go to school. So I'm home certain days. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh I really haven't been making any s- phone calls have you? Got. I don't I haven't ever made any. I just receive them. Oh. Have you have you received many? <SEP> I haven't here lately. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's uh. Well the first time we were on this it came just about every day. <SEP> Yeah. I never had to make one. They just always came. Yeah. Exactly. People must be tired of it or something. <SEP> W- well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this uh subject. What do you think? Well I never gave it any thought myself. <SEP> I was hoping you could tell me what you thought. Oh. Well I don't have any objection to people doing that. I think it might be good for them. Uh-huh. But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent. <SEP> Exactly. I'm just concerned about their safety mor-. Uh-huh. Because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried you know. Yeah. Yeah. That that would be my main objection. Uh I don't think. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't know. I think maybe it's it should stay on a voluntary basis. It will probably never happen. But. Yeah. Yeah. I I think it would be good for uh everyone to do something like that. But I I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you. Yeah. Well it it probably won't. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway. We can't uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's another consideration. Exactly. But uh I don't know. Som- some kids are so spoiled nowadays. It might be a real eye opener you know. <SEP> Really. I mean sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here. And they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes. And then they think. They're just kind of shocked at that side of town you know. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl. <SEP> I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while. Oh. Well that would be an eye opener wouldn't it? Wouldn't it though? I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country. <SEP> Uh-huh. It is. I know. Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries I never even heard of. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I know it. It seems to me we are. It would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. But what do I know right? I'm just sitting at home and and uh doing laundry today and certainly not up. <SEP> Nobody has called me from Washington. Oh but uh anyway how did you get on this program? <SEP> I work at T I. Oh you do work at T I? Oh you're in Lewisville. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. I just went by that place. We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost. And uh we went by. <SEP> That's the first time I'd seen it. It looked really nice. Yeah. A lot of trees there. It looked like a pretty little a sight. <SEP> Hang on a minute. Sure. No. I don't think so. Yeah. Patty might. I'm back. Oh sure. Di-. <SEP> But how did you get on it? Well my husband works at T I over on Central. Oh. Uh why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure. But he works over there. <SEP> And tha-. We did it last time. Uh-huh. And uh so I'm just my daughter and I are registered this time. I don't know. They didn't even ask him back. <SEP> Really? That was weird wasn't it? Huh. But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't get too many. And I can never find anybody. Huh. So um. <SEP> The first time I used to get calls from far away too. Right. Like Maryland and New Jersey. Uh-huh. <SEP> And but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from. Yeah. I've had the same experiences. Uh-huh. All right around here. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. I don't know uh. I wonder if they really. I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents. There's just there's so many with this one town you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. E- even in some families some people talk a little bit different. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. My husband is from New Jersey. And one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me. And he doesn't pronounce them at all that way. And that's one family right? Of course I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny. But. <SEP> Oh I agree. You know how that goes. Oh shoot. Oh God. Well I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet. Sometimes she says at night. Or or switc- or overloads. <SEP> Yeah. So please end your conversation. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Well do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject? No. I sure don't. You don't have any kids you want to send over here? <SEP> No. No kids. Well is. Oh shoot. Well uh I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto. Well one of them is real idealistic. She might. <SEP> My sister is. I'd be more suited to that than her. She's just bugs.
