Well Steve did you go to college? Yeah. In fact I'm still going. Oh that's good. So you probably could give some great advice. <SEP> Uh well I don't know about that. But I in fact I'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school. Uh-huh. Well what's your ca- what's your interest. Your uh. <SEP> Uh well computer science and cognitive science. Uh-huh. So. That that's similar to what. I'm in a P H D program right now. <SEP> Oh I see. And uh my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical I think than uh than computer science. But my area of expertise is uh uh human computer interaction. Oh yeah. And I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study uh because it's of I'm working with voice systems. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. So so good luck. I guess we should talk about giving advice though. Wh- what what type of advice do you think you'd give to a a parent? To a parent? Yeah. <SEP> Well you know the thing is when you're a kid and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> An and I mean choosing from my experience you know I thought you know my I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want. Uh-huh. But uh I don't know. At the same time you have to decide what is important about the school. You know the size of it or. Yeah. I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change. <SEP> Yeah. I kn- I know very few people that uh started in one field and stayed with it. You know they. I think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh. I think that's much more important. I I think I'd I'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know. That uh some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer. But some of the uh the small some of the larger small schools you know I guess around three or four thousand students have a can offer a broader range of curriculums and things. Yeah. So if the kid does change they don't have to transfer. Or they don't have to uh uh. I don't know they don't have to give up years of you know of credit transfer and things. <SEP> Yeah. That's disruptive. Yeah. I normally. And and parents hate to hear this you know. Because I I actually teach college. I hate to uh I hate to talk to the parents. Because um one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want. And I always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation because you'll get better grades. <SEP> I I think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration. <SEP> Oh yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well yeah. I see what you're saying. Yeah. I always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in. Because that that's always I think more important you know overall. <SEP> Yeah. I don't know. Uh give me five minutes. Yeah. Oh you you're at the office now? <SEP> Yeah. At work? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just getting ready to go to lunch. Uh yeah. That's like what we were saying though. Would you uh advise a private school or a public school. I would I would it would. <SEP> You know what's the trade off there. What. I I tell you. I live in Maryland. And the public schools here are pretty good. I teach at a public school actually. And I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch- a lot of the private schools. And um I actually I would full time at a at a public school. And then right now I'm teaching part time at a private school at a Catholic institution. <SEP> Oh I see. And um and I really think I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school because I think their parents pay more. And I think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated. Where at the public school I don't think as many parents are public are are college educated. And I don't I think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious you know. They're not th-. It it's the minimal cost. But I think you can get a good education at public or private. But I think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know. I. Yeah. You have to really you have to look around at the school. I I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I think uh I would agree with that. In fact the thing that I'm going through the same thing where in graduate school I was trying to choose. Uh-huh. You know a particular institution might be better for my area. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yet like say you know the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Yet if I go to U of I or C M U or you know some you know any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better. But it's the same thing. There's you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing. Right. <SEP> Yeah. Does it have a big ten football team. Or. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's that's usually the basic criteria. Yeah. I mean uh yeah. Is it a PAC ten school you know. Yeah. But I think. Yeah. See I'm I'm at the University of Maryland so in this this region um though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland my diploma will still say University of Maryland. <SEP> Oh. Um you know it doesn't doesn't differentiate on my diploma though I would put it on my resume what program I went to. But I I think you know I'm actually at a smaller program. I'm not at the col- the big College Park campus you know. That's the big one with the football team. Yeah. So I I think um I think you're right that there's a lot of there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition. Um you know when I first was applying for graduate schools I applied to some big programs you know in this area like Stevens Institute of Technology which is recognized in the Northeast as as you know one step below M I T in a sense you know. <SEP> Yeah. So it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school. Yeah. And technical people know that. But I don-. Yeah. I think you're right. You really have to think about that for the job. I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor's. And when I. Now I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs. I was going to be a teacher. I was just a high school teacher. So most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of. <SEP> Yeah. You know but then when I went um for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know Shippensburg State where is that you know. Yeah. Yeah. And you know when I went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it you know. <SEP> Yeah. So I think yeah. That's important. Um. I think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job. You need that first job or so out of school too. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I I guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that job market. And uh um where was I at? Oh go- in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school. But there is also a whole other dimension I mean the growing up while you're going to school part. Uh-huh. Yeah. And uh actually in the Midwest especially a lot of the schools have like University of Missouri will have a main campus like Columbia which is big multi disciplinary. Right. <SEP> And they'll have a satellite campus in a usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field. So you've really uh I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Yeah. Depending on your technical areas. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that. But you know at some of the large schools I know that at at at University of Maryland where I am you know in a P H D program I I haven't even met uh someone outside of my area of information systems except for.
