Okay. Jay where do you live in Texas? I live in Dallas. In Dallas. <SEP> Uh right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state. And a uh it goes east and west and a north south tollway. What's that the I Thirty and Central express? It's. No. It's called Six Thirty-Five's the highway. <SEP> Okay. Yeah. It's the looper that goes around the city. Right. <SEP> And then uh the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway. Yeah. Just moved here about uh oh uh one about a month ago after twenty-one years two miles to the east. Oh is that right? <SEP> Oh how about that? So it's a very different house from the typical Dallas uh house. It's a new home? <SEP> It's about eight years old. About eight years. <SEP> It's uh it's a duplex type thing. Uh very modern and uh very open and airy light. Oh. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's different than the than the long Texas ramblers. Right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well we we live in a brick story and a half uh. <SEP> What's your house like? Cape Cod style I guess you'd call it. Oh great. Yeah. And uh have a big sun room on the back of it. <SEP> So it's got a lot of o- openness and light also? No. Oh it doesn't? It doesn't have. <SEP> Well that's what my wife really wanted. And so uh. With openness and light? Yeah. That's. I understand that. I would love that too. <SEP> Uh our our last house wasn't too bad. But it was just too traditional. Uh-huh. And so if uh. Yeah. This is very traditional. <SEP> The n- the next time uh probably a year and a half from now we're going to try to build. Oh uh-huh. So make one really uh contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light. Uh-huh. Do you have children at home? <SEP> No. I have three in college. Three? Oh boy. They they usually get back for the at least two of them for the summer. So But. You still need space plenty of space. <SEP> Still need a little bit of space. We we have a lot less than we had uh recently. Uh-huh. <SEP> Huh. Already cut back. Uh-huh. Well. <SEP> How big is your place? It's uh oh about twenty-five thousand twenty-five hundred square feet I guess. Oh that's good size. <SEP> It's four bedrooms and two baths and that. Yeah. We we had. It has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room and then the big room on the back. Uh. <SEP> Yeah. We had four bedrooms two and a half baths uh in the place we just left. Uh-huh. <SEP> So down now we're down to two and two. Two and two. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home. But it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're going to stay or whatever. Right. Uh-huh. <SEP> So. I was just reading an article uh that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas uh for sale by the Reso- Resolution Trust Com- Corporation? Oh yes. Repossessed. <SEP> Yes. And if you get in the if if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal. I I guess so. <SEP> Uh we we really didn't go that route and didn't look. Uh but uh the planning of them. And the the housing market probably still going to even go lower. There are many many houses ju- for sale just by the regular route. Uh-huh. So uh. That's discouraging if you own property. <SEP> Yeah. And we just decided uh uh sell. And we got we got a pretty good price uh for for what we had. Uh not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago. Few years. Uh-huh. <SEP> But that uh that was just the timing. Right. Well our daughter and son-in-law moved up back up here. He's from Texas but course she's from here uh about a year and a half ago and had their house on the market down there. Uh-huh. And they never did sell it. So they stayed six months. And she got her job back and he got a job down there. <SEP> Oh. Because. Yeah. They're not moving very well. Huh-uh. <SEP> For sure. Nope. And that's a good uh example of it. They live in Rowlett. <SEP> Oh yeah. I know where that is. I've been we've been here for twenty-five years. Have you? I'm from Missouri. And my wife's from Kansas. So I te- I teach at a college here. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's uh it's sort of home now. Uh-huh. So. What college are you teaching at? <SEP> I'm at uh one of the Brook- uh it's called Brookhaven College. It's one of the community colleges. Oh. And it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's very nice very convenient. The only one I know is Richardson. <SEP> Yeah. Now Richland College is out it serves Richardson and uh Garland. Garland. Uh-huh. And that's about nine miles to the east of here. Yeah. <SEP> So uh anyway well it's good to hear from you. Well I enjoyed talking to you. And I hope we hope we did them some good uh on their little computer dealy. <SEP> I hope so. Right. <SEP> And uh have a good life the rest of it. Okay. Thank you. Same to you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
