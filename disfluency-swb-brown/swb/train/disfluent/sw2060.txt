Okay. The topic is to discuss the uh sources where I receive news. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh for me that's mostly newspaper and radio. I almost never watch television as a matter of course. So I don't get news from television. Except during the war I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good. Uh-huh. Well why was C N N the only. Of course I think Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it. Is that not true? <SEP> Um. It was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage. Yeah. Um I don't know. I guess uh I don't even know why I watched C N N. I guess I just wanted more news. It's one of the few times I wanted more news than. Yeah. Well I know even if you watched A B C N B C or the other. I mean what's the other one uh C B S. <SEP> C B S. They all were were tapped into C N N. Were they? Uh-uh. <SEP> Yeah. That's the only thing they broadcast. And like you I listened to radio on my job at work. Uh-huh. And all this week they have been having this uh a discussion about that is why uh why C N N was. Well I listen to a Christian radio station. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world uh news service. And uh they. It was. You can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got you know. Huh. Uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I was watching on TV. They they broadcast this terrible riot. Supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem. So we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it. Right. And so it really made me question as to what how do we know you know uh if the news we're getting is any good. So. <SEP> Yeah. I guess the news just focuses on major events that probably don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made. Yeah. Right. Right. <SEP> But uh I I'm from California. And I can remember being in uh in these earthquakes. And I mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed you know from anyone else's point of view. Yeah. But they get all blown up in the news. Um. Uh-huh. Well I I find it depressing to watch our. Specially TV you know. It's just uh. Local news concentrates on murders and things like that. I'm from Dallas. And uh we have a lot of bad stuff uh. It just really gets me depressed even to watch it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. So then you wake up one morning. And you are in war with somebody. You don't even even know about it. <SEP> Right. So. Well what newspapers uh do you read in Dallas? Uh we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. But I don't I don't read newspapers. <SEP> Don't you? Huh-uh. How come? Uh-huh. I find it hard to uh follow from one page to another. It's just something I have never developed uh an interest in. <SEP> Huh. And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's stolen before I can get out and get it. Gosh that's that sounds pretty bad to me. I mean who would steal a newspaper? You would be surprised. <SEP> Huh? They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV you know t- uh selections of the day. I see. I don't know. It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it. <SEP> Yeah. So you're right. Who would steal a newspaper? But they do. Yeah. What part of California are you from? <SEP> Uh from Los Angeles. But I live in Raleigh North Carolina right now. That's where I am speaking to you from. Oh okay. But I grew up in L A. I work out here. Huh you work for T I? <SEP> No. I don't. I work for North Carolina State University. Huh. But uh I know some people at T I. And I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them. Yeah. <SEP> So I'm in the computer business. Well I. Boy current events is not a good subject for me. Well. I don't keep up with it that often. <SEP> Let's see I've I've I've never done this before. I mean I've never. This is your first call? This is my first call. Because I just got my password. <SEP> Oh really. Yeah. So I don't know. Are we suppose to. It seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes. But I think we've been talking for three minutes. And nobody has interrupted. Yeah. Well I I got into a conversation last night with a lady. And they interrupt at ten minutes. <SEP> I see. So if we've done our three minutes. Let's just let the conversation end and say bye. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well all right. Nice talking to you. Nice talking to you too. All right. Bye. Bye-bye.
