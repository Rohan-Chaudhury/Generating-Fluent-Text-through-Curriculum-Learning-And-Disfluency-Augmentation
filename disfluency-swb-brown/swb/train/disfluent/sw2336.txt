Okay. So what kind of car are you thinking about getting? Well none at the moment. Well when you decide to. <SEP> No. No. No. I currently drive a a Ford Taurus. Uh-huh. And I would ima- I would imagine that if I change or if I get another car a new car I will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard. So you like the Ford? <SEP> Absolutely. I have had it for about two years now. Uh-huh. And it's uh it's everything it's supposed to be. Uh I haven't had a minute's trouble with it. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus. But I still feel a little even after two years I still feel uncomfortable driving it because I had a Honda before that. Uh-huh. And so it's a little bit larger. Right. <SEP> But that's the only the only difference that I see really. But I would. My my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally. An-. Uh-huh. Yeah. It's the. This. The car I had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact. Uh-huh. And uh I loved it. I really did. But uh um I finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were. So I bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X. <SEP> Uh-huh. But even though I love the car I've got now I think my next car will probably be American again because if I can at all do it I'd like to stay American. Uh-huh. I always have up until now. I just for one time decided to go outside. So. <SEP> Well my wife drives a still has a a Honda Accord. Uh-huh. And it's a very it's an excellent automobile. And uh but you know price and so forth. Uh-huh. <SEP> I'm not a real car fan. So I I I do not uh opt for uh something that would be you know expensive you know. Right. I want I want something that's serviceable serviceable something that I can use. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh and I. And with the Taurus. I have a Taurus uh L X. And it's you know. You're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines. Uh-huh. And as I said as far I'm concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything I wanted. Well Ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to te- six years so of really turning around their um quality I think um. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh I think so too. Now I you know. In travel and renting automobiles uh in. Uh-huh. <SEP> I've driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so for- and Dodge. And I. If it's Chevrolet I just will not touch it. Um. Uh I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus. I purchased a a Chevy um Citation. Oh yeah. Those were not good cars. <SEP> And uh I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it. Uh-huh. And uh so I I shopped around. And I would I probably if I had thought I uh wanted to pay the amount of money I probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. And uh but it was just. I had I have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop. And he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon. And he just absolutely swore by it. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio and all these other things. Uh-huh. Uh it was just. There was no there was no comparison. Uh. The only thing that I find you know if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride. Right. <SEP> Uh not uh. That's about the only thing I find you know disadvantageous to it. But my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable. And I you know I drive around a lot. But uh and it's you know it's very comfortable on the highway. I can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way. Uh-huh. But those are my criteria. And I I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again. And if there's something out there that uh is comparable to what I have now I'll go ahead and get it. Uh-huh. You know the only thing I'm looking at right now um. <SEP> I just I just bought you know the Nissan that I've got about uh say nine months ago. I guess it was. So the only thing that that would get me to change cars right now would be if. See at the moment I'm single. And if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it. But uh I don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know. Uh-huh. Uh cars are too expensive right now to uh to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know. <SEP> I. Yeah. It's. In our parking lots uh two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh I I can't remember what the name is. It's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is. And it looked it resembled a Mazaratti very very closely. Um. And it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth. Uh-huh. <SEP> But to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just. I can't I can't conceive of doing that. Yeah. That's uh. I went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago. And um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff. But then you started looking at the uh uh. They had Ferrari there they had uh B M W and all these other kinds of cars. And Ferrari didn't even let you near the car. I mean they were. That's how expensive they were. Uh-huh. And then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars. You saw eighty thousand dollar cars. And even even though I I I do enjoy cars I enjoy um driving them I enjoy uh riding in them and everything but I can't see buying or paying more for a car than I would for a house you know. <SEP> That's true. Well. That doesn't seem likely. The difference there is too uh is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving. Uh-huh. <SEP> I never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen. Uh-huh. So I've never really cared. Now what I was you know. Before I was married and before I went to graduate school I used to do little sports car racing. I never it was never my own car. Uh-huh. <SEP> It was always someone else's. And that sort of thing I enjoy. But to go out and drive uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard. Uh-huh. So. Well I guess we've discussed that enough. Don't you think. I think so. <SEP> We won't we don't we won't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight. That's happened to me almost every time I've. That's happened to me once. So uh. <SEP> Well it's very easy when you get a top- you get on a topic that you know you enjoy. Yeah. Like uh I think the one time I did it was on Sau- the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there. Oh yeah. That was had a great conversation. But uh then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more. So. <SEP> Well I was talking to a lady last evening. And we were talking about fishing. And uh we were cut off well. We were told to quit. Yeah. Okay. Well you have a pleasant evening. You too. <SEP> Take care. Bye-bye. Good-bye.
