Okay. All set. Do you want to start? I can go ahead and start. <SEP> Sure go ahead. Uh in Dallas there's definitely a crime problem. I know it's you know worse in the larger cities. Um it's kind of a concern for me. In fact at the moment I'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment. And uh it's. I am single and female. You definitely are going to worry about the location and uh you know accessibility of people to be able to break in. I live on a third floor now. But I you know I'm real concerned that I I don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that. And the um. Do they have many buildings that have security there? Some buildings do. It depends on the location. The area I live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned. And we don't have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards. Some some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well I I went to Dallas uh when I worked for T I in Abilene. And uh I'm a little familiar with the city area Forest Lane and you know through that off off the freeway. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it didn't seem like it was that congested in that that part. You know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other. Uh-huh. And the cities are very populated with tenement housing where there are more than one family in a house. And with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um. And uh they- they're going to the big cities. It makes it very difficult. Uh-huh. <SEP> It really does. And and I've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before. Drugs of course uh a big part of it I think. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I don't know. A lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes. Oh yeah. Yeah. Tha- that that's really sad you know. You got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever. Uh-huh. There's a lot of that going on in Dallas too. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. It's really sad. It is. And and I don't know if it's uh the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I I really think that we're we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people. Oh I agree. I think that people are getting off too easy. They're getting they're getting paroled too easily. <SEP> Uh uh. They're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room. So they get they get lighter sentences. Yeah exactly. And some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose. <SEP> And uh you know they had uh. In fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter. He ran out to the store for a few minutes. And he had left her home alone. Sh- now ten years old. She's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know. Oh yeah. And while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store. That's what it was. And uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her and the whole bit. Oh my gosh. <SEP> And one of the men got uh I think it was seventeen years. And the other one was in for uh life imprisonment. Uh-huh. The one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven. And he's out. Uh that's terrible. <SEP> And the man said that you know if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself. And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I mean I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands. And that innocent people. Yeah. I I shouldn't say innocent because I mean ac- actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances. But. Uh-huh. <SEP> The reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things. Yeah. Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things. Yo-. I don't know. Right. It's a little more understandable under the circumstances I guess. <SEP> I I like the idea that uh if someone is from a foreign country and they come to this country and uh commit a crime I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Especially if they're found guilty of the crime. Uh-huh. You know once they they have been arrested. And if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's it. We don't take care of them. We don't support them nothing. Uh-huh. I mean they go right back where they came from. Right. We have enough enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is. So let let their country take care of it. <SEP> Exactly. And. We don't have I guess too much trouble in Dallas with. Well I guess I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico that cause problems. But uh. But that's uh the- they're so close. I I don't consider Mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like you take Asian countries or uh the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's like you know um they live back in whe- where we came from two hundred years ago. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know whe- we've advanced beyond that. And I think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing. You know what I mean. Uh-huh. It was amazing. I went to the Far East uh back in October to do some training for T I. And I. Uh-huh. Uh some of those countries were so safe it was unreal. Singapore is very supposed to be very safe. And in fact Tokyo. And I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people. <SEP> Yeah. But they. At at the T I there I said is there any area I should avoid. And the guy said let me ask another girl here. And he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself or anything. And she she thought for a few minutes. And she said no. And he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself. She said no. And they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway. Wow. And somebody will turn it in. And and nothing will be missing. They said they can just about guarantee that there that that would happen if you did that. I thought boy in America if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again. <SEP> Wow. You better believe it. If. You wouldn't even have to leave it. I mean. Yeah. That's true. <SEP> It would get snatched right off your arm. That's true. But I was thinking boy in Dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out. Oh sure. I mean I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place. They said the apparently the crime is just uh. <SEP> That's amazing. Well wh- what's the difference there. Do you know? I'm not sure what it is there. Now I know what it is in Singapore is they have the death penalty. And they really enforce it. Oh I I believe in the death penalty. I really do. Like for drugs for drugs they they enforce the death penalty for that. Uh they're just very very tough. And I guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too or Japan is too. They're just very tough on criminals. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I think that we're too easy. Uh-huh. Uh and we take the the uh civil liberties uh stuff too far. Uh-huh. <SEP> You know like people that are in prison I mean we didn't put them there. They put themselves in that situation. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. And as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean we educate them. We feed them. We take care of them. And they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again. Uh-huh. I'm not saying they're all bad. But I think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. I think that they should be put away. Right. And if they're overcrowded well you know they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place. <SEP> Get rid of them. Exactly. I I really I I think that that's the whole key here. This plea bargaining baloney where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior for every year they're in they get so many less you know that they don't serve the full penalty. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I I really think we're going to far overboard with all of this. Oh yeah. I agree because it's not fair to those of us that that deserve a safe you know life to have to. Yeah. Same with drunk drivers. Right. <SEP> I think it's too easy for them. Uh-huh. That if the the laws and and were were harsher and were enforced. Uh-huh. <SEP> I mean you have to set an example. You have to start somewhere. Uh-huh. And I think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again. Uh-huh. <SEP> An it an I feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people. This this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> And let's face it. What do they get paid. Right. Not much. Twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky. I wouldn't do it for that. Yeah. Huh-uh. And especially not in some of these big cities. Like in Dallas I mean they've had. They're up in the top top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed on on in the line of duty. And that's really sad. <SEP> It is it really is. And I mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything. Uh-huh. You know and I'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything. Uh-huh. <SEP> But they they're already uh have str- three strikes against them when they're out there. Uh-huh. Because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence. And you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say.
