Well I haven't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately. Yeah. So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated. <SEP> Well I can understand that. It's that time of the year. Yeah. We just my wife and I just recently moved into our house. So we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things. But. Um like to keep up to date too. Oh. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> I guess in the. Since I got out of college which was about five years ago my T V viewing started to tend more towards uh documentary news programs things like that. Uh-huh. Something that's going to keep mu up to date. I've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh. Oh yeah. I think when you're in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. That makes a big difference. So yeah. I I used to. When my kids were real little and I was home I watched. Where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis. But right now the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out. <SEP> Okay. Did you all ever watch that? I yeah I started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I I have a hard time sticking with something like like on T V because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two. Yeah. <SEP> You feel kind of left out. Right. Right. But um right. I know. But I tell you what um. We're really strict with our kids about television. And one night couple weeks ago it was just happened that we were exhausted. And they wanted to watch. And we said okay well we'll sit down. And we'll you know look at what you want to see. Let's just turn it on and see what's on. We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it. <SEP> I believe that. So you know it was prime time. It was what seven thirty eight o'clock on a week night. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And we have cable. And there wasn't anything on any channel. And the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know A B C N B C C B S was. It was just um dribble. <SEP> Yeah. You know I mean it wasn't even funny. That's right. It wasn't creative. It it was the worst I've seen. I mean I have not watched prime time week night T V I guess in a real long time because I was shocked. <SEP> Yeah. I know exactly how you feel. You know what I'm saying. <SEP> That's right. I uh when I first moved down here moved into the apartment and got cable and I guess I sort of kind of became numb. Uh-huh. Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V you know. <SEP> And then all of a sudden I started paying paying attention to network T V again once in a while. Right. Right now we don't have cable. Right. <SEP> And it's surprising how much it's changed. Uh-huh. The whole moral situation everything is just gone one whole complete direction different. And we don't have any kids yet. But I feel the same way. It's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids. Even even cartoons um. Right. <SEP> Oh. You know you watch some of the cartoons. And kids aren't aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there. Yeah. <SEP> It's. None of it's probably damaging lot of times. Right. It's just it's just uh like a necessary evil. I mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we just had Sesame Street. And that was about it you know. Right. Right. But now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. But it's just one of those things you know. You have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're if you're in the room. So But it's such a shame because it could be so good. That's right. I don't understand why first of all the public puts up with it. Second of all why the networks think that you know we enjoy that kind of stuff. <SEP> Well that's true. It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that. That can't be the problem. Uh-huh. It must be the marketing pressures. And you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody's I Q has dropped dramatically or something. <SEP> I'm glad you said it. And I didn't have to. But that that that's the. I feel the exact same way. I sit I sit and watch some shows. And I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show. I know. <SEP> You know why do you do this to yourself? Why do you do this? Yeah. I know. I'm trying to think if there's anything I do. You like uh I like stuff that's on Great Performances. And I we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that. <SEP> Okay. Stuff I guess that mostly public on public T V. Right. As a matter of fact you know when I was a kid excuse me my parents used to have. We had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched we had to watch an hour of public T V. <SEP> Now there's an idea. That was just the rule. And if they saw us watching the something. They'd say all right what did you see on WHAT'S NEW. Or there was some other. The children's program I think at the time was called WHAT'S NEW. Okay. Yeah. So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good. Do you do you watch sports on T V? Are you a sports fan? I can't handle it very long. Yeah. <SEP> I I mean I'm I'm a sports fan. But it's well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more. If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad. Right. Yeah. But uh it it's. You're missing an awful lot. Yeah. <SEP> I'd rather personally rather watch see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium. But uh But uh no I don't sit down. Yeah. That's true. The traffic. Uh. <SEP> I'll sit down for the big games the Super Bowl and the championship you know things like that. Yeah. But I don't follow any team. Uh-huh. <SEP> I check the scores the next morning. And I know how everybody's doing. And that suffices me. But I like I like good comedy good humor once in a while. Yeah. Yeah. I I enjoy that. But what do you where do you do you get that come-. <SEP> Well yeah. You don't have cable now. I was going to say they have a comedy channel now. But again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly uh commercials. And then you're you know trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up. You know what I did. There was a time there where I could tape things. And then I'd fast forward through the commercials. <SEP> Uh-huh. Saved a lot of time that way. Yeah. It works. You bet. Yeah. But that takes too much planning. <SEP> Yeah. No. I don't know. If there's any any series that I pay attention to I try to watch CHEERS once in a while. Now that yeah is that still real good. It used to be real good. But. Yeah. It is. Is it. <SEP> In fact it's I think it's on tonight. Oh. I just got in from outside. So I. Oh okay. <SEP> So I'm kind of out of it. Things like that. And I consider that fairly intelligent humor. You know. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> You can tell. They pick up the words every once in a while. Right. Right. Isn't it such a long running program. Yeah. Yeah. They do have a good they do have good writers for that. Oh that makes me think. Do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at all? <SEP> I try to. Yeah. We try to stay up too. Yeah. It's getting harder and harder. Ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up. <SEP> Yeah. You know it was it was just automatic too. No matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it. I think it's come around again. It's gone through cycles. Yeah. It was. We stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there. But we started watching again. Uh-huh. But it's real different show than it was when it started. <SEP> Yeah. It's funny now. And it's better. But it's real different than what it used to be. That's right. <SEP> That's right. But you can't be so can't be outrageous. Right. You know if you keep that same format. There's only so long that you can be outrageous. So. <SEP> Yeah. That's for sure that is for sure. Well I guess there are a few things around still. But. Yeah. But you have to hunt hard for them. Sounds like you pretty much agree. Yeah. I guess so. <SEP> Well. Well. Been uh good talking to you. Yeah. Good talking to you. <SEP> Okay. Take care. You too. Bye. Bye.
