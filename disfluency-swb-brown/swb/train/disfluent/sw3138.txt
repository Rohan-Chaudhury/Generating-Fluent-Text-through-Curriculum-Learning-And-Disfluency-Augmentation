Okay. I guess we're going to discuss food and cooking. Alright. Do you enjoy cooking? <SEP> Sometimes not all the time. I'm kind of that way too. When I have I I enjoy cooking when I have time. <SEP> Right. I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday. Yeah. That that's about the same boat I'm in too. It gets kind of boring. <SEP> Yeah. How big is the family you cook for? Uh five. Uh-huh. We have four. So and two of them are teenage boys. So. <SEP> Oh well I'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too. So. Are they? And they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. We have that problem too. Huh. But also now it's just the amount that they eat. <SEP> It's just absolutely incredible. Oh yeah. Well see I m- my oldest is nine. And he already he already does that. Yeah. <SEP> Does he? And I told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. Uh do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal? Favorite recipes that you've come across or. <SEP> Um. My husband and I our favorite meal is uh. And we do it. Like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak. Uh-huh. <SEP> And he does the steak. And then uh. Out on the grill? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And he marinates it in his special stuff that he does. Ooh. And it's real good. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I do sauteed mushrooms. How. So. Ooh yeah. <SEP> And asparagus. And that's our favorite dinner. Ooh that's sound good. I love that. My husband really likes seafood. <SEP> Yeah. So do we. Um and I think that no matter what I do I don't serve enough of it really to uh to suit him. I didn't grow up eating that much seafood. And uh so I don't know. It's just kind of not natural to me. But I like it. Yeah. And uh I don't know. One of his favorite things is uh. Well it's called seafood stew. And it's really it's really like a s- soup that that you serve over rice. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it. And. It's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it? No. No. That's kind of Louisiana I think if you do that. <SEP> I don't know what that. Yeah. I don't see how you eat that. But. I don't either. But uh. <SEP> No. This is just re- it is really good. And and one thing that's good is it makes the a large amount. And so I've usually we eat one. And I freeze two containers of it. Oh. Then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice. But neither of my kids will eat it. You know. <SEP> Yeah. So then they eat a pizza or. So it. <SEP> Yeah. It defeats the purpose. Yeah. It really does. One thing I've run across recently though. A friend gave me a recipe that I really like for chicken enchiladas. Oh yeah. Have you made them? <SEP> Yeah. My husband makes those. Does he ooh. I'm not I don't eat enchiladas. Uh-huh. <SEP> I I don't like enchila- I don't like the tex-. I don't know. I guess it's the texture or something. I don't like the taste of enchiladas. Yeah. But everyone else in my family does. Well are these are done with a flour tortilla. Is that what he uses? <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I it's I don't know what. I don't know. I I don't know what it is about the enchiladas. I just. And I'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother. I'm the only one that doesn't eat it. Isn't that something? <SEP> Yeah. But my kids love it. I was going to say my kids both eat it. I guess that's one thing that I particularly like um. But I think it's good for you know for for company too. And I've made it a few times. Um and you can make a lot at one time when I needed to make something to uh to give somebody. You know like you know to take over to somebody's house or something else. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I've got a chicken casserole that's like that that that I've. It it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family. And then. <SEP> Yeah. Because I when I make this chicken casserole I it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze. Uh-huh. So or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're not going to eat. What what does it have in it? <SEP> It's jus-. You can use chicken or turkey. Because my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sure. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it's rice and. When I do recipes I just throw stuff in. I don't I'm not real good about measuring. Yeah. Because I just. I do it to taste. Uh-huh. Sure. <SEP> And. Sometimes those are the best ones. Well yeah. But it it's like it's just chicken. It it's as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's it and some hard-boiled eggs. Yeah. Ooh that sounds good. And that's it. You just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through. Uh-huh. <SEP> And you sprinkle uh that those uh toasted onion rings. On top of it for the crunchy. Oh yeah. Those are good aren't they? Uh-huh. <SEP> And that's it you know. Um. And it it it goes. That sounds good. <SEP> And it's filling because of the rice. Right. So. You cook the rice before you put it in? <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good. <SEP> Yeah. It gives it a an extra yeah little tang. I guess I would now use the the new mayonnaise free. <SEP> Yeah. That cholesterol fat free? Yeah. That's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many new things like that because like I told my husband this summer I love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and you know basically it certainly a l- low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing. I know. You know and now it's it's it's okay. And you can even. I used to just put a tiny bit in. Well now I'm just putting more and more in. <SEP> I don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it. Yeah. And it's only it used to be like a hun- hundred calories per tablespoon. And now it's like twelve. Yeah. Oh !. <SEP> I know. I just think that's the best thing to have happened. I'm just so excited about that. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. We did the low-cal stuff. Well with my kids I don't. They get enough sugar and stuff anyway. <SEP> Mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway. Yes. And they don't need any added help. Right. <SEP> So when we're here at home you know with sweets and stuff they they don't we don't really do that much. I do a lot of fruits instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> And and drink wise they have Kool-Aid milk or water. Normally. Yeah. Now when they go to their grandmother's house which is every weekend. It's a it's a different a different story all around. <SEP> That's when they As our family would say a pig out. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's good. That's exactly what it is. Oh one of my boys that that's twelve um is has high cholesterol. <SEP> Oh really? Have you ever found out about your kids. No. <SEP> Not yet. Um and my other one does not. Huh. So oh year or so ago he found out. And he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down. And did !. He was able to get it down. It's I think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol. <SEP> Yeah. He's never eaten any eggs. He's never had anything but skim milk. And you know I've never bought butter and things like that. Huh. But um oh he just left for the doctor again. And it's it's kind of back up. Um so he needs to be careful again. <SEP> Yeah. So we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat. The lower cholesterol foods and stuff. And uh so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days. <SEP> And all that kind of stuff does really help. Well I think we've probably talked long enough. And.
