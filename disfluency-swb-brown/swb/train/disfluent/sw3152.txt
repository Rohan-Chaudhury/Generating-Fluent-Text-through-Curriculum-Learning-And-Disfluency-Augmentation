Well my favorite type of music is classical music. And uh I I enjoy orchestral classical music. And I enjoy classical guitar and classical piano you know. And that's those are that's my favorite type. Well. Uh probably the favorite instrument would be uh the violin. <SEP> Oh well my favorite well. I I don't really have a favorite. I I like everything basically. Um I guess if I had to pick it would be like pop I would think. But I like everything. So it's kind of hard to choose sometimes. Yeah you know. I guess I enjoy I enjoy jazz listening to jazz sometime although I don't feel like I have a good g- good understanding of it or a good a good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not. But but um I enjoy it. And uh sometimes I enjoy listening to uh fiddle music. Uh-huh. We were in Colorado recently. And heard this these uh well we heard this fiddler. And we bought his we bought his tape. And it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans. <SEP> Yeah. So. I grew up next door to uh the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader. So. Oh Chris Xeros. <SEP> Yeah. Oh you lucky thing. So we used to go and listen to them all the time. And my parents still do. Yeah. <SEP> So I grew up with a lot of his music and and what not. Plus my parents are well. Especially my dad likes a lot of classical music. And he introduced my brother and I both to a lot of it. So. Oh gosh. Chris Xeros. You grew up with his children too then? <SEP> Yeah. Oh gosh. Sure did. Gosh. Small world huh? <SEP> Yeah. We all went to high school together. And uh and we're still in contact with each other. Oh. We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends and what not. So. Oh gosh. Well actually I used to play in the Richardson Symphony. I played violin in the orchestra for several years you know. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. So. It is a small world isn't it? Yeah. Small world. So I uh I know Chris. <SEP> Yeah. He's a pretty nice guy. Most of the time. Yeah. Well I never I had to work for him. And I never would want to work for him. So. No. No. Well life just took different turns here. So uh it just didn't work out to do that now. So he's he's about ready to retire another year. And he. <SEP> Yeah. He sure is. He just became a grandfather. Yeah. I heard that. It's it's daughter it's his daughter that. Uh uh-huh. Yeah. They just had the baby's christening. So. Oh. <SEP> It was really nice so. Was it a boy or a girl? He's a little boy. Yeah. What did they name him? <SEP> I can't. It it's a. Oh gosh. It's like Elijah or something like that. Oh. I keep forgetting what what she named him. Oh. <SEP> His middle name is Chris or Christopher for for her daddy. Of course. But I think it's Elijah. Oh. <SEP> It starts with an E. Yeah. Yeah. I can't remember. Oh so you've heard the Richardson Symphony? <SEP> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We've heard them and liked liked it real well of course. Do you have a favorite instrument? <SEP> Um actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord. Yes. I really like those. In fact I had a harpsichord played at my wedding. Oh did you? <SEP> Yeah. Oh. Which was real nice. I got married uh during the Christmas season. And we played uh old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not. And it was real nice. I liked that a lot. Oh. <SEP> I liked the sound of the harpsichord. And it played by itself? No. Somebody played it. Well I mean but you didn't have oboe or something with it? <SEP> No. No. No. No. No. Just by itself. Just by itself. Yeah. Oh. It was real nice. Well that's really yeah that's I bet that was nice. <SEP> Yeah. It went well. It was a change you know from your traditional normal you know stuff and since it was Christmas time and and uh we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that. And so we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional Christmas carols. Oh. Not not you know the bouncy you know sing along kind but some of the old older ones that. Right. <SEP> Right. Some I don't even I recognize the the melodies and whatnot. But I didn't recognize the name. Right. <SEP> So it was real nice. Well actually I play I play the violin in in a string quartet that often plays at weddings. Um. So um I always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it makes it makes it nice. It makes you know you can say classy. Or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else. It does. <SEP> It really does. And it has such a different sound to it anyway. It's almost. I don't know the way it vibrates. It's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes. It it's. I I like it. Oh. I don't know how else to explain. But we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas. They're uh called Odessa. It's a husband and wife team that we've known for years. And uh we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff too. So we've had a lot of stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant. Plus my husband's real big into music too. So. He doesn't play anything. But he just likes to listen. Yeah. <SEP> And my dad and. My kids are now well. My oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast. And. Oh. Now does does the school in in your in your city. Does it does it offer like band or some of the instruments? Yeah. Well my my oldest is only nine. Okay. <SEP> So h- he hasn't really gotten into um that yet. They have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to. Right. But um he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet. Right. <SEP> So. Right. I think that starts in sixth grade. Probably. Oh. <SEP> So. Gosh. But I don't know. He he's he the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums. Cause his my brother plays. And um I don't I don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know. It's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something you know. Yeah. <SEP> Right. Right. You got a little ways to go too. Right. Yeah. Just a little bit. Hey oh. Well my well my oldest is eight. And and she's we've started her on piano. So uh. <SEP> Uh. But that's been it's been fun. I mean it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared. But it's been fun. It's been fun. I feel like I've learned a lot about the piano. I've learned a lot about playing the piano. Really? And uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when I hear it at other places or when I you know see some see and hear someone playing. I sort of watch their technique too and and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning. <SEP> Yeah. So it's been fun. I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it. Or.
