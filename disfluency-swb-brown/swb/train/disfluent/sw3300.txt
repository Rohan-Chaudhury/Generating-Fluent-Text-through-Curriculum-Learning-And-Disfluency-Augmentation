All right. So we started recording already? Uh I guess. I don't know. It's the first time I've made a phone call on it. Oh so you pressed one? <SEP> Right. Okay. So I guess we're supposed to start talking. Uh what kind of books do you read? I read uh a lot of Steven King Dean R Koontz uh some Danielle Steel. Uh-huh. <SEP> My aunt got me hooked on those. Uh-huh. So I. So it's mostly all novels? <SEP> Yeah. They're all novels. Okay. I'll read some uh classic too. Oh like what? <SEP> Uh like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck. I'll uh. Yeah. I like that. I like Steinbeck a lot. A A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner. That's one of my favorites. I have never read a lot of Faulkner. <SEP> Oh and this this is more of a play or something that that it was from that that I saw. And I read the book from that. Oh cool. And by the way my name's Bill. I'm from North Carolina. I'm Doug. I'm from Pennsylvania. <SEP> Uh I. Let's see. What kind of books do you like to read? Uh well a bunch of stuff I guess uh fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones. And like I don't really like the you know six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that. I really have to be in the mood. Right? <SEP> I I read one like maybe once a year. Uh-huh. I'm not as. No. Like I like say uh Richard Broudigan a lot. Uh. <SEP> I've never read anything by him. Okay. He's uh he's dead now. But he was really a pretty amazing writer. He wrote books that were like pretty short and pretty easy to read you know like written at a third grade level or whatever. Yeah. But they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny. Like He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA. <SEP> Okay. So that's anyway. And uh I read a lot of non fiction books too. Uh let's see. I like to read a lot of non fiction history when Civil War era and and that kind of thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I found that real interesting. I'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now. And that was on T V. Now what's that? <SEP> It was uh during Teddy Roosevelt's time. And uh about a American woman that got kidnapped in uh Morocco. Uh-huh. Yeah. <SEP> Uh this is when they were having their revolution or whatever. Uh-huh. And Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man you know. Yeah. <SEP> Surprised me. I had no idea that he was like that. Uh-huh. What how crazy? Well just like s- some one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle. <SEP> And it should be a grizzly bear because. Oh sh-. You you know like the t- t- grizzly and stuff like that. So it's. I saw the movie. And that's what made me want to read the book. Uh-huh. <SEP> Candice Bergen was in the movie. I'm a real big fan of hers. So. Yeah. Cool. See I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things. Uh-huh. I like I like to read some of the philosophy stuff. Like. <SEP> Uh-huh. Like let's see. And even like reading some new age things things that I don't quite believe in. Like here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE BODY. Yeah. I think that. It's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that. <SEP> I'm fascinated by that. Yeah. I'm fascinated by that. Uh-huh. Yep. <SEP> That. And and uh even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses. Uh-huh. I like. I'm kind of a doubting Thomas. And I like to read stuff like that. Some of it really freaks me out. Yeah. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Definitely. Uh. And I like to read uh I like to read some self help books like uh. I read DIANETICS once once I got past all the gibberish on it. Uh did you like it? <SEP> It was okay. It it it it took me a while to really get into it. It it didn't help me that much. Uh-huh. I see. But uh I think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways. Yeah. <SEP> Uh then I. One in- real interesting book I read recently was when I was looking for a job. I read HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED. And it it had real good tips. And it. And I got the job that I wanted by applying the the methods that that. Uh-huh.
