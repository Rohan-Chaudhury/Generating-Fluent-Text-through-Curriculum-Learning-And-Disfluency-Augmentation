All right. Well like I told you before. And you're talking about credit cards. Uh-huh. <SEP> We put ours up. I mean I had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up. Um I wish I had. Well you should try it. Well I. It was done for me after a while. I had a uh I had a business going. And this was back in the eighties. I don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that. But uh I had a coin shop. And everything was going great while gold and silver was up. And it started falling. <SEP> Yeah. So I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards. And things got worse and worse. And finally boom. You lost your business? Yep. <SEP> Oh gol. What a nightmare. Yeah. It was. I ended up going into bank- you know. It was one of those things uh. Oh it'll get better next week you know. Things will pick up. And so there I was in old bankruptcy court. Well you weren't charging gold and silver were you? You can't do that can you? Oh yeah. <SEP> Oh you can? Oh yeah. Yeah. I was buying from other dealers. And uh you know they take payment any way they can get it. Oh that's a nightmare. Yeah. Course on on stuff that I was on merchandise that I was buying on cards it was I was getting the money back. Because I was selling it. I wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it. Uh but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up. <SEP> Uh-huh. So. Well I remember before I got married. You know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Of course you fill them all out because you're honored. Sure. <SEP> And uh I had stuff for like Sanger Harris. And you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars. And I thought Well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month. Uh-huh. Right. Yeah. <SEP> I wasn't thinking a thing about it. That's the way they suck you in. Yeah. I was just stupid. And every time they had a sale there I was. Uh-huh. <SEP> Because you know got get such good bargains. Uh-huh. And I don't know. Well just today in the mail I got uh I got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express. <SEP> Oh yeah. We've been getting those. Yeah. I went back to school and got my Master's. And they started sending those things to me again. Yeah. As soon as you're a graduate student they get your name. <SEP> Yeah. They did. And uh course I guess I guess I've been purged from their records. I used to have an American Express. Uh back when I had my business I got one. Uh-huh. And they they goofed up bad on my fir- on my very first bill. Because I was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses. <SEP> Yeah. And the bill would come in. And I'd pay it. And the very first bill I paid it. And then I got this nasty letter from them saying You're overdue pay. So I said Well it just crossed in the mail. So I didn't do anything about it. Two weeks later I get another letter even nastier. And said We're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay. And I looked at that. And I said Uh-huh. So by this time my checks had come back from the bank. So I made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying Thanks but no thanks. Um. <SEP> Turned out they weren't cheeky. Yeah. They were I tell you. They don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year. So what is it now? It's up to fifty-five on the gold card. It's eighty-five for the Optima. Or I'm sorry no. Fif-. No. Fif-. <SEP> What do you mean fifty-five? You mean fifty-five dollars? Yeah. For the green card. But then what's the interest? Well now that's the card see. <SEP> And interest is like eighteen or something. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's um. Well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any. But on the Optima card it's. Um let's see right now it's running at about. It's not too bad. It's actually it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go. Yeah. Well credit cards. Well they're dangerous. <SEP> You know my parents don't hardly use them. Huh-uh. Mine don't either. Mine don't either. They uh. My mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card. And that's it. I've got all my gas cards because I don't want to carry money around. Yeah. <SEP> I'll do that. Yeah. Now I I do use gas cards. Now Impact is kind of bad too though. Yeah. <SEP> You know. Especially if you get forget to record those little suckers. Yeah. Exactly. Plastic is just too easy. I mean that's the that's the whole problem with it. <SEP> Uh-huh. Um. Well and you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase right. Yeah. <SEP> Of course you got to charge it and keep your cash. Sure. Naturally. That's. I got into all kinds of trouble doing that. What are you saying? Oh my husband says I might buy it. But I I don't really usually consider that an option. <SEP> Well Having having been out of the credit game for some years now I've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it. Maybe that's how we got in trouble. And uh. <SEP> Yeah. But it's hard isn't it? Well it is. But I I I'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint. Well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic. Yeah. Exactly. I I uh I just went out and got a new V C R yesterday with cash. <SEP> With cash? And it it's. Do you work with T I? No. No. I wish I did. <SEP> Yeah. You could have got a discount couldn't you? Yeah. I could use a discount. I have to wait for things to go on sale. <SEP> But there's always a sale. Yeah. Especially on electronic goods. Yeah. Especially now. <SEP> What is that thing I saw. Circuit Circuit World or something. Circuit City. Circuit City. Have you been in there? Yeah. They they're not their prices aren't that terrific. They they used to be. But they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now. <SEP> Oh it's national? Uh-huh. I think I've seen two around Dallas. Yeah. They're they're all over the country now. <SEP> Well what else. They they used to be good. I remember when they first opened up. They did have good bargains. I don't know if you have a place there called uh. Or you probably have something similar. We call it Service Merchandise. Yeah. In Garland. You got Service Merchandise. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. It used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go. And uh Circuit City came along. And that was the place to go to get your T V -s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that. And then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price. And actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now. So. So. So much for Circuit City. <SEP> So. Okay. What else can we talk about? Who do you work for? I don't. I'm a graduate student. I'm a professional student. Sounds wonderful. It is. <SEP> We were talking about that just today. It's great. We could be just lifelong students. It is great. I love it. <SEP> Where are you going to school? N C State. What's that? Uh North Carolina State. <SEP> So you're on Spring Break? Not yet. Ours don't ours doesn't start until uh next week. So where are you? Where am I? <SEP> Yeah. What do you mean where? Oh. In Raleigh. Oh okay. Little. The burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh. What a dead place. <SEP> Is it? Yeah. I've got a nice little business at home. And I sit around and tinker with that most of the time. So what are you getting your degree in? Um uh human factors. <SEP> And what do you do with it? Not a thing. Well what is it? It's it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them. <SEP> So it's sociology. It's well it's more psychology and engineering. Uh. My my master's is in industrial engineering. So you're working on your doctorate? Yeah. <SEP> Oh lord. P H D in human factors. Oh that will that will sound wonderful won't it? Well. <SEP> Get you a little plaque. Oh yeah. I B M uh. I mean uh a lot of people use human factors. Folks. But I B M is what I'm looking at right now. Aren't aren't they laying off several thousand people? They might be. But not at not at the human factors level. They they're. <SEP> Well I heard it on the news today. I could swear it was I B M. No. As a matter of fact the I B M right here or in Carey which is a little suburb of Raleigh just just hired one more human factors person. Um. Doggone it. If they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been. Me. I'm I'm I'm going into thes- or going into the uh dissertation this summer. <SEP> How much longer do you have? And get that done this summer? Uh I'm going to start this summer. I probably won't finish it until the end of the year. <SEP> Ooh. But uh I'm I'm trying to get a uh intern position with I B M right now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in. Because you. It's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field. <SEP> Why? There has been so much work done already? Yeah. That's. That and and it's it's limited application in some respects. Um conside- in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people. Most.
