Uh books. Yes. Mainly I read the Bible these days. <SEP> That's very good. I do too. Good that's great to hear. Uh and Christian literature. Uh-huh. Uh I've kind of. I used to read a lot of uh novels. But it seems as though if you really want to set a t- side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. It does. It. And I I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart. And he really has. It's getting to where a just really want to read it. <SEP> That's good. That's good. It it it's uh it's hard for me to find time also to read. Uh a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that for you know because I don't have a lot of time. But when I do get to sit down and and read I like to read the Bible. And I like to read. I read to my daughter a lot too. Do you? <SEP> And uh I like to read you know Bi-. I have Bible storybooks. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So I like reading those to her. And she really enjoys those. So that's good. And it and it's kind of short because we don't woe don't have a lot of time to to read. Uh-huh. <SEP> So it's real enjoyable. For both of us. Yeah. Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's? <SEP> Frank E. No. I guess I haven't. Uh THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and uh uh I forget the t- the other. Well he uh he's also written a lot of children. How old is your daughter. Five. Five. Okay. He's written some children's books as well. And they're all spiritually uh oriented. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. What's his name again? Peretti. Frank E Peretti. <SEP> Frank E Peretti. P E R E T T I. I have to look for those. Uh-huh. Yeah. Do. Because uh I love to read his his uh children's books just. <SEP> Just to read them. Well that's good. Yeah. Oh they're good. They're great. That's good. And it's like uh uh usually about a family of uh archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like uh uh digging in old ruins and running across like uh the old gods and things. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh. <SEP> Yeah. Oh that sounds pretty neat. Yeah. It is. It's real exciting. <SEP> Oh I'll have to look for those. And it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know. Right. So. <SEP> Well that's neat. Well I I have a. My daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection. Uh-huh. And I like that because it's a it's real easy to uh follow for her. You know uh gosh if if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd never understand any of it. Well it's hard for me. <SEP> That's right. It is it is real hard to to follow and understand. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh I've got a Bible that uh has a little bit of a uh a glossary in the back. And it helps explain who people are. That's that's about the hardest thing is who's related to who. I know it. And especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats. Yeah. <SEP> Yes. Yes. It sure is. But but it is good reading. And it's good for us and and everything. Uh-huh. That's right. <SEP> I really do enjoy it. But uh I also. But then on the other extreme I like to read uh uh I guess ho- I don't know horror Steven King type books. Uh-huh. Yeah. I've read a lot of his too. The. And I I like that. That's good fun reading. Yeah. Can't put them down. <SEP> No. You can't. You really can't. They are good. And ooh they just they're just so suspenseful. Uh-huh. Yeah. I really do enjoy his. Uh there's another guy. Oh what can. What is his name. Oh durn. You would well. You know when you're recording you can't re- remem-. <SEP> I know. Uh oh Dean uh Kratz or Kranz. Or. Judith Krantz? Y-. Who? <SEP> Judith Krantz. I know her. Uh no. It's a guy. Oh okay. And he he writes the same thing though. It's that real gruesome horror stories. <SEP> Oh. Ooh. <SEP> Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Koontz. Uh his last name ends in a Z I know that. Yeah. Oh I think I know who you're talking about. Uh I've seen. I don't think I can pronounce it either. But. Yeah uh. <SEP> Yeah. I'm in a book club. And I think I've seen his books in there. Uh-huh. I've never read any of his. But they're real. I kind of got burnt out on Steven King though. It seems like it's all the. <SEP> Did you ever read the uh uh oh. It's one of his first books THE STAND. Yes. That oh that long thing. I know it. And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that I mean. <SEP> Yeah. They do kind of follow or Are similar. You know that. Uh-huh. I love that book though. I thought it was great. <SEP> Yeah. It really was. And I loved THE SHINING. Ooh yes. That was that was my favorite. Oh those hedges when they started moving. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Whenever they they made that into a movie I was thinking oh my gosh if they show that I'll just die. For some reason that scared me more than anything. <SEP> Yeah. That is. He just brings stuff alive you know. Yeah. You could just visualize everything. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's. And that was a pretty scary movie too. Yeah. I think they did a pretty good job. But they didn't follow it exactly. Yeah. <SEP> But they did give it you know do it justice. Uh-huh. That's right. But uh most of the time they don't with when follow books very well when they make them into movies. Yeah. That's true. I liked IT as well. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah uh. That's another big fat one. I did too. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That was good. I liked uh I also liked uh CUJO. Did you read that one? Yeah. <SEP> And. Except it broke my heart. Yeah. I'm a dog lover. <SEP> Me too. And then uh NIGHT STAND. Is that NIGHT. No. It was uh. <SEP> DEAD DEAD ZONE. That's one I liked. What? DEAD ZONE. Oh yeah. <SEP> That was a. I've read that one too. That was a real good one. He's written a lot of books. <SEP> Boy he just sits down eight hours a day. Just like any other job. I know it. <SEP> Right. And then he has some under uh another name. That he's written. That's right. That one about the Gypsies or that hunger. <SEP> Yeah. Or s- uh. Yeah. Uh I think his name was Bachman. He wrote under the name of Bachman. Yeah. Richard Bachman. <SEP> Yeah. He is really interesting. Yeah. He's so prolific. Yeah. Ooh I wish I could do that. Oh I know it. And I have gone back. And after I I graduated I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit too uh. <SEP> Uh-huh. I do too. I love old good old. Once you can get into the language. You know the l-. <SEP> Yeah. It's like it's English. But it's not the same English they speak today. Right. So it's kind of hard to keep you know at it. But. <SEP> That's true. But I. They're worthwhile. Literature? That's that was one of my favorite subjects in school was uh literature. <SEP> Yeah. Me too. I used to love those old good good old books. Uh-huh. <SEP> I didn't mind doing that at all. Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself. Yeah. Yeah. I liked uh oh. Gosh why can't I think of their names. Uh shoot. The one that wrote uh WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Uh wasn't that Jane Ehre? No. <SEP> No. That was another one. He wrote JANE EHRE too. Yeah. Yeah. Uh well you know who I'm talking about. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Those are good old good old books and classics. Yeah. Uh-huh. That's right. Right. Right. <SEP> Sure is neat. That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen because they'll take a classic and and uh televise it you know put it into a viewing format more or less. Yeah. <SEP> Right. Right. <SEP> A lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays. Uh-huh. I know it's it's really hard for me. I work two jobs and uh have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school myself. Do you? <SEP> So it's it's hard for me to sit down and read. Well I can imagine. But when I do I just just love it. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. <SEP> Well I think we've accomplished five minutes. So. I think we have too. <SEP> Thank you very much. It's good talking to you. You too.
