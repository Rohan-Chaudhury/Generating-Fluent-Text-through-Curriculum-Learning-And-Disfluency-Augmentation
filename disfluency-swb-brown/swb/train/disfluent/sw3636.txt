Motor homes can be a lot of fun. <SEP> Yeah. They really are. Yeah. They really are. I've I've enjoyed it. I've never actually done any uh like tent camping. But uh one of these days I'm going to try that too. Yeah like to go visit uh the national parks and state parks and and uh just get out and see nature. Uh that can be a lot of fun too. <SEP> Yeah. How about you? Well so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping. <SEP> Uh-huh. This summer we went to uh the Smokey Mountain National Park. And uh stayed about three or four days in there. Oh how great. It was wonderful. <SEP> Oh yeah. Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable. Um. And the days were nice and warm. And it was beautiful beautiful few days. <SEP> Uh-huh. That's great. It worked out particularly well especially considering she was what six months pregnant. Uh-huh. So I don't know. <SEP> It worked pretty well. It was one of those uh those dome type pop up tents. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Nice and quick and easy to put up. <SEP> Yeah. Packs away nice and small. And about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto. Well that's true. That's true. It was a lot of fun. <SEP> I guess the last real uh camping trip I took was has been a couple years ago. Oh yeah? Uh I went to California up to the Sequoias. Wow. That's got to be beautiful territory. <SEP> Yeah. It's gorgeous. I love the big trees. Just just the drive up through uh up the coast line and then cut over in into the into the parks it's gorgeous though. Yeah. What like Sequoia National Park? <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh. Uh-huh. Yeah. I had been there before when I lived in California. But that's my first trip back in oh goodness um um thirty years maybe. Yeah. <SEP> But that is God's country. It has to be. Yeah. Yeah. Do they still have the uh the scenic uh roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees? <SEP> Uh no. They don't. They. The last one well. The first time I was there the the tree was still standing. But it has since come down. Okay. Yeah. But they are huge. If you've never seen them it's it's very awe inspiring.

Oh yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. They seem to be trailing out quickly. <SEP> Yeah. Because there is lots to see. There is course the the Grand Canyon. And uh the Painted Desert is is real pretty in a different sort of way. Yes. And course the the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone. And uh the Grand Tetons are gorgeous too. I imagine. <SEP> Yeah. I would imagine they are. Course I I guess I'm partial to big tree country.
