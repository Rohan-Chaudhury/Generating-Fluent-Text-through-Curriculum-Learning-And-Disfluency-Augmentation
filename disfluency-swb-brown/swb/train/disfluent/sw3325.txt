Okay. Well do you have a pet? I have two cats. And do and oh and two fish. Two cats. You're lucky. <SEP> Your two fish. And what do you have? Well my husband. You know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing. <SEP> Oh no. My husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog. So we have a black Labrador. Ooh. Beautiful gorgeous black Labrador. But to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm. <SEP> Right. Does he sleep in your house? And. Well because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind uh he sleeps in the laundry room. And then he goes out for the day. But this this is a beautiful dog. And he is wonderful with our little girls. And he is he's comes from a purebred line. And there's nothing you could say bad about him except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle. <SEP> Right. Right. And this is huge. You know course when he runs around the yard he just digs. He doesn't know that he's tearing up things. But he does. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And the worst part that I had with him he's he's three now was when he was uh about eight months old. Uh-huh. And I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one. And I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour. And I came home. And he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall. <SEP> Oh my word. And it was in the floor. And I just about lost it. And I called. And I said come home and get your dog. And so he said well puppies just chew when they're nervous and I well I wish you had told me you know. Oh dear. And it was about eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum. He kept picking at it. And I didn't kn-. The the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it. So the last thing he did was when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch. And I told my husband. I said you know it's either me or the dog. And he looked at me like well you know. <SEP> Good-bye. He loves this dog. And every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him. And he's a good dog. So it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to. And that's why I laughed when they called with the topic. I thought oh boy do I have a pet. But I I grew up with cats. And I'm very comfortable. <SEP> I love my cats. Yeah. I had one cat for eighteen years. I got her when I lived in Hawaii. Oh. <SEP> Before I even got married I had my cat. She's old. Well she I had to have her put to sleep last June. Isn't she? <SEP> Oh I started to say. Then you broke your heart. <SEP> Oh it was awful. It was just awful. Oh. But and she just sat there on my lap you know. Oh. <SEP> She just just waited. And. Bless your heart. Oh it was awful. That makes me feel so bad. <SEP> But her hair. But the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband's shoes. Yeah. Oh no. You know and she just liked his shoes. And he'd have these dress sh- hundred dollar shoes. Oh. <SEP> Oh no. Oh it was just bad. <SEP> And my closet. And it was oh something. Oh that's awful. I never heard of that before. Oh it was terrible. And once she did it you know then she would I mean she wouldn't. If our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husband's shoes. Uh-huh. <SEP> She must have known he didn't like her or something. Or the smell or something. Oh anyway I I. And I would shut I would bar the closet doors and would car- vac- uh clean the carpets. <SEP> And. Uh-huh. Oh dear it was just awful. Well d- now does your cat sleep in the house? <SEP> That was very funny. They are they are house cats. I uh well I have two cats right now. Yeah. <SEP> And of course. Oh yeah. Good. They sleep with my kids. My kids my my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat. Oh. <SEP> But the cat doesn't destruct does it? See it doesn't do anything. Oh no I I'm not going to have a dog. See. <SEP> We've had two dogs. And uh they both got ran over. After we had them for several years just nice little outside dogs. Oh no. But. Yeah. <SEP> Were just my kids' friends. They would go jog- they would go with me when I would go running. And and the last one got hit uh as she was following my one of my sons across the road to the school. Oh. Oh no. <SEP> It was awful. It was just. Oh that is. And it just it's too heartbreaking. But they do dig up. And they just they just wreck things. And I'm not a dog person. They do wreck things. <SEP> Well I'm not either. Ooh. I'm not either. And it's just been. <SEP> I wouldn't want a Lab. It sounds beautiful. But. He's beautiful. But it's just one of those concessions I just had to make. <SEP> But I kind of ignore him. Now today's the first cold we've had in Texas. And it's really cold and drizzly. And it's freezing. Um. And people are doing their fires. And I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there. And he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square. And he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me I won't make any trouble you know. <SEP> And then my daughters both have hamsters. Oh. And I I. <SEP> And how old are your girls? They're eleven and eight. And I gave in at Christmas. Oh yeah. And they have they keep their cages real clean. It always smells of cedar. And they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and. <SEP> Sure. I think they're cutting us off. No. That's. Oh. <SEP> Somebody's trying to cut in on my line. And I don't want to answer. Oh okay. I'll just wait. Okay. <SEP> No. I've I've got incoming calls. And I don't know why -body's calling. Oh okay. I I hate to cut it off. I think they would cut us off. I understand. <SEP> So we'll just wait. Okay. Well. Whoever it is will call back. They'll cut us off pretty soon. <SEP> Well it's somebody calling for my kids you know. Jeez. Yeah. I know. Actually it's my son. I know it is. <SEP> My older boy. He never likes to come home from school. Anyway that's what we have. And I have I've tried to start a fish tank. How does. And I keep losing all my fish. In the salt water? <SEP> Salt water or. No. Yeah. <SEP> Just regular water.
