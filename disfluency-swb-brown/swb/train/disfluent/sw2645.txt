So the general topic is hobbies. Yes. Let's hear about your hobbies. <SEP> Well let's see. What kind of hobbies do I have? I guess uh I it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing. I enjoy playing basketball and and basically all kinds of sports. And uh. Any handicrafts? Excuse me. Any handicrafts? <SEP> No. Not not really um. No. I'm really not too creative. Well I uh you know around with my hands and things like that. I leave that more up to my Mom. So um I think I'm in handicraft. Oh yeah. I think it will become resume writing. <SEP> Oh well let's hope that you you aren't employed by that craft for too long. Uh yeah. I I hate to think about it. And and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads. Uh-huh. Yeah. It it. <SEP> Wh- what kind of time frame is it uh looking for the uh different shifts up there? I. Who knows. Is it uh. Basically I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it Texas. No. All means about fifteen to twenty percent of of oh. <SEP> Oh wow. I'm sure the number's s- somewhere classified. But some of the internal news and the news services. So it's approximately six fifty. Uh-huh. So ten percent of six fifty is sixty-five. And twenty percent would be one thirty. <SEP> Wow. How about that. Yeah. That's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney. Yeah. That's possible. How about that. Well that's uh that's unfortunate. Is there many other. Are you in the defense? Oh yes. <SEP> Is it uh many other corporations in the area? Uh I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring. Well I'm sure with the new uh aw- contract awarding. I I think it went to Lockheed didn't it? Yes. <SEP> That uh I hear they're hiring all over the place for that. Yeah uh. No. Apple's coming to town. And and that has some opportunities. Oh really? And uh and. <SEP> Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs? Colorado Springs specifically. Yes. How about that. And uh and uh M C I -s coming if if telemarketing is your bag. <SEP> Uh-huh. Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death. But. Well you in the uh computer operations or in the actual uh manufacturing? Uh I'm a defense worker. I'm government tool control specialist. <SEP> Right. Yeah. That's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also. Are you still employed? Am I still employed by T I. No. I took a leave of of T I back in November. Oh. <SEP> Actually December was my first month away from them. Exempt or? Exempt. Oh yes. <SEP> It uh unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't uh it was purely by my own choice. It wasn't uh there was no incentive for myself to leave. But it was just an opportunity arose. And decided to take it. Oh so you didn't even get the severance package. No. I should have taken the the the you know uh option when that was there. But it was just I missed it by a couple months. But you know what can one do. I'm just happy still to have a job. So are you happy with what you are doing now? <SEP> Yeah. I am kind of happy with it. It's getting better all the time. I knew it would be different from the very beginning. But you know as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system. So I was in the computer operations. It's uh you know it all starts to become similar. There's you know there's benefits. And there's things that weren't as good. Yeah. But as an overall package I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out. Good. Good. Well it hasn't been a long time T I. Or I I'm significantly shaken by the situation but not devastated. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that is more in the support of the manufacturing. And there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de- the defense area but manufacturing in general. To tell you the truth I'm I'm I'm not really worried. Uh-huh. That's great. That's good. And and I seem rather happy about it most of the time just just to know what's possibilities are you know what might happen. <SEP> Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah. <SEP> Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table. But still in all it feels funny. It may be a blessing in disguise. <SEP> I know a number of people who are uh surplused. And they're just. Actually what the positions that they found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside. So despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains I can't seem to get into it right now. Exactly. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well I'm sure it's just with the the the the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec- decide on a pass. Uh situational. I've I doubt I'll be here in six months. Uh-huh. Well would you like to be there? I. All things being equal yes. <SEP> Uh-huh. But or or even somewhere better. Sure. But God this is much better than west Texas. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well just take the day. But then they they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas. Well actually uh the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice. I my little brother lives in Austin right now. <SEP> Oh that's a beautiful place. Goes to U T. Uh-huh. That's just fantastic down there. Take it more as a. This is your opportunity to do whatever you want. Pick out where you want to live. And then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do. I see that's the problem. For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do and where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Sure. And now I feel lost. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's a. It it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it. Oh I had job offers. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave. And that. Uh-huh. Well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something. If you don't like it shoot move on to something else. That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here. I'll take a chance. If I don't like it I'll go someplace else do something different. Oh so had you been with T I long when you changed? <SEP> Five years. Huh. Well there's a noticeable difference there. Yeah. I've been with them sixteen. <SEP> Yeah. I can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes. Actually seventeen now. And oh yeah. Momentum is uh driving force in our lives. Uh-huh. But so yeah. I'm looking as as a opportunity. <SEP> Well that's good. You've got a good attitude about it. And and I'm looking at it as a change. Uh-huh. And I'm looking at it as as an adventure. <SEP> Right. There you go. That's the way to do it. And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then. There you go. That's the thing to do. That's much funner than doing any kind of job. Ha how about we end this? <SEP> That will work out just fine. Nice talking to you. All right. Nice talking to you. Bye. <SEP> Good-bye.
