So how is the weather out there? Uh it's really cold. And it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold. And they've gotten more snow than they've ever had. Oh really? <SEP> You have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff. How about you guys? Um. Uh it's just it's a it's about same. The usual I think. Oh. So nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff. It's good. <SEP> Yeah. Well the weather let's see well the snow here is different from Utah's. Because I have lived in Utah for like ten years. Oh really? What part? And uh. Provo. I was going to B Y U. Oh really? Okay. <SEP> Yeah. And uh the snow is like really cold. I mean it's like really humid. So it seems wetter or something like that. It's. It's more humid in Utah than there? Uh-huh. Or there? <SEP> It's more humid in Iowa than Utah. Okay. Right. <SEP> Yeah. Okay. And it seems like when the winds blow it's really it goes right through you. It's really different from Utah's weather. I thought Utah was cold. But I think Iowa is a lot colder. Yeah. See that's how it is in Texas too. Because when it's cold it's really cold. So. <SEP> Yeah. I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. What's that? I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. Right. Yeah. So the humidity is I think what does it. <SEP> Yeah. I think that's true. Because I I noticed when I got here too. Because like I'd. When it would snow in Texas uh I would just I mean we'd be f- really cold. Uh-huh. And we'd have to get really warm. And here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing. And you don't you don't feel super cold. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's true. It was weird. Yeah. But so how long ago did you graduate? Or did you. Or. <SEP> Uh I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven. Oh really? Yeah. My husband got his doctorate at B Y U. So that's. And so he just graduated this past year. Oh. So you just barely moved away? <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. We really miss Well we really miss Utah. Do you like it out there? We miss the mountains. You do? <SEP> Yeah. Because it's like really flat here. Well not flat but hilly. But no big mountains or anything. Uh-huh. So you just moved away a year ago? <SEP> Uh in August. Wow really recent. Yeah. But uh see see what else can I say about the weather. Uh well today was warmer. It was like forty-five. Oh warm. <SEP> So what's the temperature up today over there? Oh man. It's got to be like it's probably fifty fifty-five maybe. Oh really? Maybe not that warm. Probably about uh. Yeah. It's not it's not that cold really. <SEP> And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill. Yeah. But they talk about wind chill here all the time. Yeah. That's a big deal in Texas too. <SEP> They said it could be like six degrees out and like negative forty-one wind chill. Um. So that's what we're not used to. Yeah. That's true. That makes a big difference. Huh. <SEP> So oh I. So did you used to ski when you were out here? What's that? Did you used to ski when you were in Utah? <SEP> Oh I've only I've only skied in Utah once. Oh really? I only skied once my whole life. <SEP> But do you do a lot of skiing there? Uh not tons. But I like to when I get a chance. Uh-huh. I've only been once so far but had the opportunity a couple times since then. Just saving my money for Christmas things and that. <SEP> Yeah. So is this your first year in Utah? Uh no. This is actually my third year. <SEP> And you're going to school there? Uh-huh. Oh. Yep. <SEP> At U of U. Or. No. At B Y U. Oh really? Yeah. <SEP> Oh. So but I'll be here a long time at this rate. What's your major? Uh it was nursing. But I'm in the process of changing it right now. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh. Because it's really really competitive at B Y U. Yeah. You have to have like a three seven to get in. So It's really. <SEP> That's true. I'm going to look into some other fields. I'd like. All the science classes and that I'm just not really enjoying too much. So I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school. Uh-huh. So. <SEP> Yeah. That's that's a good idea. Did you graduate in a certain field. Or. Uh education. I got a double major. In. <SEP> Uh elementary and special ed. Really? Uh-huh. That what my sister did. <SEP> Oh really? Yeah. You might know her. Here name is Lori Bird. Maybe not. I think she graduated around then too though eighty-seven probably. But she got her doc-. Yeah. Well I can't. There are so many girls in all my classes. I can't remember how many people. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Because they since uh stopped that program. I mean where you can where you can get it double pretty easily. Oh have they? <SEP> Oh. I mean it's it's really.
