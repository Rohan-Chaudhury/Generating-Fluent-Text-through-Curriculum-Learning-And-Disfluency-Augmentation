All right. Uh how long have they been recycling there in Virginia? Um actually quite a a a while. Um I've lived here for six years. And can you hold on just a second? Yeah. Uh-huh. <SEP> Hello. Uh-huh. Oh I'm sorry. I must have got the other line cut off. Uh so they've been doing that it for a while now. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh it. I live in an apartment. Uh-huh. And my ap- facilities. There it is. Hold on. Uh-huh. Hello. <SEP> Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah. Okay. You're okay. Yeah. Okay. <SEP> Uh anyhow they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only. Uh I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and at ano- ano- another public facility where they have you know recycling of glass uh aluminum and paper. Uh-huh. Now. Have you have you cycled recycled plastic also? <SEP> No. And that's what I I don't understand exactly why they don't have that option. We we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way. Uh-huh. They had some bends around that we could find and put them in. <SEP> Uh-huh. But not all that many. It wasn't very well advertised. Uh-huh. But recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things. <SEP> Uh-huh. So it it should be good uh. Uh-huh. I think it's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when I just think of the papers that I dump out. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean there just. It's such a. I waste. I just hate to think about it. Yeah. Now an additional thing is uh. Where I work they also have recycling there of uh all white paper and of you know cans also. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. So I mean a lot of people you know right at the vending machines they have receptacles that you know you can just pop your cans in. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. And near the Xerox machines they have places you know for your paper. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. You know I keep a little box at my desk you know. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I just throw as I'm using the white paper you know I just throw it right in there. Uh. And then you know they have someone that comes around and pick it up you know every afternoon which you know is an excellent idea at work because I know the amount paper they go through there. Yeah. That's neat. <SEP> Yeah. Because. Yeah. That's right. I guess one of the things I think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about about it. <SEP> Uh-huh. There's needs to be more public uh service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening. Yeah. I would agree with that. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And there's. <SEP> Right. I've seen a few things but not very much really. Uh-huh. And I I think that's a shame. They need to uh do a little more. I'd like to know for instance when I when they say uh plastic all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to. <SEP> Exactly. Uh-huh. Uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use. I don't know. <SEP> Uh-huh. But I I'd be glad to organize it if that they'd tell me what it is I'm doing because that would that would be really helpful. Uh-huh. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. Yeah. I agree with you there. Another thing that I like here which is. I do with. I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that uh. Their aluminum cans is for uh Children's Hospital for a burn fund. Uh-huh. <SEP> So all the monies are donated you know for the recycling to Children's Hospital which I think is an excellent idea there you know because the other public. Yeah. Uh-huh. That's great. <SEP> Now that gives you a little bit of incentive there. <SEP> Right. Right. Uh-huh. And before even at work. Before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year I had had everyone in my department recycling. And you know I would have them drop right drop their cans off in my office. Saving them for you uh. <SEP> And then I would haul them you know here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund which got people really going into it. Uh-huh. I think that's right. <SEP> But. I think I think helping us be more enthu- enthusiastic about it helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. That. There you go. Making sure. <SEP> That's for sure. But I I think that's. Right I think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh ad- advertisement and letting public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and what what happens to it because I think that's that would help a lot. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I'm sure you know in the near future I would think they would be coming out with more. Yeah. You know I've seen a definite trend you know towards more recycling everywhere you know even at McDonald's you know with their their use of no foam containers anymore. Yeah. I. <SEP> Yeah. Yes. I I'm glad to see some of these things I think. <SEP> Right. I think I think it is getting more you know advertisement. People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped. <SEP> Right. Uh-huh. And all these things that. <SEP> Right. I think that's true. Well I think. I'm that's about my uh some on recycling. Yeah. But I I enjoyed talking to you. <SEP> Okay. Well I did too. Uh-huh. All right. Bye now. Okay. Bye-bye.
