Okay. Okay. Um well I'm not. I mean I read a lot. But I don't I don't read a whole. I mean uh eh eh eh I I I I tend to read like only out of a couple you know groups. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh and I'm a uh I'm a big baseball fan. So I tend to read a lot of the baseball books. And. I'm a big baseball fan too. Oh okay. <SEP> And uh I read a lot of science fiction. E-. Well I like. I teach school. And so during the school year I just don't have time to read. And I you know I would love to to be able to read more because I I enjoy it so much. But with correcting papers and and I two o- kids of my own I just don't have time. But in the summer I try to read a lot. Uh-huh. <SEP> And and of course being a woman I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot. I just. I really enjoy that because it's kind of a a getaway type thing. Uh-huh. So I I read a lot of that. But I also love sports. And uh uh I I don't have time to read in. But I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED i- during the the year because my son gets that. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh but uh I don't read a lot of nonfiction. And I really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would would be benefit me greatly. But I just don't. Uh-huh. Yeah. I um I don't really I pro- probably should. I don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that. I uh um I'll get like uh books on history and stuff like that that look interesting. And I uh of course I don't ever get around to reading them. Yeah. Yeah. You know I got uh um. I b- I belong to Quality Paperback Book Club. <SEP> Oh do you? And I'll get get stuff out of that. Like I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM you know like a couple of years ago. Uh-huh. And I started reading and got about sixty pages into it. And it's like eight hundred pages. <SEP> Oh my word. And it was like uh I want to read something else for a while. Yeah. It's i-. Some of those books are real tough to get into. But after you get into them they're really good. Yeah. <SEP> But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so. Yeah. Well especially you know well. BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off you know in the eighteen forties you know. And it's like. Yeah. Wait the war wasn't until the eightee- you know. It's like okay. And I realize these things you know. These things take awhile like to move up. But it's you know it's hard sometimes. <SEP> It's right. That's right. I find though that if when I find an author. Uh and you don't read a lot of fiction you said. But when I find. I read a lot of science fiction. Do you? Yeah. <SEP> When I find an author I really like I try to read everything they write. Because you you get used to their style and you really enjoy it. Yeah. That and. I I do the same thing. I. Yeah. Uh there's one science fiction writer named uh Allen Dean Foster. <SEP> Uh-huh. I've heard of him. Oh okay. Yeah. He um. I must have like fifty or sixty books by him. Is that right? I mean I have you know I have everything he's ever well almost everything he's ever done. <SEP> Uh-huh. And um you know I I know that when I you know when I get his book I'm I'm usually going to enjoy it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um so it's really you know. It's it's fun to to do that. Uh. <SEP> Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction? I think that's unbelievable. Yeah. Well he does a lot of like um uh movie adaptations and things like that. Oh does he really? Yeah. And uh his adaptations are usually really good. <SEP> Oh. Um it's it's funny he um. The the novelization of STAR WARS was list-. You know it it was out in the uh in the stores as being by George Lucas. But it turns out that uh Foster actually uh ghost wrote it for him. Is that right? Wh- which you know. When I read it I should have realized that because I mean it had Foster's style written all over it. <SEP> Is that right? Yeah. Uh-huh. Well I I've never read anything of his. But I've heard about him. But wouldn't you think he would. Does he get some royalties from that hopefully? Oh I'm sure he does. <SEP> Well I would think he would. I'd hope so. Well I mean he's doing all right probably. Oh I'm sure he is. I'm sure he is. But sometimes the more you get the more you want too. So. Yeah. That's true. <SEP> Yeah. Well yeah. You you're a baseball fan. You're you're aware of that kind of thing. Oh yeah. Oh right. Right. Right. I in fact I'm a sports fan period. Uh-huh. <SEP> We. I mean th- that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much. Because there's everything in it. Yeah. I had a uh had a subscription to that last year. But I'm uh I'm mostly a baseball fan. So I'm I'm not as inter- you know. Oh. The other stuff is interesting. But um I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff. <SEP> So you're probably uh a Baltimore fan right an Oriole fan? Uh actually I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything. Is that right? Yeah. <SEP> Boston? Oh well that's good too. Um but uh I I I do like the Orioles also. I'm I'm sure you do. Well I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here. Yeah. <SEP> But I I was uh. I'm not from here. I'm originally from Ohio. So I've always followed the Tigers. Because you know I was I was born and raised in Toledo. Toledo. Yeah. I was in Toledo last summer. Went to a uh to a Mud Hens double header. <SEP> Oh I love the Mud Hens. They're great. I love the name. And there was a b- really big article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED last year. Yeah. Y-. I saved that issue actually. <SEP> Did you? Um that's when I had the subscription. Yeah. It was a lot of fun. <SEP> Yeah. I li-. I really enjoy that team. I we used to go there all the time. I used to live in Iowa too. And they have the Iowa Oaks. And we used to go go to their games all the time. And. They don't exist anymore. I don't think. I know I know they don't. <SEP> At least not by that name. There's the Iowa Cubs. But I don't know if they play in the same location. Oh they must they must have changed then. Because it used well. <SEP> I haven't lived there for l-. I've been here for like twelve years now. So. And I haven't been back to Des Moines in a long time. But we used to always go to their games. Um. And it was kind of fun. It's almost uh more fun than going to a major league game. I don't know. I just really enjoy the farm teams. I. Minor league baseball I think is a lot more fun than major league baseball. <SEP> Yes. <SEP> It is. It's not quite so serious you know. And it's a lot cheaper. That's for sure. That's for sure. Yeah. There's um there's a city just west of Freder- of uh Baltimore called Frederick. <SEP> It's about forty miles west. Is that right? And they have a minor league team. And I go out there almost as much as the Orioles. And um. <SEP> Is that right? I. It's just a lot of fun. I mean it's free parking. And three bu- bu- you know four bucks now to get in. And you know the hot dogs are a dollar. And and it's just great. Well how like how much is an Oriole game? Oriole game? If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium it's four bucks. The ticket the ch- the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty. <SEP> Oh gosh. See it's higher than the Rangers. Yeah. And um hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty. Oh yeah. A-. The food here is outrageous. But uh you can get a good seat for uh well. It used to be three dollars. But I think it's gone up to fo- four dollars this year. Oh that's nice. <SEP> But you know it's in the bleachers way out in the you know in center field. But it's still nice. Yeah. You still can see well. And uh we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets you know box seats or something then we usually sit out there. Uh-huh. <SEP> Well how much are the box seats there? Do you know offhand? Box seats run from oh like eight dollars to twelve dollars. Yeah. That's um that's a little steeper. I think the uh most expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks. But we're getting a new stadium next year. So. <SEP> Oh so it'll go up. Yeah. It'll go up. And if it opens. It's uh something we're really irritated about around here. Or some people are really irritated about. They're they're building this new sta- they built the new stadium downtown. And they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium. Uh-huh. But I park for free up at at Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free. <SEP> Oh oh. And um I'm not going to be able to do that downtown. Uh that's yeah that's a bummer. Yeah. We. <SEP> Well see baseball here though is the cheapest game in town. Because the Cowboys. It's out- it's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game. Uh-huh. And the Mavericks are t-. It's high too. Uh-huh. <SEP> So baseball's cheap compared to other games. Weren't you guys supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas? <SEP> Well that didn't go s- over now. Oh it d- it didn't go through. They they they decided you know George Bush who who's the main owner of the Rangers decided that uh they'd stay in Arlington. <SEP> So Arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one. Oh okay. So we're going to they're going to stay there. Which is fine because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer. And and that was their main main money making you know deal for the city. Uh-huh. <SEP> And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away. Yeah. Because everything. There's Six Flags right by the stadium there's a Wet'n Wild. And and it you know that's. Uh-huh. <SEP> All the tourists come there. Uh-huh. And and they. It would have been devastated. They would have collapsed. So I'm kind of glad they're staying there. Because it's right in the middle of Fort Worth-Dallas. And you know. Yeah. That's that's what I'd always heard. I've uh. <SEP> Yeah. We you know we I like it there. And I think Dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything. So I'm glad that they're staying in Arlington. Uh-huh. And it's takes us maybe uh we- well thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from Plano which is not too bad at all. Yeah. That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial. <SEP> Yeah. Um it's actu- it actually funny that um I live just outside of Baltimore. So. And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick but as it does to go to the the ballpark in Me- in uh Baltimore. Because um to go out to Frederick I just jump on the Interstate. <SEP> Is that right? And. Because I live just south of the Interstate. Uh-huh. H- hop on the Interstate. And the stadium's right off the Interstate. <SEP> Oh gosh. So it's like I drive west. And I'm there. And you know and then to go into Baltimore I mean it well it's fewer miles. But I've got to go stop and go traffic and everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you read um. I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED. But you don't read many sports books. Or. <SEP> Well not really. Now my son does. I have I have a son that just turned sixteen. Uh-huh. And he reads everything he gets he gets his get his hands on. He's reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle fan. Um. Huh. <SEP> He's a basketball fan because he he plays for the high school he goes to. And uh just loves D- Dick Vitelle which not many people do. So but he's reading it. And he's r-. And he says He's so interesting Mom. You just can't believe all the things he's done. <SEP> And he's really enjoying that. And I. And he said Mom you need to read it after I get finished. So maybe I will. There was uh I understand there was a really good basketball b- book called uh A SEASON ON THE BRINK. I never heard that one. Yeah. I'm not sure. I don't know. I'm trying to think of the guy's name. It was like John Feinstein or something like that wrote it. <SEP> Uh-huh. I just heard about it the other night. Huh. Uh I was listening to something on the radio about uh you know a talk show about sports books. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And they and they mentioned that one. <SEP> I'll have to tell my son about that. I'm sure he'd like it. Yeah. And uh I was thinking about. There was a I saw a book kicking around on the history of the A B A which. Oh that would be good. Yeah. I get in to even when I don't like the sport so much I get interested in the history of sports franchises.
