Well what are your hobbies? Well actually my hobbies now are T shirt making. I'm making T shirts and sweat shirts. In fact that's what I was doing when you called. Well that sounds interesting. What kinds of uh sweat shirts and T shirts do you make? <SEP> Um right now I'm making Christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing. Okay. Is that silk screening or. <SEP> Um no. I'm have material that I cut out. And then you um. There's this stuff called Wonder Under that you un- that you iron it on. And then you iron that on the T shirt and you paint around it. Oh I see. So it's real fun. I started doing it as a um just something fun to do. And now I'm selling them and pretty. Well how's it going? <SEP> Pretty good. I just started last week. And I sold seven. I didn't wasn't expecting that. So. Well that sounds great. I guess in my spare time I'll be making T shirts. So. Well somebody has to do it. <SEP> That's right you know. Give you a little Christmas money any way. That's correct. Well what are your hobbies? Well I I kind of have hobby fads I guess. <SEP> Uh-huh. When I was growing up I was was into coin collecting. And that dropped off about the time I hit puberty I guess. And then my hobbies in high school went just to the sports. Now my latest one is classic cars. I've I had a sixty-six Mustang I was rebuilding. Um. Almost had it done. And I went on went ahead and sold it. <SEP> Oh my gosh. But it was fun. I really enjoyed it. Well how'd you learn to do that to fix them up? Oh you just. <SEP> You just get a book that tells you how to do it or what? No. You just kind of. All I did is uh I bought the car. And then uh you know you can. I uh was just in a supermarket. And I seen a a magazine for you know. Basically it it was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE. And and so I bought it. Uh-huh. And they had uh some names some companies that sold mustang parts. And I just started ordering some parts. And and you know basically you know I what I did was I redid the whole interior. I didn't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the the whole interior and then part of the exterior. Just kind of do it. <SEP> Where'd you get the car? Well we lived we lived in South Dakota. And I bought it up there before I moved down here. Wow. So it was it was kind of rusted out there. There isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here. <SEP> Well that's true. That's true. Well that sounds neat. Well gee I guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies. Let's see. That that about covers mine. And T shirt making about covers yours. <SEP> Well let's see. I've done other hobbies. I'm a hobby person. I've always done a lot of craft stuff. I always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that. And I collect dolls. I have a huge collection of dolls which is still in New Mexico with my parents. In New Mexico? Uh-huh. From New Mexico. Okay. <SEP> So. Let's see. What else? I started collecting music boxes. I guess that's a hobby. Yeah. That is. So. That's interesting. How many music boxes do you have? <SEP> Probably o- uh about twenty. Do they all play different songs. Uh-huh. Or do some of them play the same song? <SEP> They they all play different songs. Well that's neat. What's the most expensive one you bought? The most expensive. I don't know. I've gotten all of them for gifts. I don't. Oh really. <SEP> Bought a few of them. I usually get them for Christmas gifts or and like when people go you know to on trips or something. Well that's interesting. It used to be tea spoons was the thing. That's true. I never collected those never collected those. Well that's interesting music boxes. <SEP> I have dolls from all over too. That I started when I was a little girl. And I have a lot of dolls. People would always bring them when they go to the countries. And um and I did that when I went to Europe one summer. I bought a doll everywhere we went. So. Well how was Europe? <SEP> Economy. It was great. It was quick. I was in I was in high school. And I was in a tour. And we went all. It's kind of a it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries. And um it was called People to People. And we'd stay in people's homes. And then we got to also tour big cities. And I really enjoyed it. Was that in high school. Uh-huh. Or was that a college thing? <SEP> In was in high school. So I'd like to go back because we had you know. Everything was rushed. I bet. Everything was like an hour or two hours at the Louvre you know things like that where you need the whole day. But but it really. Right. <SEP> That's where a camcorder would come in handy. Exactly. That's true. Well that sounds real neat. So you you haven't been back to Europe since then huh? <SEP> No. I always thought I would. But who knows now. I got married and maybe some day. Maybe it's one of those retirement things. There you go. Well does you husband uh. What does he think of your uh T shirts and. Well he likes it all right.
