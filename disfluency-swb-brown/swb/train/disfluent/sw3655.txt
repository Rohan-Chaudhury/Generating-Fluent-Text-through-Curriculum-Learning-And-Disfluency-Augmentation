So uh what do you think about child care. Oh well my my feelings on it is uh I wouldn't take a child to day-care. You know? Right. <SEP> I mean I'd I'd wind up uh. Just a baby-sitter in a home. Probably find someone. How come you wouldn't take them to a day-care? Uh. Just because of the. <SEP> Well too many kids and and I think too many infections and things coming in. Yeah. They seem to pass a lot of. Yeah. Sicknesses and. I don't know. Then all the things you hear about them. Yeah. You kind of wonder whether or not. <SEP> Yeah. I mean I'm sure there's some good ones. But I just. I don't think that I would uh. I took uh Cammy to a oh. It was a preschool day-care type of thing. Oh uh-huh. But I kind of I liked it some ways. And some ways I didn't. Uh I think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important. <SEP> Oh yeah. Yeah. And. How was it? Well I think they had a they had two teachers. And I think there were twenty kids. But I only had her going two days. And most of the other kids were going more days. So that was probably my own fault that she didn't. <SEP> Oh. She went. Oh you know one thing I noticed is uh uh just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name. And uh I didn't notice it until this summer when I was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural sh- form. <SEP> Oh she did? Yes. And uh I was kind of m- mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or or uh tried to say look you're holding your. She was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff. Sh- but she was. Wrapping her arm all the way around. Yes. <SEP> Yeah. And uh I hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point. She was four or three. Yeah. She was uh it was last year. And uh then this summer I got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on. And I w-. Like I said I didn't notice it till then. Because I hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that. Oh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well they'd never picked it out though? No. <SEP> Huh. They never. Or just never said anything. Course like I said I took her two days a week. And maybe that was. My main reason for taking her was uh just social skills more than anything else. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I felt she needed the s-. Just I didn't feel like she was mature enough socially. <SEP> Yeah. And uh. Well one thing that's kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a a infant or to at a day-care where they're taken care of. Uh-huh. <SEP> Oh yeah. I think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know. Preschool's a different thing. But I think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know and or unless you have awfully good references. Reliable uh people. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long. Well I think it's hard to leave them. It is. It is. The older ones it's not. You don't even really have any real worries because you know that they'll play with whoever's there. And they usually adapt pretty well. <SEP> Yeah. But uh. Yeah. It it is I think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will. Well and you know their kind of their schedules. And you know if they're upset and that type of a deal. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how uh people uh that have young kids working work full time and and do it really without being stressed out all the time. I think it's well. I don't know. Then then on the other hand I think it's harder to stay home in some regards. It's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive. And at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess. And you haven't got anything done. And. Oh yeah. What am I going to fix for supper. <SEP> Oh yeah. It is. Yeah. It's kind of hard to always feel gosh. What. Is this important what I'm doing. And. Yeah. Well uh the work never ends. No. <SEP> That's for sure. No. It It doesn't. So. <SEP> Huh. But I think for taking kids to a probably people that take them to uh preschools and day-cares full time oh. They would I don't know probably just feel a different uh. I think I just think it would be hard to do that full time. I feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that. Are they driving the baby-sitter crazy. And you know. Uh-huh. Or is everything okay.
