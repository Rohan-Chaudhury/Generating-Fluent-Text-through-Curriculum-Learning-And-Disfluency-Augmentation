Okay. Uh we're going to talk about our lawn and gard- garden chores. Do you have either one? Well I don't do anything with the lawn really. But I do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening. Do you. <SEP> Oh really? Um I. We have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden. And that's fun. Well actually Wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because um we enjoy that. We love fresh vegetables in the summer. And it's just one of the things I enjoy doing. So do I. I would. I had rather be outside than than inside any day. <SEP> So would I. Do you work during the week uh outside the home? Yes. I do. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward. I work for a school system. So I'm able to do that um because I get home a little earlier. Yes. And I can still do some some sorts of things. But. Or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight. <SEP> Oh absolutely. Well I unfortunately am not gardening this year. I love gardening. In fact I was prevented at like tw- no about thirty years ago with a life membership uh from the Richmond Virginia counsel of garden clubs. Wow. And it wasn't because I was so good. But I organized a very large garden club. But I still have uh. <SEP> Oh that's wonderful. It well it's always something that seems so odd to me. But uh. But that that's. And you really feel you can accomplish something. And to help other people too that's neat. Yes. It has really nothing to do with uh actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that. <SEP> Uh-huh. It was just that I happened to organize this group that was about seventy people. Right. <SEP> That's wonderful. That. Isn't. Yeah. That that. Yeah. Those numbers were were great. But it. <SEP> Yeah. Well I think it sounds good. I've never belonged to a garden club because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own. I've never had the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format. Yes. But I know people who do it and and enjoy it very much. Well and actually I think that most women's garden clubs that I've been aware of in the past uh are only flowers. What I would like. We've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma. Just moved to to North Carolina. <SEP> Oh. And uh we were orig- originally of course from this area from Virginia. But uh in North uh. In Oklahoma it's the men's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join. My word. And you would have because they do all kinds of uh gardening and not just flowers like women do. <SEP> For heaven's sake. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well um there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of. They're they're women. But um and usually they're the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon. And they do their thing. Uh-huh. <SEP> But um flowers are primarily the emphasis um whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more I do flowers sort of look pretty. Yes. I think so too. But I I really like to do the vegetables. Yes. And and I have spent the last ten ten years being a florist. <SEP> Being what? Being a florist. Oh my. Well what a wonderful thing. It was nice. It was exhilarating uh for many years. <SEP> Yes. Uh many of those tanned until the last couple when uh we had such an economic slowdown. Oh terrible. Yeah. Yeah. Well tell me what's in your garden this year since I don't have one. <SEP> Okay. Well uh the flowers I'm just. In fact I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in. I I always have geraniums. And um and then I have a shady area that I need to uh be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun. Uh-huh. So I've discovered that uh impatiens that tried and true is turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus. Because they uh look pretty and in my front garden uh. Uh-huh. <SEP> But I like the vinca which is something I hadn't. They look sort of like impatiens. You know but they're not quite. And they're better for the sun areas. Um and of course you know the mine are old theory ordinary flowers marigolds and and that sort of thing. Yes. In my. Do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds? <SEP> No. I don't. Maybe it's. I don't know. Maybe this climate is a little better. Yes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um but in the vegetable garden we grow um usually what. Our favorite is something called white half runner green beans. Now that's. Do you. Isn't that funny. So is my favorite. Well you know why because I grew up in North Carolina. Okay. <SEP> And that was my mother's um favorite bean. She alw- she always grows you know five different varieties. Yeah. But that's the kind that produces the best. Yeah. Well I think it has the best flavor. <SEP> And and they're wonderful. And I pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit. My mother picks them when they're fat. And she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs. Yes. Uh-huh. Well I like them in between. And they're good both ways. I like them in between. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. The flavor is better I think in between. Oh in between the. Size wise. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Uh-huh. My mother. Well my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them. Well and I know I love them. Well that's the yankee way. But I think that's like another vegetable. <SEP> Oh of course. I love them that way just just the thrill of. Yeah. It is. They're two different vegetables that way. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In fact I my mother who is eighty-six years old canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year. <SEP> Oh my gosh. My does mot- mother will be th- ninety this year. And she lives in western North Carolina. And uh she would do that if if we didn't tell her that she'd better not. Yes. Uh-huh. Yes. But she doesn't have that big a garden. But she has a bigger one than I do. Real-. Yes. <SEP> And I have four children you know. So. And she tends to it herself? Oh yes. Oh yes. Uh-huh. Isn't that wonderful. <SEP> Oh it is. It's great. It's it's really her joy. And I suppose that's why I enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it. I think so too. Yeah. <SEP> We also grow um yellow and green squash um much to my children's chagrin. Uh-huh. Right. <SEP> And uh we grow a lot of tomatoes uh. Uh-huh. There's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes. No. <SEP> So we enjoy that. Um we grow. I I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family. But I actually was successful for the last two years. So. Wonderful. I'm going to do it again. Bet you showed them. <SEP> That's right. And we grow broccoli. Oh. And I have been very uh happy about the new way of controlling the the uh worm that gets in broccoli um by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which is the uh little. Well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth. I don't know if you have had that problem there or not. No. <SEP> But it's you know it's a problem that's that's moving south from from the New England area. Yes. And they devastate the trees. So they they spray the government uh sprays um t- two three times in the spring when the uh caterpillars are are coming along because what they do this this uh bacillus um the worms ingest it. And it expands in their in their um digestive tract. And they die. Uh-huh. <SEP> So that's the same technique that is you know for any of the other uh little varmints that get in vegetables. So it. That's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of of handling the problem. Great. Well we could ch- we could really talk gardening a long time. I'm enjoying hearing you so much. Well it's nice hearing you talk. And I'm I wish you uh good luck. Have you just recently moved to Charlotte? Um a-. No. October. <SEP> Oh so well that's not very long. Uh so yes. Recently seven months. And it. Yes. The weather is wonderful. I love it. <SEP> Oh that's great. That's great. It is just terrific. You know rains a little too often. Well I hope you have a an opportunity to garden again. Oh I think so. I have a little spinach. <SEP> Oh well good. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
