Okay. Well I I I guess if I was having a dinner party I depending on the number of people I might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish. Uh-huh. And um I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a a potato dish. And we usually serve fresh fruit and uh then make a dessert. <SEP> Oh that sounds good. So that makes. Uh we're not uh real wealthy at the moment. Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna. And I used my mother's recipe. I really like it. It's got um. You cook the noodles and make and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it. And I'm not sure she even puts. Must be some Italian spices in there. I can't remember. But um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and uh layer all that. Well that sounds good. <SEP> It's good. That sounds good. And then uh uh tossed salad and and um Oh. My goodness Diane get down from there. And uh let's see. What else did I serve with that. Bread do you have bread to go with it? <SEP> Corn. Yeah. I made French bread with that one too. Gosh. I have a recipe that's pretty good for that. So. Oh well lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds. <SEP> Yeah. I've heard you know I've heard a lot of people say it the short cut on the cooking for lasagna. They they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna. I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna. So. <SEP> In fact I think I had it at a at a party once. Did you? It was good. Well I I know people that have have served it. And they say gosh if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy. <SEP> Easy. And she said it's they said it's good. Yeah. So that that's always sounds good to me um. <SEP> Yeah. I feel like I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot. Oh I know. I cook guess I cook a seems like I cook a lot of dinners oh not always for company just for just for family. <SEP> Oh yeah. So feels like I'm often in the kitchen. Not my favorite place but. A necessity. But a time consuming place. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Right. So. Let's see. What else do we like to have for. Trying to think what else I like to serve. My mother likes to serve taco grandes. Have you ever had that? I don't know. <SEP> What that is. No. I don't know what that is. You take a flour tortilla. And you fry it like a taco shell. Okay. <SEP> Right. And you uh. For all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um tomato sauce in it. And and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor. So you don't have to mess with spices and stuff. Right. <SEP> And then um let's see. And then and you heat up refried beans. And you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese. And what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first. Then you put the meat. Then you put the grated cheese. And then you put um. Let's see what's next. Then and I I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the um lettuce. Right. And you can put uh like guacamole and. Katy I'm on the phone. Well get a towel or go change. I'm on the phone. Um oh a little sour cream is good and and chopped olives. Right. <SEP> Right. Do you like to make your own guacamole? Uh yeah. Yeah. We we don't make it very often I guess. But uh. <SEP> No. I don't very often. Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain. Oh do they? So. Yeah. Gosh. <SEP> I just cut slices off. And. I like an avocado sandwich too. Gosh. Oh that's good. That's good. Or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Oh well we made I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day. And and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad. What you want. Wh- where do they get it? Well I don't know. I guess they don't have it at home. <SEP> I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to. I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe. They must they just said they never had it at home. So I I was concerned that I thought oh taking this you know taking this as a dip I thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly. Yeah. So I just. <SEP> It helps if you I helps if you leave the pit in it. Oh does that help? Yeah. If you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it. Okay. Well. <SEP> That's supposed to help keep the um keep it from turning brown so quick. Well I'll have to remember that. Well I just I that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top. And it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would. Oh. So. <SEP> Oh that's good. I thought maybe that was the trick. That probably helps too. Yeah. Yeah. So. Oh well. I guess we bought a lot of. We've been buying turkey lately instead of beef. So. <SEP> Do you want it? Even though you know. Oh yeah. We have too. The ground turkey it's the meat is softer. And I. Everybody seems to like it. <SEP> Do you want scrambled? So. Sometimes it seems to be cheaper too. So we often buy it. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. We buy it. If you get it on sale. Yeah. Yeah. So we bought that. Or we bought the the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets. And I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Or in. <SEP> I don't think mine know either. In fact we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey too. It costs less than the other. I don't know. There's supposed to be something more healthy about it. Yeah. Yeah. Poultry instead of the beef and pork. Less cho- less cholesterol. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Right. Right. Well I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight. Yeah. I I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve. Um. I always like dessert. <SEP> One salad that we always like my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a. I don't know what you call it. Uh you mix um cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of uh like Cool Whip. Right. Right. That's good and quick and easy. That's always good. <SEP> Probably probably the only family recipe that we we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake. And we take a recipe from my grandmother you know. Uh-huh. It's probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a.
