Okay uh. Well do you uh keep a family budget. Or do you have some. No. I don't use a family budget. My father who is very old has kept one his entire life. Uh-huh. <SEP> And I probably re- rebelled against it. I probably should have kept one. He keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage. Oh interesting. <SEP> Yes. Well uh we sort of started doing it years and years ago. And my husband started graduate school when we were first married. And I sort of just got in the habit I guess. And you know never have gotten out of it. I can not really say that it's a formal budget. It's more just a a pretty uh a fairly uh accurate uh recording of what I spend and what I think I am going to have to spend. Right. And uh. <SEP> I think it makes much more sense. Yeah. And I have recently uh gotten out of debt and everything. And I will probably ke- start keeping a little better track of it. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. I just uh spent whatever came in and and uh didn- never knew what came in and what went out. But uh just you know like about like the government runs. Right. <SEP> Yeah. Huh. That sounds real similar. <SEP> So I think it is probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record. But my dad was so precise that I mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent. Um. And that was put over there. Oh my. Yeah. <SEP> And I mean of course he is from the depression. And uh so uh you know it's his life. Yeah. Sure. <SEP> But uh I would I think it would be smart if somebody would keep uh some sort of a plan that works for them. Yeah. I think you are right um uh. Well i- it must have been sort of interesting to us. Is to uh it's because since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years I guess I can go back and look. And it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years. Uh. Yeah. It is. For instance. <SEP> I'm a historian. And my father had kept them I think since nineteen twenty-seven. And uh but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-. My goodness. I could not believe he did that. But then so I took the ones from fifty-two on to the present. Oh dear. <SEP> Yes. But to look to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that. Oh yes. <SEP> But uh. Well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things not lon- not long ago I guess it has been a couple of years ago in an old trunk that she had. And she came upon a a budget book that she had back in the thirties. Uh when they. Uh-huh. It was the late well. I guess it would have been I will take that back it must have been in the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time. And it was just uh fascinating to see how little things cost. I mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know. <SEP> Oh. Of course it's all relative of course. I know. Right. But uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know. For a pr- pair of shoes was like five dollars. And. <SEP> I know. Well even in nineteen sixty-three. I found a record that I had uh I travel in Europe a lot and I what I had paid for hotels. Um. And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now. Oh. <SEP> And I paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty. Oh isn't that something. <SEP> And that's really crazy. Cause that's about thirty years ago. Really. Oh that is that is really really something. Oh. But of course it's just what the market will bear. That's true. <SEP> If people will pay two hundred then why charge ten. Yeah. You know. That's that's right. That's exa- that's just good old economics working. <SEP> Right. Right. Well uh we have tried to uh instill some some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids. But our two children are just uh as um unlike as night and day. And our son could care less about a budget. Uh-huh. And our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost she almost just sounds like your father. <SEP> I mean she has everything planned so closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop. Uh-huh. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. Well then you never know how they will. One. They may flip flop when they get to be uh ol- we- older. Yes. <SEP> Right. Yes. The other one may be very careful. Yes. <SEP> And she may marry somebody. And of course it would be good because it you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching uh. Yeah. You should have one in the in the in the house. I think that is true. I uh. And I think that is probably what happened in our house. <SEP> And I think. Because I think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married. And I was I was really diligent about that. I was putting money aside and when before I was married you know when I was working out of college. And uh that really paid off. Yeah. Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts. And. <SEP> Yeah. That's about the way it is here. Yeah. If it had not been for my wife I would have probably been in debtor's prison if we had one. <SEP> So but what does you husband do now? Uh he is an engineer. He is uh an electrical engineer. And in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his P H D. <SEP> Oh. So we had a lot of lot of years of budgeting. Um. <SEP> Oh yeah. You have to do it when you are in school. And you know. Yeah. <SEP> When you. My wife is still in school getting her doctorate. Uh yes. <SEP> And it uh. Well I'm working I'm working on my master's degree now. And I have got. So in fact this last year we had three. Both of the children were in college. Our son has a year left. And our daughter graduated this year. And I'm just about ready to finish my master's degree. <SEP> Um. So we have had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us. Oh I I know. We had three in college plus my wife. But uh. <SEP> So that was four. Yeah. So we were both in the same. Yeah. Yeah. You know exactly what it what it's like then. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. And it's uh. Which you learn. I guess you figure that that is an investment that is uh really a in- invaluable. <SEP> That is the best one. Uh-huh. Yeah. With education you can't take that away from you. Yeah. <SEP> That is right. So it's it's one that you can live through. And I think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel. You know that that it was worth it to save and to not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it. Right. <SEP> Sure. So uh it really makes it easier. Yeah. That's true. But uh well I have enjoyed talking with you Jerry. <SEP> I have enjoyed talking with you Kathy. And I I wish I could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me. I am interested in that. Well if I had your address I would send you. I am also in the travel business. I do tours. Oh. <SEP> And I can take some real great tours to Europe. So uh if you. Oh wow. Well my my husband and I just went there last year. Um actually we did not take a tour. We we were in England and and uh went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and did it on our own. <SEP> Yeah. But uh um I. That sounds interesting. Is your business in Dallas then? Yeah. It's here in Dallas. Okay. <SEP> In the Quorum. So I I'm Jerry Hammond. And I'm out at Brookhaven College. So you could just holler at me there. Oh you are kidding. Yeah. Well I'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall. <SEP> All right. What is your last name? Kuenzer K U E N Z E R. And I'm. K U E N. Uh-huh. Z E R. And I will be in the communications department teaching uh English One Oh One to. <SEP> Well good. I will. I have a couple of sections. Oh well I know Zack Miller real well. Yes. Yeah. That's the guy who hired me. Yes. <SEP> Well wonderful. I will look you up in the fall then. Fantastic. Okay. Well it's been good ta- it's been a good type conversation. <SEP> Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
