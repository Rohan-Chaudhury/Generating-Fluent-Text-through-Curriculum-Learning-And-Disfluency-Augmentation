Okay. Do you have any pets? Yeah. I have three cats and a dog. Oh boy. Sound like us. We have. <SEP> Um. Go ahead. Um we just got the the dog less than a year ago. So he's still a puppy. Oh what kind is it? <SEP> He's a mixed breed. He's part Collie part Shepherd and part Chow. More Collie and Shepherd than Chow. Oh so you. The only Chow he's got is is his tongue. Oh he's got a blue tongue? <SEP> Yeah. Oh. He's got little spots on them. We have two Chows and a miniature Schnauzer and recently added a guinea pig which wasn't by my choice. But I was out ruled. So but the dogs are mainly mine and my husb-. But I just love them to death. <SEP> Was the guinea pig for your for your child? Daughter. Yes. Yes. As if the dogs weren't enough had to have a guinea pig. So anyway she's she enjoys her though. So that's that's what matters. But um our Chows we've had them I'd say right around six maybe seven years. And. <SEP> Really? They're um registered. And we've been breeding them. She's had about four or five litters. Oh my my husband's always wanted a Chow. But I'm kind of concerned about um with having cats and how how they socialize with cats. Um which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed. Oh. <SEP> Right. Um because we thought they would socialize easier. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um my husband had originally wanted an. And his brother has an. And he so far he's bitten ten people. Oh man. So. Goodness. <SEP> And the people that he got the from used to have cats. And they no longer have any other cats. So. It's telling um you know. When we had um we had a cat when we first married no took. Yeah. We had the cat first. And then we got uh the Chow. And bring um bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and and paw at their face. And they'd just play. And they were never they never harmed her. So uh they got along great. Now I don't know how how it would be bringing in uh like cat to a full full grown dog. Yeah. I wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog. Yeah. <SEP> But I I wouldn't feel um hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats. Right. I think they would socialize easier. I think so too. <SEP> Um how how old is your child? Five. Five? She's a real. <SEP> So you had the dogs before you had the baby? Right. And I was not really concerned about um them harming her uh. I think I think a lot of that that that we hear all the time is how you bring them up. Uh-huh. And ours are real friendly. They're protective. But they're very friendly and lovable. <SEP> Uh-huh. I mean you think they're lapdogs. You know. They'll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and everything. And. What color are they? Uh the female's red. And the male is black. <SEP> Oh I bet the black one's pretty. Yeah. He is he's a big old thing. And um I was concerned about the female mainly. And as luck had it uh she had puppies the same week my daughter was born. So it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about you know. About your baby. Yeah. And that. Yeah. I think that really helped and um my daughter you know since since she's little has been playing with them. And they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever. And she's she's grown up with them and loves them to death. And they love her. So. <SEP> Yeah. I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets as as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything. I do too. Yeah. <SEP> But I think it really helps them to understand when when they go to other people's houses. And they have pets. I see so many times kids just you know. They mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings. Yeah exactly. That or or uh the other extreme. They're they're terrified of them. And I hate that. Yeah. Yeah. And they shouldn't be. I mean some maybe. But but um like our miniature Schnauzer she's just she's just like um a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly. And a lot of kids are scared of that. And which I understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything. But when she calms down they're so scared of her. It's. <SEP> Huh. It that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing. She wouldn't hi- you know harm them at all. And and and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children. So I think I think it's a good idea to have them. We've had um in the past we've had birds too uh like Cockatoos. And parrots and The big white birds with the the orange crest on top. Uh-huh. <SEP> Now ar-. The the Cockatoos are those the big ones? Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. We've had those. And those are neat. They're messy very messy yeah and loud. Are they? Oh a lot louder than a dog you know. A dog you can tell stop barking you know or whatever. <SEP> Yeah. But the birds you it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever. But but they were neat enjoyable animals to have. Well we've thought about getting an aquarium partly be- partly for the cats. Uh-huh. <SEP> I think the cats would really enjoy it um. Yeah. With a lid. Yeah. Yeah. Of course um. But so far we just. And starting up an aqu- an aquarium. We we're thinking about getting a saltwater. Oh yeah. They. <SEP> And they're so expensive to start up. Yes. Yes. They are. And in your the luck of keeping them alive through those first you know few days. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. The the saltwater fish have so much more color. And they're so much more beautiful. I know they are. <SEP> Um the freshwater tank's just. Really to me they'll there's. Most of them really aren't that pretty. No. You know I really do- I really don't care much for them. Right. I don't blame you there. I think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than. I don't know. Those fish are just beautiful. Just so. Like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Rather than just little fish. But I don't mind having. Wren. My daughter had a like a little goldfish a about a year or two ago. Uh-huh. And it finally died. And that was neat. But the- and they're you know. She can't play with it. You can just look at it. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. You know you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat. And. Yeah. I wouldn't I wouldn't dare have a a goldfish here because it would probably be in a small bowl. <SEP> And then my cats would knock it over. Yeah. I have to be real careful about where I put things. Uh-huh. <SEP> If the cats will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time. Oh no. Oh no. They're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be. Yes. Yeah. And that's hard. <SEP> That's just like kids you know. Yo- they know that they're not supposed to do it. But they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to. That's right. And they're so independent. I love having them for that reason. Yeah. Yeah. And until we got the dog um it was real easy to to go to town for three d- three day weekend or whatever. Sure. <SEP> And now it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. <SEP> That's right. That is hard. And I. We knew it. But we never even thought that about when we got the dog. We just saw him oh. He's so cute. Oh. <SEP> Let's take him home. Yes. You know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment. Uh-huh. <SEP> And my husband went out of town and left me with with the brand new puppy. Oh fun. And I had to work twelve hours that day. Oh no. <SEP> And so I left the dog locked in the bedroom. And I put paper all over the floor. Well when I came home I opened the door. And there were chunks of carpet padding everything all over the place. Oh. Oh no. <SEP> And he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door. Oh no. I guess you didn't get your deposit back did you? Well I had the carpet fixed. Oh good. <SEP> Um I yeah I didn't even tell the apartment manager who got it. Oh okay. Oh no. Bless your heart. <SEP> But that that was my first real experience with with a puppy. When when we had our family dog growing up I was eleven or twelve I think when we first got him. Uh-huh. And I wasn't really involved in the the paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff. Sure. Yeah. <SEP> So this was and to me a whole new experience. Yes. It is. Only it wasn't like cats at all. No. No. I wish it was. I wish they were in that instinct. But they don't. <SEP> So. Our only problem with our Schnauzer she's an indoor dog most of the time. Uh-huh. And uh we found she's right at a year. And we finally got her you know house trained and everything uh. Her only problem is trash. If you do not pick the trash up you know the container and put it on a table or chair or something she'll knock it over. <SEP> Uh-huh. I don't care how fu- full she is. So it's not like she's hungry. It's just she wants to get into trouble. My cats do that it. If I through anything away that's any kind of meat or anything like that. Uh-huh. <SEP> Anything that that they think is good. They'll get into the trash. Yeah. And then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it. Yeah. <SEP> And how how tight you have the lid down on it. They'll get into it. I've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor. Oh I hate that. <SEP> And the cat's just looking at me like sorry. Yeah. You shouldn't have left it there. I couldn't help myself. I just hate that when she does that. I just oh. And she knows it's wrong. You'll walk in the door. And she'll cower and go hide under the table. <SEP> Uh-huh. So you she knows she does wrong. But she uh she continues to do it. So. Yeah. The problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not. He's actually not really a puppy anymore. He's like sixteen months old. Uh-huh. <SEP> Um but he's still chewing. Oh is he? Um the last thing he chewed up was uh when we.
