Okay um. Do you have any pets now? Well we don't right now. No. We've uh. I grew up with uh with pets. <SEP> My folks and I always had a dog and a cat some birds. Yeah. <SEP> But uh right now we don't have anything. Oh okay. Um that. What about you? A matter of choice or compulsion? <SEP> Well we've just uh. It seems like we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something. And uh it was never convenient to have anything. Yeah. <SEP> We were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house. Yeah. Uh someplace where there you know. We can take care of it and everything. We've got some children who would just really uh enjoy having an animal you know a dog I think. Yeah. <SEP> And What about you all? Yeah. Well right now I'm a student. And campus housing does not even allow thinking about that. <SEP> Oh no. No. We almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat. Is that right? Yeah. They're very strict about it. <SEP> But you like uh you like pets and things? Oh I love animals. Oh yeah. I was raised. Our house when I when I was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house. <SEP> Uh-huh. It was al- almost always at least one cat sometimes you know like fifteen or twenty. But uh always cats in the house. Oh yeah. We we enjoyed them. Oh. <SEP> We like we like pets. But uh you know you've got to deal with uh taking care of them and and feeding them and everything like that. Yeah. And our kids are. We've got some children. And they're not not used to it you know on a daily basis. They they uh. How old are your kids? <SEP> Oh from fourteen down to seven. Okay. You sound like you've got some small ones in the background. One. <SEP> Is that right? Our first. He's about te- eleven weeks now. Oh great. Yeah. <SEP> Congratulations. Yeah. Where are you from? Uh originally? <SEP> Uh-huh. West Virginia. Okay. Um I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country. But. <SEP> I've been to Charleston. Charleston West Virginia? Yes. Uh-huh. Okay. That's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway? <SEP> Uh-huh. Okay. In the north end of the state you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania. Uh-huh. Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown. <SEP> Uh-huh. Well that's yeah that's interesting. So it's really up north in the country really. Yeah. <SEP> I guess so. Yeah. It's. Well um my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far. Gosh. <SEP> I see. So. It's pretty nice country up there? Oh it's beautiful. <SEP> Hills or what? Uh well from my neck of the woods it's hilly. Uh-huh. Um you know uh maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation uh type variations from the valleys up to the hills the hilltops. <SEP> Uh-huh. Is it farmland? Um not a lot of farmland there. Mostly it's uh. I mean you know there's you know individuals with their own own f- uh growing their own food. Uh most of the agriculture it's more in the way of uh sheep and cattle. <SEP> Oh yes. And even that's you know small time mostly. Sure. Uh the biggest chunk of what's going on there is is uh industry. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants. Okay. Uh aluminum plants. There's like two aluminum plants. <SEP> What are you what are you studying there at Heidelberg? Computer engineering. Oh yeah. What year? Uh just finished up my fourth semester. <SEP> Well great. Yeah. Yeah. I hope that works out well. Yeah. It's a big change. <SEP> Yeah. I spent twenty years as a mechanic. What's. So. <SEP> Oh did you? Yeah. Well you've got some experience behind you in the work force. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Are you uh shooting for a bachelor's now or a master's or what? I'm working on a bachelor's degree. Oh okay. Good. I'm working on a bachelor's degree. It'll be compu-. <SEP> Hope it's a good program there. Pardon? Hope it's a good program there. Uh it seems to me from what I've been able to find out. <SEP> Yeah. Good. That's considered a pretty good program. It's nice and small which means you know if you don't get the class this semester then you've got to wait or three or four s- you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again. Huh. But uh i- it's worth it once you get it. <SEP> Well yes. That's good. And probably a good uh student teacher ratio and things. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Most the class are pretty small. <SEP> Good. That works out real well. Well I I was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment. Or a house somewhere what would you get? Uh well um first off we'd probably wind up with a a cat or maybe a puppy. <SEP> Uh-huh. I I I'm partial towards the larger dogs. Uh-huh. Um our last we've we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh had a hamster or two. And they they got to be a lot of fun. A hamster. <SEP> Oh yeah. Uh it's amazing how much character.
