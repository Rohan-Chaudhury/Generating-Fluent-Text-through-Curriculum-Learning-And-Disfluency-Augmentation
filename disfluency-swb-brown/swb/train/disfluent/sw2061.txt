Hello. Hello. Hey how you doing? <SEP> Not bad. Not bad. What's your name? Fernando. Fernando. My name is Nick. Wait. Let me turn off my stereo here. <SEP> Sure. Because I've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody. Really? Yeah. <SEP> Phew. Man I'm. Yeah. What time is it over th-. Are you are you in Dallas? No. No. I'm in Detroit. Or not Detroit. I'm in uh California. Are you? <SEP> Yeah. I. Because every time I got through I went to Dallas Texas. Really? Yeah. I'm in North Carolina. <SEP> Oh. Well you're on the uh. Let's see. On the other coast. Yeah. Twenty-one. Yeah. Shoot man it's what midnight almost? What? Yeah. Yeah. It's uh. I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here. <SEP> Yeah. Okay. All right. Well I guess we're supposed to talk. What about. Credit card? W- wait. Wh- what did how how did you get to know about the T I thing? Oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this. And. Wha- what are you working on? <SEP> A a Masters in uh information systems. Really. I'm doing my Masters in in computer science and computer engineering. Yeah? Where at? At North Carolina State University. <SEP> Hey. How do you like it out there? Uh I don't. Because uh I come from a lot a bigger city than this one. And I I'm in Raleigh. Yeah. And. <SEP> Oh. Raleigh Durham. Yeah. Yeah. That area. And it's really small. All all you have is like towns built around universities. Uh-huh. Like Chapel Hill? <SEP> Yeah. So it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway. Kind of quaint little towns. But they don't have a whole lot there. Yeah. Where you at? <SEP> Uh well I'm in Monterey California right now. Yeah. Oh okay. So so I mean it's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people. And that's about it. Two hundred fifty? Yeah. <SEP> Okay. It it's it's a lot bigger than Monterey is. But we're just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco. Oh okay. And it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city. So so where do you go? Do you go to Berkeley? <SEP> No. No. I go to the it's the naval postgraduate school out here. Oh okay. Because uh I was looking at at the doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they're asking like for a uh G P A of like three point seven or something like that. Uh-huh. And like they're looking like for uh G R E like ninety-nine percentile and this and that. <SEP> Yeah. And it's like. Well that's what they look for. Whether or not they get it is hard to say. Yeah. I know. That's why that's why I didn't apply. I mean it was like for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety-nine percentile on the on the verbal part. <SEP> Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. It's pretty tough. It's pretty tough. I. Uh let's face it you know. And you know I you know did the you know. As far as. I found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know. It's what you do. You know. Yeah. So uh I don't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that. So are are you going to go for your Doctorate? <SEP> Probably not. See I'm in the Navy. Yeah. And uh you know most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I. If I do do it it will be after I get out of the Navy. When do you get out? <SEP> Oh probably be another twelve years. Oh okay. Oh you know I like what I'm doing right now. But uh but what if they pay for it? <SEP> Excuse me? What if they pay for? If they pay for a P H D? Yeah. <SEP> Nah. They won't pay for it. They've I think they have maybe two people a year go get get their P H D. Because I know I know a couple of people here that work for uh the Army. Uh. Yeah. They civilians or uh military? I think I think they're military. But I mean the guy is still in. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And uh h- uh he works over in Maryland. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so he's doing his Masters here. They gave him like a scholarship like for a year. Yeah. And he's doing it in like in a year and a summer. <SEP> Uh-huh. And so he's getting that. And uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that. Yeah. That's why you want to join. <SEP> Uh-huh. But uh this guy. I mean you can earn a lot more money. So you say. I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your your your Masters. Uh-huh. They go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it. So. <SEP> Well a lot of times it's you know a lot of times it's not the money that keeps pe- that keeps people in. Yeah. They they like what they're doing. They you know they feel good about what they're doing. That type of thing. It's more. But I mean I mean you. The. Once you get your Masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty-seven forty-five thousand a year. <SEP> Uh-huh. And and that's not what they're paying. Oh easily. I'm sure. <SEP> No. Well it depends on what rank you are of course. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I mean like I say if you're if you're you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year. Yeah. But that's uh. <SEP> Yeah. Those are few and far between though. Yeah. It's like it's like uh in I B M. In I B M you can get certain points. <SEP> Uh-huh. And uh everyone's a manager. But nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money. Yeah. Since I imagine it's fairly competitive. Yeah. It's like. No. I I mean I B M is like. There's a joke about I B M which says you know it's like uh. All all the major companies get into a a boating race right? <SEP> Uh-huh. And so I B M says well we have we have to have a team right. Uh-huh. And then they come in last. And they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it. <SEP> Yeah. Saying. He goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right. So he goes have you come up with a -lution uh have you come up with a solution? They go yeah. Change the rower. You know it's like everyone's a manager. <SEP> But you know it's like only use like one person does the work. Yeah. So. <SEP> Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Yeah. So. Yeah. I don't know. That can be that that can really slow you down. Yeah. Well that's the way it works. I mean that's that's why they're having problems. I mean everyone's a manager. And. <SEP> I didn't realize that. Yeah. I mean it's like it's like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few. Uh-huh. And then the other people just plan it you know. It's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank? You know. <SEP> Push paper around. Uh-huh. Like all these people are just standing sitting around just going you know like what shall we do? Has anybody thought of anything? <SEP> No. And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along. They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world. And they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time. Uh-huh. And so it's like the same thing with I B M. You know. So they have this think tank. And they got to come up with ideas. But see uh the the thing is that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff. <SEP> Yeah. Oh yeah. They've got a they've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market. Yeah. And a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know. People generally go with that because they figure that the you know you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material. Whereas if you try something different they'll they'll say yeah. And it fails. And you're dead. <SEP> Why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline. Yeah. Well I B M doesn't fire anybody. Because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job. Which y- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything. No. <SEP> Uh-huh. So you quit. Uh. I mean that's their policy. They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally. <SEP> Illegal or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that. Uh-huh. But they won't let you off. What they'll do is like. Suppose you know like you're a manager. So they'll put you into keeping up the paper you know. <SEP> Uh-huh. It's like how much paper is going in? And then you say that's not my job. Uh-huh. So you quit. <SEP> So in other words that's the way they force people out. Right. That's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy. Right. <SEP> But it does- they don't really say that you know. You're you're always going to have great career conditions. Right. He- hey that's kind of sad. No. But I mean it's like it's like they they have just like different policy. I don't know. My dad works for them. But it's like I B M like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know. It's like they won't say. <SEP> No. Well they're the standard right now. Or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of I B M a lot of times. And the main. Yeah. Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy. <SEP> And anybody can fix it. Uh-huh. And so that's what you're going to go for. <SEP> Yeah. Well you know that's that's a that's a big thing. And and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge. Have you ever heard of Leading Edge? Yeah. They are out of Korea right. What? <SEP> Leading Edge. Don't they pro-. They they made like uh small personal computers. Yeah. Small P C -s. They're out of Korea right? I don't know. I don't know. But what they do is what they did I don't know is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away. And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away. <SEP> Uh-huh. Oh yeah. Yeah. <SEP> For example you test a chip. It can't last seven years. But it can last five. I B M says let's throw it away. Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you. Okay. And so that's. I mean they're still around I think. <SEP> Yeah. I've seen well I've seen them around anyway. You know. So that's what they do. They buy all all the things that I B M throws away. And they and that's why they're so compatible. Because I mean. Uh-huh. And by the time you have computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway. You know. <SEP> Most people do. Or they have to anyway. Well I mean there's like well. In a way you realize. I mean one t- one of my teachers got this computer which you know. It's like uh voice uh synthesizing stuff. Uh-huh. And he got that. He said you know it's like uh. I was testing it. And it was wonderful. And then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory. <SEP> Wow. And I want more you know. And it's like Jesus Christ you know. It's like why do you want more. Because it's like one second of recording. I mean you put into Wave. Uh-huh. And you want to correct the errors into Wave. It takes so much. I mean it's like. Of course it does. I mean by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model. And you put it in there. And you want to correct those. And then you know you're trying to make the the Wave smooth. So you can approximately. Of course it's going to take a lot. Imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know. <SEP> It's amazing. Yeah. It's like Jesus Christ. Well when you get you know when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like I say the more the more memory they're going to require. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. Both both in terms in Ram as well as uh you know standard memory or disk mem- disk base. Yeah. So. Well like they say like nobody can get enough you know. It's like once you have something. And it's like. <SEP> Oh yeah. You find out more. I was watching this program on T V yesterday. In nineteen seventy-six NASA came up with Three D graphics. Yeah. Right. <SEP> Uh-huh. And they were showing this like Three D g- Three D graphics view of like. Like the deal? What? No. No. No. <SEP> Like a hologram? This is like this is like video game stuff. With just graphics on on a. Okay? <SEP> Okay. But the only thing was that it was just lines. Okay. Like if you.
