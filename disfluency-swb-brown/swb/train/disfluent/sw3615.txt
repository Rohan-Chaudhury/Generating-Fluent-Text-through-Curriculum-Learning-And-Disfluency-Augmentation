Do you have any children? Yeah. I have two two boys twelve and sixteen. Twelve and sixteen. <SEP> Uh-huh. How about you? Well I have three. And uh they're five and three and nineteen months. Oh. So we kind of got different ball game. But uh. <SEP> Right. What uh. Do you feel like you have any time to spend with them? <SEP> Well. They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents. That's true. <SEP> You actually of course spend less time with them when they get older. But it's of course still really important. Right. I have a kind of a fortunate situation I think right now with my sixteen year old. Um I work two nights a week at a. I'm a librarian. Oh uh-huh. <SEP> And I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library. They keep it open you know for kids to do their work. Right. And he um and then they the school district hires an aide you know to work for me. Sure. <SEP> Well my son is my aide. Oh well that's nice. So two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together. You're stuck together. <SEP> And there's usually not very much business. No. I mean some nights it's just real real quiet. So. I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part. <SEP> So we I have sort of a captive audience. So I really do spend probably more time with him than than most you know. Right. But uh of course I'm away from my other son those hours too. But his dad's at home pretty much that time. And so that kind of gives him uh time with his dad then. <SEP> Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Gives him a little bit of that individual time. <SEP> But but it is hard once they get that age. I mean their friends are the most important thing there is. Right. And they want to be able to spend uh. That's right. Well I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year. And every day that she's not at school uh she thinks we need to have someone over and play. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And that kind of. <SEP> Yeah. It's kind of hard. Yeah. It's hard. I think uh I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should. Yeah. I'm more worried about Oh. I didn't this done. I didn't get. The kitchen needs to be cleaned. <SEP> Uh-huh. This needs to be done. And and I need to re- remind myself to slow down. Uh-huh. And it'll still be there tomorrow. <SEP> Right. Yeah. That's true. But that's kind of hard to do you know. <SEP> Yes. It is hard to do. Right. Yeah. You don't see yourself getting. Well if you're kind of a person that likes things you know organized or neat. Uh-huh. <SEP> Or you know. Right. Then I think it it is hard. It's um. I think one of the nice things about holidays is that you know it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah with family. Slow down a little bit. <SEP> We have we often go to Illinois for Christmas. Oh uh-huh. And we're not this year. And it's just really nice because we can do you know the things you want to do. You can do uh more than than when you travel. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. That's right. This is the first year we're staying home too. And uh I think it's going to be real quiet. But uh that's an opportunity to get out the games. And. <SEP> Yeah. Right. See we usually do that. My my kids even have already gotten out um. My twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer. Right. Of co- of course. <SEP> But you know but every now and then I mean he's got a lot of those technic those hard kind. You know and he wants to be an engineer. So he still likes all that kind of building stuff. Oh yeah. And um we have the train. And we haven't had that Lego train together for years. And um so he sat down. And I told him I really wanted him to build the train. And we would put it under the tree and that I would keep it together. I wouldn't take it apart. Wouldn't take it apart after that. <SEP> Yeah. And every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree. That'd be kind of fun. And um so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on Friday. And um then his sixteen year old brother started helping too you know. <SEP> You know these are kind of things like during the normal rat race. Right. Right. Those kinds of things never happen. No. <SEP> But. No. In fact in I think if people would learn to turn off the T V -s. And. Uh-huh. Yeah. I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family. <SEP> Yes. Yeah. Which is. Usually people are not sitting in front of that. <SEP> Uh-huh. And there's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it you know they're totally turned off to everything else. The rest of. Yes. And you can't communicate while you're doing that right? No. That's right. Whereas uh I'm the type of person I could not sit well. I shouldn't say I could not. But be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Yeah. I don't watch very much of it at all e- to to the extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that yeah. Because they talk so much. Isn't that the. <SEP> They talk about T V shows. And I huh. You know how can you watch that you know. You're kind of like what are you talking about. And uh. It's the best show on. I don't know. You feel like you're a little bit out of it don't you. <SEP> They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's.
