Okay. What kind of puppy you got? Well uh I think she's mostly German Shepherd. Uh she was uh uh. A person lives across the street from me uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep. Uh. <SEP> Somebody somebody abandoned her. And she's only about oh si- between six and eight six to eight weeks old. Uh-huh. And uh uh I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though. Oh. <SEP> She's o- I mean she's that this young. And she's almost housebroken. Wow. I mean she actually asks to go out. That's great. <SEP> And uh yeah. I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality. I don't know. I can't imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog. So. Yeah. Well I I have a dog that God gave us too. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. She just appeared. Oh really. Yeah. My husband calls her street dog. But we've had her now for about three years. <SEP> Uh-huh. And I just. You get so attached to them. Oh yeah. I had a uh. Last year I had ano- I had another German Shepherd. Now this one was purebred. And uh he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door. But uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time. Uh-huh. <SEP> And uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and he actually got over it with y- seven hundred dollars in vet bills. Um. Wow. <SEP> Um but he had actually was able to get him over that. Uh-huh. And then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy. And uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing. And then he got hit by a Cadillac. Oh no. <SEP> So I couldn't believe it. That was that was really hard. Oh gee. And that was even harder for. I was on a business trip at the time. And the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street. Uh-huh. <SEP> So they just felt absolutely awful. Oh I bet. And I felt felt probably worse for them than than for me. Because oh gosh they the uh this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog pro- she I think she loved that dog more than I did. And uh. She was jus- really attached to it. Oh gosh. <SEP> But uh it's unfortunate. But now I've got another one. So. Yeah. Yeah. How long has it been since the first one? Uh see he it it was just over a year. Uh yeah. <SEP> Uh it was in March of last year. So uh yeah. It'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year. Yeah. Well I had I had a German Shepherd before this one. And when she died it just it just absolutely destroyed me. I mean I was just you know. Yeah. I couldn't even talk about it for months. And so I decided well that's it. I'm not going to do this anymore. <SEP> Right. And then God gave me this dog. So. My dad's like that. He uh he had a beagle that he loved. And uh when that beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog. There's no way. Uh-huh. <SEP> No. How and then uh the he the beagle died in I guess about October. And by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh I or I gue- Humane Society and got uh got another one a stray. Yeah. And she she turned out to be a great dog. And we had her for six years until she just passed away recently. And again dad went through the whole thing. But mom went an. Okay. Yeah. <SEP> Well you just do. Yeah. You can't help. I- it's like it's like a kid. <SEP> Yeah. It is. Well hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life. Yeah. Well when uh. My my doggie uh that we have now uh she's she's mostly Golden Retriever. Uh-huh. The vet called her uh a golden mix. <SEP> Yeah. Like who knows you know. Right. But she's uh she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color you know. <SEP> Oh. And uh and her nose is that pink you know. Uh-huh. She doesn't have a brown nose. And her ey- she's sort of unicolor you know eyes are the same color and everything. <SEP> Yeah. So. I named her Rosebud. And uh a friend of mine said th- she that she gre-. This friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had uh a pet cow named Rosebud. And she said there's a lot of longevity in that name. Said my cow lived seventeen years. <SEP> That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too. They're kind of like get that permanent smile to them. Yeah. Right. They're always always happy. I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy. And she's so easy going and so sociable. <SEP> Yeah. You know she loves everybody. And little kids can just you know maul all over her. Right. And she just you know thinks it's great. <SEP> This this friend of mine has th- well. It's the same guy that was watching uh my German Shepherd when he got hit. But uh went fishing with him on Friday and took. He's got a full a pure bred Golden Retriever. And then I had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy. And we went and took the two dogs up fishing. And this. They just they had a ball romping around. Uh-huh. And you know you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in. Getting in. Yeah. <SEP> And uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current. And uh. Oh no. Well no. Actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in. And I. He's he's just about a year old himself and never had really. I don't think he'd swum before. Really. <SEP> But he jumped in in the the river. Did puppy go to? Well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the. I was careful to keep her away from the the fast moving water. Oh that's good. Yeah. <SEP> 'cause if she fell in then I'd of been had to go in after her. And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now. Ugh. Ugh. <SEP> And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her. But uh this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up. And then he he jumped in again. And he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon. He loved it. Yeah. <SEP> Cocoa didn't think too much of it though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad. Yeah. <SEP> And so but uh she got over it. So. Well the German Shepherd that I had before. We we had a little pool. Uh-huh. And uh she was she did not want any part of swimming. But she liked to to get in the pool on the first step. She'd just get on the first step and lay down. You know in the summertime when it's really really hot. <SEP> Uh-huh. Yeah. And she'd just lay there on that step and just you know cool off. <SEP> Yeah. I've I live right across the street from a a big lake here um. It's on Oneida lake. And I'm wondering if uh if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. I mean I've got. The yard's all fenced in. So she doesn't run loose. But uh she could go in sometime when if I'm watching her. Uh-huh. So. Yeah. Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that. <SEP> Oh really. Yeah. And she. Oh baths. Oh gee she hated baths worse than anything. It was it was just really a fight to you know get her clean. Yeah. Have you seen uh CANINE. The movie oh. <SEP> No. No. You've got to see it. Especially since you have a German. It is so cute. Oh really. Yeah. And uh an part of the the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up. And it's it's just hysterical. <SEP> Oh okay. My my dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. And that was the thing I couldn't figure out. Because he would go in the lake. It wasn't like he didn't. Uh-huh. I-. Normally I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet. But if you wanted to get him wet forget it. Yeah. Well that's how Cleo w- you know. She'd lay on her step. <SEP> Yeah. But that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet. And she didn't want you getting her wet. Right. Right. Obstinate. Obstinate. Yeah. But you really need to see that movie. I I w- we bought the movie. And I don- I don't know how many times I've seen it. <SEP> Uh-huh. And it came on T V the other night. And I was watching it again. And my husband heard me laughing. And he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie. I'll have to check it out. I saw the the uh previews for it and all. And it did look like it'd be a good mo- movie. But. It is great. <SEP> Uh really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately. Yeah. But I got to do more more fun things. Well we always wait until we can rent them you know. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Well I'm uh I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force. And so I travel a lot. Oh really. And yeah. I'm a engineer at uh at the laboratory Rolm Laboratory Griffis Air Force Base up here. So. Oh. <SEP> That's how I got into uh into the switchboard project and all that. So. Uh-huh. But it's nice having a dog here uh. The. Oh yeah. There's just. <SEP> Un- un- uh. What's the unrequir- what's the word I'm looking for uh lots of affection no co- unconditional affection from the from the dog. Right. That's it. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. Really. Not critical at all. No. No. Yeah. They're really wonderful. <SEP> Yeah. Well it's been nice talking to you. We seem to be degenerating here. So.
