I uh spent four years as a university professor. Oh really? And. <SEP> Yeah. I I spent three years. I'm teaching in public schools and elementary school. Oh do you really? <SEP> Uh-huh. That's great. I taught in Utah. And uh Did you teach in California? No kidding. <SEP> W-. I did. <SEP> Uh-huh. I did uh. You sound pretty young for a university professor. Well I was pretty young. I was uh. I had never intended to do it. And I was uh uh given the opportunity after I'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system. <SEP> Uh-huh. At any rate uh the topic is fascinating because one of the things I've done for the past few years is uh research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically. Uh-huh. You may be familiar with cooperative learning. Have you ever. <SEP> Well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because I don't think we did that in Utah. Well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools. And uh what what it involves basically is the use of peer groups. And the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives I guess they're called. Uh-huh. And there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh gain a competence with respect to the material. <SEP> Uh-huh. Uh I think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn. Uh I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster. Uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators. Uh-huh. Yeah. And uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results. So my feeling is that uh the the problem is is uh significant. There are plenty of good people uh available to uh offer people educational experience. But that we just have to re- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it. And uh I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research uh uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning. <SEP> Uh-huh. And my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually. I don't know what form it will ultimately take. Uh uh but I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior. So it must be the way we're managing the process that uh. Yeah. I see what year saying. Yeah. I totally agree. I I don't I don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it a- both as quote unquote students and as teachers. But clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh. <SEP> Oh yeah. Uh-huh. You must see kids with real significant problems uh in some cases. Uh course I always see the. I don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City? Is it is it uh deteriorated a lot. Do the people say. Are they pretty happy with it. Or. <SEP> Well I I haven't taught in Iowa. But I've taught in Utah. And uh people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home. Or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids. Right. Even in Utah. <SEP> Yeah. Well Well uh maybe it was the area I was in. Well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe. But a lot of schools had a lot of transient uh families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side. And. Yeah. You so you saw a fair number of troubled kids. <SEP> Yeah. I mean like you said how they were the schools are doing more things for the kids they thought than they were thirty years ago. I mean they were the school I was teaching at the the year I left they were considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids. Yeah. Yeah. <SEP> As well as hot lunch. And.
