This is Archie. Hi Archie. I'm Sharon. Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES? <SEP> Yeah. I've seen that. That's uh that was a really good movie. Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery. And uh I thought the story was pretty good too. I I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it. Have you ever lived in that part of the country? No. I haven't. Have you ever visited it? <SEP> Um I've visited the Wyoming area. I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed. I think it was the black hills of South Dakota. Could be. I n- I haven't been to South Dakota. Have have you been up to that? Well I lived in Omaha for five winters. <SEP> Oh. Okay. And that rolling kind of uh. <SEP> Terrain. Yeah. Is is fairly famili-. The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics. Apparently it's going to win everything. Really? Uh and I had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of. <SEP> That's true. I agree with that. Um I I noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it. I think it's been nominated for twelve awards. And and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud. So it it has surprised everybody. Well the interesting thing was is I had heard that. And I I I tend to I think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great. And and it was the thing is it was it was a good story. <SEP> Uh-huh. Right. And and and I guess that's what I really like. Although I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour. <SEP> Did you? Yeah. Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY? No. I've heard I've heard that's really great though. <SEP> Y- you have to go see that one. And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB? No. Go. You must really keep up. <SEP> I do. I go every weekend. I I uh. Those are two definite must see movies I think. Well isn't isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY isn't that a. I- is it is it a terror movie. Or is it just suspenseful? It's suspenseful. I don't think it's very t-. I mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that. It's it's more suspense. Um the other one SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff. It's it's pretty graphic at points. But uh I think they're both excellent movies. Do you do you listen to Gary Cogill? <SEP> No. Huh-uh. Is uh. Do you know who he is? Yeah. Somebody in South Carolina told me about him. He's a the movie critic. Um oh you've oh. Okay. He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas. <SEP> Yeah. And he does uh he has a talk show on the K L I F. Anyway it's on from seven to nine or something. And and and people call in. And it's. If you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting. There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do. They've got uh they've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old. And they call in. And they review movies. But it's uh. Oh. He anyway he. It's interesting. You listen to him. And then you you go watch the movie. In fact they had people had just seen. I was listening Sunday night a little bit when I was going to pick up my daughter. <SEP> Uh-huh. But anyway it was uh the. It it's interesting though. The the difficulty with with DANCING WITH WOLVES is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good. Or did he just do it? I think that I think he really. His heart was in it. But I I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was. I think it was something that he really wanted to do. He wanted to direct it. He wanted to to star in it. You know he he enjoyed the story line. And I think he just really w- he really wanted it. And whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office I think he would have been happy. Because I think that I think he did a good job. And and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him. Do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver? <SEP> Um. A little piece of trivia. You know the guy when he first headed out from the army post. Yeah. Who. No. I don't know who that guy is. He he plays on MURPHY BROWN. <SEP> Oh he does? Yes. He's he's Eldon her housepainter. As a recurring character every week? <SEP> Oh. Can you believe that? No. <SEP> Now see I'd I'd a never put those two together. That's that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that? Huh-uh. I thought no it's really funny. But I thought it it. You think back. And yeah. It was him but with a you know with the beard and all that stuff. <SEP> Yeah. I mean it's uh. Yeah. Real scruffy looking. Yeah. Real scruffy looking. <SEP> And it wa- it was really funny it's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie. But I thought it's good that you know. It was a lot of fun. Yeah. I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go. But we're at about five minutes. I should think we've done enough. <SEP> You think so? I mean I haven't been watching my watch. Um I guess. Yeah. Does it usually cut off? Is that what it does? Well I don't know. Why do we end this thing? <SEP> It used to it used to just automatically cut off. I think it just says hang up. But it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up. So I I guess so. Why don't we do that? <SEP> Okay. Good-bye Sharon. Good talking to you Archie.
