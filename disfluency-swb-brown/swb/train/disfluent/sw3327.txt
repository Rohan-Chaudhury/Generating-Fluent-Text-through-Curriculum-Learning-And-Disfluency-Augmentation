Okay. Is it Mike? Yes. Do you repair your own car? <SEP> I try to whenever I can. I've always been a a I guess a product of a handyman father. Well I tell you what that's y- count your blessings because uh it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves. Th-. <SEP> Yeah. Yeah. There's. A- although I'll tell you you know over the years the cars get more complicated. Well that's why I don't do as much as I'd like. <SEP> Right. Yeah. Because they are I mean they've got they've gotten complicated haven't they? Yes. One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick. Which after awhile I could you know take it apart in my sleep if I needed to. Uh-huh. <SEP> Is that right? Yeah. It it got to be pretty straightforward to understand. And now since then you know the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick the the more I know about it. <SEP> And then start getting into these Nissans and the like. And I just can't keep up. Yeah. I I agree. About all I ever. I never was too mechanically inclined. But I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and. Yeah. Course they don't use uh points anymore. <SEP> That's right. But Uh they do still use plugs. Yeah. <SEP> Yeah. And uh now brakes I've always done a lot of you know changing brakes. Uh-huh. And I used to do I could always do the alternator you know and starter. <SEP> Yes. I don't anymore. But I have on a lot a lot of times. Yes. I understand. My last car repair actually had to do with brakes. And it's one I did not do myself. I took the car my. I have a seventy-nine El Dorado took it to be inspected. Uh-huh. <SEP> And the parking brake failed. So I got under there and messed with the the ten- that uh that adjustment to make to t- tighten it up. Uh-huh. And that didn't do the trick. Uh-huh. <SEP> And then I got there and tried to. It probably slipped loose didn't it? Well actually that wasn't even eventually the problem. I I did a lot of things that I I did everything that I could think to do. Uh-huh. <SEP> And eventually I brought it up to a a place called Just Brakes. Uh-huh. And it turns out that there's a. The parking brake i- in the rear. There's a there's disc brakes. And the parking brake is a piston deal. Um. <SEP> And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up. Oh. So they ended up having to pound it out. And one of them they were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it. <SEP> And the other one they just it was just frozen solid. So I ended up having to buy one. And altog- all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done. Y-. Well it really wasn't quite s- as bad as you thought was it was it? Y- yeah. Actually I I think it was a lot of money. But I I don't like I s-. Well it was a lot of money. But. <SEP> Yeah. But I. It got to the point where I didn't know what was going on. So. You had to have the help didn't you? That's right. That's right. Yeah. Well do you still do much work on them then? <SEP> I do. Th-. Act- th- actually that was just a at at the beginning of September. And whenever I can I do try. I. A- actually I'd say this. I I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because. Disposal is a problem. Well that is one problem. But also these uh these fast oil change places you just can't beat them. That's true. <SEP> For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do a f- you know as good a job as I can do but they'll uh lube too. That's true. Right. That that. I've I've quit doing that myself. <SEP> Yeah. And but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know. Yep. That's right. And uh but it. But no. I guess i-. That. And the main reason that it's it's quick.
