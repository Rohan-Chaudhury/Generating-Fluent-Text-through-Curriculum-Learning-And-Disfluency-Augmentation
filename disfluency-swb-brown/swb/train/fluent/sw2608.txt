. Do you want to go first? You can go first. Or I will. <SEP> You go ahead. I'm going to tell you what I'd have. Down in the south we have a lot of shrimp? <SEP> And I have shrimp that is steamed in beer that I cook. <SEP>. And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook garlic bread green salad tea. And we'd have a lemon pie for dessert. <SEP> It sounds fantastic. And what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your rice cooker. <SEP> And you place the shrimp in the rice steamer. And you put a bay leaf and put some red pepper over it. You can either use the kind that comes in the little can. Or you can just get some regular red peppers. <SEP> Is it cayenne pepper you mean? Cayenne? <SEP> And you put a little bit of that over it. If you use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them. And you put that in there. And then you pour two bottles of beer over it. <SEP> And how much shrimp would you use? Two pounds. Two pounds. That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells. <SEP> Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up. And you pour the beer over the top of it. And you cover it. <SEP> And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil and the shrimp turn pink. <SEP> Then you remove it. And you put it on a platter. And then you serve it with melted butter. And I usually put garlic powder in mine. And they can just dip it. And they shell it as they eat it. <SEP> But then the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave. And what you do is you just wash it. And you core it. And in a. Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave. <SEP>. <SEP> A glass dish. But it's got to have one that has a cover on it. <SEP> And you put about two tablespoons of water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt. And then you just set your cauliflower in there. <SEP> And then you cook it for seven minutes on high. And you rotate it one time. And are you cooking the whole head at one time? <SEP> When you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off. <SEP> I see. And you just set it in there. And you microwave it on high for seven minutes. And you turn it one time. And while that's cooking I take about a cup of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder. And I mix it all together. And I shred up some just regular white cheese. <SEP> And after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it. And then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that. And you cook it for another three minutes on high just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it. And it's done. <SEP> That sounds fantastic. It is good. <SEP> But it looks. What I usually do is I'll sit the cauliflower in the middle. And then I put the shrimp around the outside of it on my platter. <SEP> And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that. And you have all the different seasonings and stuff. And then I just fix little individual cups for them. And they have the garlic bread. And it makes it a real nice looking. <SEP> And it's not much work. But it looks like it. <SEP> That sounds. Real-. You look like you went to a whole bunch. <SEP> I bet it tastes good too. And usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it. And I'll lay those on top of my salad to make it look nice and things like that. <SEP> How many could you serve? It usually serves six. I figured about that. <SEP> That's good. Out here we have so many ethnic people. We have Italians. And we have Portuguese. And we have Russians and Polish. And it depends out here the type of people you're going to entertain? So it's hard. You just have to pick something for the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time. <SEP> And they're big on finger food here too. Chicken wings and ribs and that kind of stuff. Barbecue and cooking out in the yard when it's nice. Barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff. Have you ever had crawfish? <SEP> But I have had shrimp. You ought to try some crawfish. They are good. But that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over even if it's out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking. Of course. They want it from down here. <SEP> That's. Because just now especially crawfish it is starting to move out. And more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is. <SEP> But. Is it like shrimp? It's similar. <SEP> It's similar. It's not exactly. Ch-. It's got a taste of its own. But it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it. <SEP> It does? Does it look like a lobster? <SEP> It looks more like a crab. It looks more like a crab. <SEP> But. Are they thin long or wide? <SEP> I can't even think of what you. I guess it looks more like a cross between a crab and a lobster. Because it's small like that. And it's got the pinchers like a crab. But it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would. <SEP>. <SEP> And we call them mud bugs. But they're fantastic tasting. They are so good. Everybody. It's the season for them right now. <SEP> And where did you say you were from? Louisiana. Louisiana. Do you do cajun cooking? <SEP> I love blackened the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff. ! We have a few places up here that do that. <SEP> And if ever I see it on the menu I always get it. It is so good. You know. <SEP> How do they do the blackened? You buy it as a seasoning. But do you have to have a certain skillet or something? <SEP>. I cook mine do you have a black iron skillet? <SEP> I did have. I don't have it now. But I have mostly Teflon. I guess you could cook it in that too. You now. But. But I don't know. I never have. I use the black iron skillet to cook mine. <SEP> Does it have to get extremely hot? But it doesn't burn or anything like that. The blackening is really the seasoning. <SEP> It's a blackening seasoning. I see. <SEP> That is a seasoning. It's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it. <SEP> I see. Because what it's called is Blackening Magic. And it comes in a bottle. And I'm trying to see. It's got a picture of Dom De Luise on it. <SEP>. You would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time? <SEP> Is that what you're saying? Because I could have the chicken on the skewers with blackened seasoning. But. <SEP> And that is so good. Delicious. But you do have to have it hot when you cook it. Your pan. <SEP>. It does have to be really hot when you put it in. But it's not like it's burned. And what blackens it is the seasoning. <SEP> And it is so good. It is. I love it. <SEP> In fact I was in Texas for a little while. And I liked the barbecues and the Mexican food. <SEP> I have a passion for all that type of different tastes. Because I have been brought up mostly Italian American food. Because my parents are Italian and Portuguese. So we cook a lot of pasta and gravies and pizzas and roasts and that kind of thing. That's why I enjoy going to restaurants and trying different things. Have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana to visit? <SEP> I would love to. You ought to come down. I. You don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans if you want to really get some good food. <SEP> You don't have to go that far south. But of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as I'm concerned. <SEP> Is that right? And fact is we're going to take a vacation this year. We're going to go to New Orleans again. And we're only going down there for the food though. <SEP> Where do you go when you go there? right on Basin Street and those places? We go to the French Quarters and stuff like that. And I have some friends that live down there. And so usually we don't go to the tourist ones. <SEP> We go to the ones that they tell us to go to. I see. And we went to this one. It was called The Back Porch. And they were cooking the stuff while we went on this boat ride. And then we came back and ate out on this back porch. And usually if you can find somebody. <SEP> That's nice. Of course when you go down there they've got just. There's no where you can miss. I have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full. It's unreal. <SEP> It's so good. The seasoning it's just unreal. And don't they make a lot of. I'm trying to think what they call their soup. I don't know. Gumbo. <SEP> Jumbo. Gumbo. Gumbo. <SEP>. Is that with seafood? You can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood. <SEP> You can? That looks good too. I've seen the chefs on T V do that? <SEP> And it looks delicious. And I'll tell you what. We do a thing we call it a sea bake. You take clams.
