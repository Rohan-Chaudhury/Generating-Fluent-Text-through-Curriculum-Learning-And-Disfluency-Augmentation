. Go ahead. <SEP> What kind of car would I want to buy. I don't know. The question is would I want to buy. Or would I probably actually buy. May be two different things. If you had all the money in the world or something. <SEP> If I had all the money I wanted then that's whole different matter. In that case I don't know. My dream car for years was a Porsche Turbo. <SEP> But I don't know if I'd want one of those now. <SEP> Of course I would want one if somebody was given to me. But I maybe would buy a B M W. Or even a Volvo. <SEP> What do you have now? I've got a Dodge Daytona. <SEP> It's actually the first car we ever bought new. I have. My car is the first one we ever bought new too. But we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually. <SEP> Me too. What car do you drive? What is it? Mine is a Honda Accord. <SEP> We almost bought one of those. Do you like it? I do. And it's funny because after I bought it I was doing a lot of business traveling. And I. Some of the cars that I got were the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors. And I don't like them as well except it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics. And mine is a standard. <SEP> And the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better. It had a lot more pickup and everything. <SEP> You get a little more control over when it's doing the things it's doing. What rental agent did you go to to rent those kind of cars. <SEP> Usually AVIS. To what AVIS? AVIS. <SEP>. I guess. It's just because we're on. I think of it. I'm not sure those are AVIS or not. But we have corporate contracts with the various companies. <SEP> I see. So it depends on your destination too. <SEP> Kind of strange. You work for a big company then. Work for T I. Which is how I heard about this. <SEP> T I I see. But. I don't know. If I were to buy a car with the constraints of real money I probably would go with something like a Honda Accord. <SEP> Maybe it would. One thing I really liked about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have this seven year warranty. <SEP> And it really saved us some big money once. It did. They had a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time. <SEP> And the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars. And I had to pay twenty five for the. That was great. It was. That's unusual to hear. Usually something breaks. You look at the warranty. And it's excluded. <SEP> We bought the extension and at the time we bought it it was four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra. I see. You got your money's worth. <SEP> We did. But we really debated at the beginning. And of course I'm glad I did it. That is good. <SEP> But we still have three years left on it. I've been lucky. Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it. But I was real lucky because it just hit the lens to the light. <SEP> Bumper? It didn't actually dent the car or anything. So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that. <SEP> That was good. And the store will pay for it anyway. Are you. So. No big deal. <SEP> If you were going to buy a new car would you buy another Accord? I probably wouldn't just because I already have one. <SEP> But if I had to make the choice again I'm perfectly happy with what I decided although we did just buy another car. And that's a Legend. <SEP> Those are nice. But it's a used one. And my husband has really wanted one for a long time. And the fact that this car that I have has performed so well. And before that I also had an Accord. It was a real old one. <SEP> And I bought that used. I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that. And it served me real well too. So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars. <SEP> And. My sister drives one. She drives a is it Legend. <SEP> It's a. I'm not certain. But she's liked it. But I have never had. And we. In fact what I'm driving right now. We only had one car for a long time. And yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth four miles to work and back kind of thing. <SEP> <SEP> And so I bought a used Yugo just to be a little car that I could care less about. <SEP> How did it go for you? It's worked. Hasn't left you stranded. <SEP> That's exactly what it is. It's a cheap little car just to go run around town in. I know. <SEP> And. It's actually kind of fun to drive. I. Getting back in the Daytona now I almost don't like it. It's too mushy. And it's an automatic. <SEP> And. That's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the Legend. It's too. The steering. It's windy. <SEP> You feel like you're in a boat or something. It's kind of. I can't drive that. The Legend it's just so huge. I don't like it. And it's so.
