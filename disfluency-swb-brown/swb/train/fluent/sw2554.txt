What do you think about it? Most of the stuff up until now in the recent months I don't have any problem with. I don't either. <SEP> It's. It. I don't think it's going to change very much. But. I agree with that. As far as the mess that's developing as a result. As a country the United States. I think our hands are tied as far as any further involvement until the U N sanctions it. <SEP> In fact it really was to begin with. <SEP> And I heard a comment on the radio this morning that it gets to a point where if enough people are going to be slaughtered over there over the internal problems somebody may step in again. But I really think it's a U N issue at that point because it is internal. <SEP> The funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy. And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in Iraq they're going crazy. <SEP> That's right. That's right. You can't please them one way or the other. And I think that I agree with you. This is exactly the right course. That's an internal problem to Iraq. It has nothing to do with us. <SEP> And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved then it's nobody's business. That's right. <SEP> These types of internal things go on all over the world all the time. All the time. Some of them have been going on for tens of years if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and. <SEP> And it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years. And it's going to continue. <SEP> That's right. As long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time. That's absolutely right. The Kurds have tried it before. They've gotten their butts kicked. <SEP> And this is just another time that it's happening. That's absolutely right. They'll regroup out in the mountains. And they'll try it again in a couple of years. <SEP> It was. It's a very opportune moment for them to try. You. And I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. <SEP> But I'm not real sure that we promised them anything. I. That would have been stupid. <SEP> And I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that. I agree. But it really doesn't make any difference. This is just another chapter in Middle Eastern history. <SEP> And there are many of them. There's no doubt about it. The British occupied the place. The French occupied it. We've done it. It's happened so many times. This is really nothing special. And so many of the conflicts really don't have a basis in politics or human rights or anything like that. It's religious based. That's right. It's mostly religious anyway. <SEP> And by self-proclamation this is a holy war. And it is right. And then we go on from there. And. <SEP> It's a mess. It's. There's no doubt about it. And. I think one of the big problems. Looking at it from the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners. That's right. They don't understand what. Their politics really isn't politics. It's religion couched as politics. <SEP> And there's a big difference. We sit there. And we think that they think the way we think. <SEP> And that's a big mistake because they don't. You bet. <SEP> You bet. Because there's a complete different set of values. There's different value placed on human life possessions and everything else. <SEP> And what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases. That's it a lot of the time. I was stationed in Turkey for a year and a half. <SEP> And it was tough understanding those folks. <SEP> They're so completely different culturally and socially and religiously. It was very strange. <SEP> I believe it. It was very interesting. I can believe that. I don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means. But. I. I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't have a clue sometimes. <SEP> That's probably true. That's probably true. They sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert. I'm not real sure that's appropriate. <SEP> That's. A little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field. But. I sort. That sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too. <SEP> And we make experts by reading books. That's right. And the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing. <SEP>. I guess you work for T I. <SEP> That's right. So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else. That's an everyday occurrence. It's like our car industry. The only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese came into it and helped us out. <SEP>. <SEP> I agree. It's an overall problem in this country understanding foreign cultures or even accepting them. <SEP> And it bites us over and over. Again the. And until we start changing our educational system. We're we've already been overtaken. But it's going to get even worse later. Looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the math and the science and everything. <SEP> That's right. It's not us. That's right. We've got folks running around here who get degrees in basket weaving and underwater psychology or some ridiculous stuff like that. <SEP> <SEP> And where are the engineers coming from? They're coming from various places. And a lot of them are going back there. <SEP> That's. My roommate is a. He's getting his doctorate in industrial. It's not industrial engineering. It's human factors. His degree was in industrial engineering. <SEP> I see. And he's from the Philippines. And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it. <SEP> He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs. But I see it all too often. We've got loads of foreign students. <SEP> And they're coming here going after the hard degrees. And then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else. And they're applying it there. <SEP> That's right. And I don't know. To me it's amazing. I don't know what we're going to do as a country. We're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later. Every. The country's got a problem with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that. <SEP> And the long-range views are just kind of become a thing of the past. You. And. I don't think there can be anymore long range planning. I think it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike. <SEP> Here's a crisis. Let's plug it up. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. It's far beyond me. <SEP> That's for sure. That's the way things have gotten. All we can do is keep plugging. I wonder. I read in the paper just last week I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer. <SEP> At a price tag of six thousand bucks I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers. Be-. I have the I B M P S two. <SEP> But I'm sorry I got it. It's slow. There are many better machines on the market right now for a. <SEP> The only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school. <SEP> And I saved forty-eight percent. So I said if I can have an I B M for forty-eight percent discount I'll take it. <SEP> But up to that point I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name. That's right. But. <SEP> That's absolutely right. You watch. Just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it. <SEP> The. Unfortunately the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get something in your hands. It's already outdated. <SEP> It's obsolete. And we fight that battle every day here at work. I can imagine. <SEP> And. Years ago I remember when I had a T I ninety-nine. Put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other. And things just kept changing so much. And I kept getting rid of them. And I finally said you can't do this. <SEP> That's right. You've got to buy something and stick with it. So I just. That's right. At an opportune time I got one that suited my needs. And I've just stuck with it. The only thing I've done to it is just add a mouse and a hard drive. <SEP> And that's all I plan to do. Of course I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line. I got the model twenty-five. So I'm stuck with six forty. But I'm not a power user. So it doesn't matter. <SEP> That's the key whatever works for you. And if it does the job then that's what you need. My roomie on the other hand he is a power user. <SEP> He's looking now to get rid of his. He's got a three eighty-six and wants to get a four eighty-six. This kind of stuff.
