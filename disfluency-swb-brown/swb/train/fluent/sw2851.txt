. Quite a few. And they're varied. They don't encompass many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing. But I do quite a bit of wreath making. And my dogs are my hobbies. I do a lot of gardening. I go to estate sales which takes up a lot of time. <SEP> What do you mostly do? Mostly right now I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible. We're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff. <SEP>. That should be fun. <SEP> Fun for them. How old are they? I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three. I think that's better than having that party at home. <SEP> This is a friend's party. And they rented. Or they. The party. They just rent skates and stuff for the kids. So they're looking forward to it. And the skating rink does the rest practically I guess. <SEP> <SEP>. What a help that is. <SEP> So. What kind of. How long have you lived in North Carolina? Not that long. <SEP> Just since October. We moved here from Enid Oklahoma. So we're originally from Virginia this part of the country. <SEP> But we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid and loved it. <SEP> But we needed to get back to our older parents. <SEP> But I am loving it. The weather is divine. <SEP> Did you like Oklahoma while you were there? Very much. <SEP> What did you all do? My husband was with University of Oklahoma and Phillips University in Enid. <SEP> And then he went with a family corporation that has oil and ranching and varied enterprises. And he just quit a perfectly good job and came we came East. <SEP>. So is he working there then. Or. He's doing quite a bit of consulting work and has been offered a permanent position. <SEP> And he's contemplating. He's liking this free time actually. <SEP> It's just wonderful after all these years of working. <SEP> How did you get hooked up with the T I switchboard thing? A gal who works with T I on this project. I think she's a temporary worker. Mother is my best friend in Virginia. <SEP> I see. So we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country. I see. <SEP> W-. My wife has talked more than I have. She's talked to four five different people. It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas. In fact she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina I think. What is her name? <SEP> Her name's Tina. I haven't talked to her. I haven't talked to a Tina yet. <SEP> W-. The call was probably for her. They wouldn't accept my T I N number. So we put hers in. But like I said we're getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party. <SEP> But some of. I've only talked to one or two. And they've all been in Dallas. But she hasn't talked to anybody in Dallas yet. So that's interesting. You haven't told me what sports that you are active in. <SEP> The sport I like best probably is basketball. But I guess I'm probably better at softball. And so I'd. During the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my time. But I play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend. But my family usually goes with me. We try to do everything we can together. I think that's easy entertainment for a family too. <SEP>. They. A good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we. That's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff. And they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age. So they play together pretty well. Under the stands. <SEP> And. Under the bleachers. <SEP> Pretty much. And Tina enjoys the other lady real well. <SEP> So they. That's kind of nice. It's like getting together with them. It's getting a little hot isn't it? <SEP> So to speak. It. It's been raining a lot here so far. So we haven't really had any kind of real heat. I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in the house. So it looks like an air conditioner day. <SEP> But. It sure does. Or maybe this evening anyway. It. But I'm sure you're familiar with that living here. Very much so. <SEP> We go through Enid quite a bit. We go to Tulsa from time to time. And my parents live in southern Illinois. So we drive up there. <SEP> And lot of times we take seventy-five. And it seems like that goes through Enid. It doesn't. <SEP> I've either seen the signs or. Enid is. It's in the northwest. It's directly across the state from Tulsa. I know I've seen the sign somewhere. Sure you have. <SEP> Enid is not an unknown little city. It. <SEP> An awful lot of people know where it is or have been there. And it was a very self-sufficient wealthy town for a long time anyway. Until everything happened. <SEP>. The bottom fell out. But. <SEP> It's beginning to do well. But there's a lot of old time wealth there that has helped to stabilize things. <SEP> So how l-. You said you've just lived in North Carolina just six months then is. Si-. Something like that. <SEP> And you really like it there? I've heard so many people talk about that area. I've never been there. It's pretty. <SEP> But they sure say it's pretty. The weather is wonderful. This winter we. It was just. We had so many wonderful days. And. <SEP> I. If it got to be forty degrees I decided it was too cold to walk the dogs. Isn't it funny how your standards change? <SEP>. It really does. My wife and I spent a couple years doing church work up in the state of Washington right on the coast. <SEP> And it rains a lot there. But you get used to it. It's like a fine mist all the time. And it doesn't really. It gets to where it doesn't bother you. <SEP> Carolina this part is very much like that too. Very foggy and misty. <SEP> It. The moss grows on the trees in the woods up eight ten feet. <SEP>. <SEP> That's the way it was there too. I think however that's like February. I know it did it all February. And some people said to me `` that's our wintertime. ''. I know you need to go. <SEP> But. And I've enjoyed talking to you. I have enjoyed talking to you too. It was nice to talk to you. So much. <SEP> Have a. I hope you enjoy North Carolina. Thank you. <SEP> And I hope you enjoy and get through that birthday party. <SEP> I hope I live through it. I do too. <SEP> That's what I hope. A lot.
