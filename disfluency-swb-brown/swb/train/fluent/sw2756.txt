And what part of Virginia? I live down in the south western part of Blacksburg. Blacksburg. I've been. <SEP> Have you ever heard of Virginia Tech? Sounds vaguely familiar. V P I. <SEP> I hadn't been down in that part of the state really. We vacation a lot. How about you? Quite frequently. I wish we did. <SEP> We retired early. So we take trips pretty often. Where all you guys go? <SEP> We go to Maine every Fall. Then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast. <SEP> And I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico. So we go out there. And we go to Florida. And down. We were just out recently at the outer banks of North Carolina. All these places that I've never been. <SEP> Is that right. Where do you go? What type of vacation? It really depends. Seems like I do a lot in the Midwest lately. My fiancee's family's from Wisconsin. <SEP> And so we've been out there a couple of times. And I went to Purdue for a couple of years. So I've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends. And I'm a real big baseball fan. So I usually try to combine it with catching a couple of games somewhere. <SEP> What club do you follow? I'm a big Red Sox fan. Red S-. But I. <SEP> Me too. You're a Red Sox fan too? I usually try to catch whoever's in town though I don't specifically. I go to Cleveland to see them play the Indians or the Red Sox. <SEP> That's about it. We do a lot of little trips around here. And. Ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains. Or. Not that much. We've gone out to a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water. <SEP> Have you ever heard of it? I've heard of it. I've never been there. It's really neat. It's this house built on a waterfall. And it's really cool. <SEP> Of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there. The first time we went out there was the day after hurricane Hugo had come through. <SEP> So they didn't have any power. And it was really cold and rainy. And we went up about a year later. And it was better but not a whole lot better. So where else did we go. We've gone to Richland last year and had a good time down there. <SEP> Did you? Did you go to Williamsburg. <SEP> Have you been down there? My girlfriend has with her sisters. But I haven't been down there. I hear that's nice. We're going to get probably down Norfork sometime this Summer just to catch a football game actually. <SEP> We were down. When we came back from the outer banks we came up due Norfork and spent the night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night. Spend a day and a lot of money. <SEP> I've heard. I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the price attached to it. We just. I. <SEP> But it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around if you like to walk. It's a good town to just walk in. We'll do that. <SEP> You can go to the buildings and not go in if you're not. So I can wander around without. <SEP> You can wander. It's a good town to wander in. I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings? That's right. I didn't know that. I think they do the whole with paying. <SEP> They really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another. But they had a good time. So. <SEP> We really didn't do that really this time we just visited around. We've done it a couple of times. And that's enough for probably another twenty years. I was. We use it live in California. And my. Up around San Francisco. And there was one year when my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles. So my father was working down in Los Angeles for six months or so. Actually I think it was closer to a full year. And he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays. Any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles. So I went to Disneyland about five times in one year. <SEP> And I really have no great urge to go back now. That's great as a kid though isn't it. It was great because the times that were really fun were when we had vacation. But the kids in Los Angeles didn't. <SEP> So we basically had one of the parks. There's still a lot of people at Disneyland. But there was another amusement park down there Busch Gradens. There was nobody there when we were there we won a log floating ride five straight times. We just get done with them and they go do you want to go again. <SEP> Have you ever. You've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney. I'd like to sometime. <SEP> That's good. But. We really enjoy that. We've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter. I've never been. The fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte. <SEP> So I keep wanting to get further. I thought I would go to Florida a couple Summers ago. But never did it. <SEP> Charleston is a really nice place to visit. My sister lives in Charlotte. And they've gone to Charleston a couple of times and had a real good time. <SEP> It's a real pretty place. One of these days we'll get down there although. I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it. <SEP> We're getting married in about a year. Are you. And our honeymoon we're going up to this place in Wisconsin called Door County. <SEP> It's up by Green Bay. It's a place my girlfriend's also wanted to go. And. <SEP> Is it on one of the lakes? It's. I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin. But there's kind of a little thing sticking out in the Lake Michigan. That's Door County. <SEP> That would be really nice. They call it the Cape Cod of the Midwest. <SEP> So we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun. She had this book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide. <SEP> Sounds good. So that should be a lot of fun. I don't know what our next trip will be I guess our next. I know what my next trip I'm going to be a grandmother in July. <SEP> The first one. So my next trip is going to be to Texas. That'll be fun. <SEP> In the middle of the Summer. You won't even notice it though. <SEP> They'll be air-conditioning anyway. So. Is that how you got into this data base? <SEP> My daughter's a temp at Texas Instruments and working on this project. I was just. Most of the people I've talk to are from Texas. <SEP> So when I heard you were from Virginia I was there's somebody different. And you said I got somebody down in Texas. I go that the connection right there. That's it. <SEP> I talked to one in California. I never asked him the other day how he was connected. I don't think he was T I employee. I. Most people talk to Texas. There's been a couple of other the people most of whom are like me that work in speech labs that are going to use data base eventually. I see. So it was fun. Actually yesterday I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in. <SEP> Is that right. We spent last week end in Charlotte with real good friends that had just moved back East from Oklahoma. <SEP> And she's working on this project too. She's talking on the project too. <SEP> And we got back Monday. And I got a call yesterday. And it was her on T I Network. That's neat. I haven't had something like that happen just getting the one guy from the lab. <SEP> You're sure have a nice town. My sister lives on Lake Norman just. Does she. <SEP> That's nice out there. We keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the Summer. And it's never really works out. <SEP> It's real pretty. Traffic not much else we do for vacation really. Just so we haven't been able to take really. <SEP> Are you a golfer? Me either. Are you guys golfers. <SEP> Or. Not too much into sports. Except our outside though. <SEP> Just walking that's all. I don't think there are any traveling that was in my early teens down in that area. And I'm know real sure there are. No professionals. I was thinking I might be minor league. But. <SEP> There's one in Salem Salem Rebels. Salem Rebels. Buccaneers. <SEP> Buccaneers. I may be seeing them in a town just west of here Frederick has a minor league team that plays in the same league with Salem. And I think we may be seeing them this weekend. <SEP> Is that right up there in Frederick? I think they're out of town. That's a nice little town actually Frederick. <SEP> I've never been up there. I've never visited Baltimore. I'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime. There's some nice things in Baltimore. The Inner Harbor and the Aquarium and all that are very nice. They've just done a. I. The Aquarium is one of those things that because everybody.
