What kind of hobbies do you have? I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when I do have spare time. I like cross-stitch too. <SEP> I love it. I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately. That's my case also. I've got a new born. And there's just no time. <SEP> Have you been cross-stitching long? Several years. My husband is even interested in it now. He likes to help me design projects that are a little more customized. <SEP> He looks at the pattern. And he says how do you get that from there to the material. Not that hard. It's not. I really enjoy it. <SEP> And once you get started on it I love it. I do a lot of my own patterns also. <SEP> In fact I did one BILL THE CAT from Glenn County that was a real good one to do. It was tough. But. Do you have any others. Or is this mainly cross-stitching? I do mostly that. Not very artistic really for painting and stuff. <SEP>. But I don't know. I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors. I've got the kits to put them all in. I don't have them all yet certainly. <SEP>. I got to counting the other day. And I think I have two hundred. And I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is. It can add up quick. I just keep an inventory of what I currently have. And then when I start a new project I go through and see if I. Just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on. <SEP>. I see. Now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead what comes close. Because a lot of them are similar. <SEP> A lot of times you can do that. I think I. The pinks there's forty-two different shades of pink. There's lots of pinks and greens. Pinks and greens. <SEP> There's lots of shades of greens. But the colors. I just love all the different colors. They had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to. But you don't have much spare time either? Not lately. I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there. <SEP> And that does take some time. And if we're trying to get acclimated with having a baby. And. How old? He's seven months old. <SEP> And just into everything. So there's not a spare moment. But I wouldn't trade it for the world. I've been trying to do some bibs for him. And work on his Christmas stocking. <SEP> We missed it last year. So hopefully this year he'll have one. Last year he was a little bit young for having one. <SEP> He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway. You would have. But. <SEP> If it tasted good. All he liked was the lights this year. So. That's neat that you like cross-stitching also. That's kind of strange that we got the same call. <SEP> It's a call. I'm sorry. Go ahead. That's okay. <SEP> But. I've been doing it for probably ten years or so. I just started about five years ago I think. But it is peaceful. It is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it. There's also a couple of large projects baby afghans. And I got one done. And I think. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished. <SEP> On that. Bear thing. Is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the large squares? I bought the cloth and the pattern for it. I didn't buy a kit. <SEP> I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching. It's that cloth. It's cloth I think. <SEP> And it has the borders and everything already. Those are pretty. Number one turned out just great. And the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery. And I didn't even know it. <SEP> That's a. I gave it to her. And she said how did you know those are the colors we used. I said didn't. That was a good. It worked out that way. <SEP> That's great. That. Now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it. I like those. Those are pretty. Lilly she said it's for your daughter to use. She said I know she doesn't get to touch it. She hung it on the wall. <SEP> My grandmother made us a couple of quilts for the baby. And I was I don't want to mess those up. They're just too nice. You don't get many hand made quilts anymore. <SEP>. I've enjoyed this. <SEP> But keep up the good. Keep up the cross-stitching. You too. <SEP>
