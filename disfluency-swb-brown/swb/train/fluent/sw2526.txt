What kind of car are you thinking about buying next? What do we currently have. I have a Subaru G O X T. What year? <SEP> Eighty-eight. I have a ninety Honda Civic. And I'm ready to get rid of it. Actually. It's not pretty old. I had an eighty-eight that I really liked. And it got wrecked. And so I bought a ninety because I really liked my eighty-eight. And I've had a lot of problems with this one. So. <SEP> You think their quality control's going down over there kind of? You. It's kind of funny. I know a lot. I think we're going to see that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit while American carmakers are trying to get their put together. <SEP> So. It's true. It's definitely true because. <SEP> But that's one reason. I've had no problems with my Subaru. That's one reason I went with it because Subaru had a good reputation for low maintenance. So. Honda does too that's why I was really. There's no question. But you have a nineteen. I've got to see if. I've seen and I've had friends that have eighty-one or eighty Celicas. <SEP> And those things just keep ticking. They can rack up a hundred fifty K on them. That's true. <SEP> And they're still beating on them. That's true. And it's just amazing. And then they got. And they're not making them like that now. <SEP> Not at all. But they're still definitely better than the American carmaker system. I definitely agree with you there because I had uh Ford T Bird before I got my Honda. And it was the worst car I've ever owned. <SEP> And that's why I was so tickled with my Honda. It was just a wonderful car. And then it got wrecked. And I wouldn't even look at another car. I just went and bought a Honda I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want. And I really have had a lot of problems with it. But I don't know. <SEP> Maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-. I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty. But in the first twelve months that I owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month. It was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months. That's a lot. It was. I was really disappointed because I was so hyped up on Honda. So. <SEP>. Anyway. So what's your next purchase supposed to be? I know this. <SEP> If you had a choice of your car what would you get? This is going to sound really strange. But I really like to have a Mazda M P V van. I really like those. And I have kids. So. I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that. They're a lot. I don't like the new style of the Toyota van and the new Chevy Lumina van. <SEP>. I don't like those styles the M P V is more just normal. I don't know how to explain more of an old fashioned type. I'm not sure how to explain it. <SEP> It looks kind of like the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow. What. Astro is what it something like that. <SEP> But I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than. Do you have a family? I have a couple kids. <SEP> That's probably influenced maybe a little bit. But I know that it's got to have a radio it's got to have air conditioning. I'm sure you can relate to air conditioning. Living in Arizona. And cruise control and tinted windows that's about it. It's got to have those things otherwise I don't care. <SEP> When I bought my car it was right out of college. And I always been looking for something sporty. And I ended up getting basically something that I could afford. The only gripe I have is performance. I probably. A few girls that I've gone out with've had Mazda R X sevens and stuff. And they're pretty fun to drive. So I think that's what I'm going to have to get next time around I keep holding off. <SEP> And then I could upgrade now if I wanted to. But I. It's just such a huge expense. And I'm just going to keep holding off. But I'm definitely going to look for something in the nice perpor-. Sports car. <SEP> I'd like to have a sports car too. But it's not practical for me. But. I'm in. Are you still there? There's some kind of problems. <SEP> Are you still there? This is. Something's wrong. <SEP> Wonder what happened. I don't know. It sounds funny though doesn't it? But I'll probably. <SEP> It just depends. I know that's what I want. But I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money. For a new R X seven or a Supra or something. You're looking at twenty-five K or something that. At least. And so but my ultimate car though the one that I really want is uh five sixty or so Mercedes. I know new cars aren't cheap anyway. <SEP> But. So. <SEP> Maybe someday. We all have those kind of dreams too don't we? What I'd really like to have. <SEP> That's the only one that I. Early on it says you there? This is strange. I think something's wrong with this. <SEP> I hope it's recording. I hope it's not my. You there? <SEP> It may be my phone. It's the only car that says sporty and class. So. You're right. Kind of what I'm. But it's. At the other one my brother's got a Miata. And those are fun. Those are nice. <SEP> And. They're cute cars. He had a red Miata. <SEP> And he actually. They came out with a European racing green Miata that's a limited edition. They're only going to make three or four thousand. So he went out. And he traded the other one in and got this one. I haven't seen those. <SEP> And I'm but I haven't seen one yet either. But supposedly they have some real wood built in to the clutch and all this and the steering wheel. So it's very authentic. And there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be a good investment. If it. <SEP> No matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on. But I think. <SEP> I got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway hope it's not going bad. It's going to bump me out. But I think he only spent the low twentys. So I don't know. <SEP> I would have never figured that I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition. I don't know. I think the demand's gone all down a little bit. I think you can. The prices aren't as high. And the Miata was first introduced. And they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they? <SEP> Wh-. The demand is so high that they were going to retail them around thirteen standard. And you get your options you're looking at fifteen. That's true. <SEP> But people were buying them for nineteen and twenty. And they may have gone down a little bit. <SEP> But I. They're still pretty much in demand. I think there's another car coming in. It's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata. And I can't remember what I read about that. But so that's. I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular. So. It really is. <SEP> But. Have you seen the new Dodge Stealth? the real nice one. <SEP> And the Mitsubishi three thousand G T is the same. <SEP> The Mitsubishi is real nice looking too. That's the same manufacturer. Those are nice. <SEP> So they just market them. <SEP> But. Those are supposed to be very performance power there is big time. The expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand. But those are pretty stripped. And there's nothing. There's really. That one's just more for looks. It doesn't have really the performance that the expensive one does. <SEP> But I've seen one of those. And it's not that great because they really. I think they're only around twenty-nine K. The-. They have better. It's not quite as nice for a little bit less. <SEP> They're not really that bad. But I don't know. Like I said it's still not practical for me. I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think there's no way I can do that. I'm being single. And no other responsibilities for yourself I've been pretty happy. <SEP> I haven't tried to upgrade myself right now. I could get something nice and upgrade. But I'm consulting right now. So. I just made my first job hop about eight months ago. So.
