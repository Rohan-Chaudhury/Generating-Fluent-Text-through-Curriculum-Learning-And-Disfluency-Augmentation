Up there maybe you guys don't have as big a problem with air pollution as many do you? We have a terrible air pollution problem. Do you really? <SEP> Our summers are extremely hazardous. And during certain wind directions because we get the Gary Indiana Chicago pollution. <SEP> And we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze coming up along the lake. That's horrible. <SEP> And they do post warnings for people who have heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season. <SEP> In the winter it's not as severe. But if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. <SEP> The State of Wisconsin as a matter of fact started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. I don't think it's going to go very far. But it was a way of triggering awareness. <SEP> So what's the conditions like in Dallas? In Dallas I haven't seen air pollution quite on a level that we had in Denver. I grew up in Denver. And I've lived there most of my life. And we used to have the posted warning days. However in Colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down. Probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now as far as health concerns. Due to the emissions control on the vehicles seems that all of our smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry. <SEP> Wisconsin has a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for their pollution control equipment. And if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it is drivable. <SEP> So they've tried to do a lot of that. And I thi-. There seem to be at least in certain little pockets. And we were talking earlier about Madison. <SEP> Madison has one of the nicest bike road sharing programs of any city in Wisconsin. And all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of bike trails for recreational use of any of the states. <SEP> And there is a real promotion of biking. <SEP> But there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere. I find that a little irritating because I don't think it's always so necessary. <SEP> It becomes. Maybe to you and I who have grown up in some more beautiful parts of the country I think that we become a little more aware rather quickly of what's happening with air pollution and how horrible it really is. I notice people in Dallas seem to say there's air pollution but how bad could this problem really be. Send them to Wisconsin. <SEP> And we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from the acid rain. <SEP> And they may wake up. How'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain. <SEP> It's really a serious issue for those of us up in this sector up here. Or do you hypothesize that most of the smog or air pollution comes from vehicles. Or does it come mostly from industry up there? <SEP> I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of the Gary area. <SEP> And I don't know exactly where it emerges from when it's up in the northern sectors of Wisconsin. That causes the acid rain. That I'm a little uncertain of. But I do know that it is a problem. <SEP> I had talked with my parents. I was born in Muncie Indiana and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute. And I had asked them before. I went back to visit recently about a year ago. And I asked them. I said did you ever realize the air pollution that was.
