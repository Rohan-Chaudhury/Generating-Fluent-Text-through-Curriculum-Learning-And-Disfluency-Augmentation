What are your music interests? Just about any kind of music except acid rock. <SEP> I don't care for acid rock. Me too. <SEP> But I grew up with country and western. I did too. But. Just about any kind of music. And then. <SEP> I even like classical music. I'm pretty diversified too. I don't like acid rock either. I grew up in a small town. So we only had one radio station. So it was country music. But then when I. <SEP> I grew up with Hank Snow and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs. You're older than I am. But I. Did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway? We don't get Channel Two. Our cable doesn't. <SEP> I wish we got that what. But. That is fabulous. Was it? We don't get Channel Two. <SEP> We. When he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing. <SEP> And it was tremendous. He is a. Actually I did. I played flute for almost ten years. <SEP> So I appreciate his too his mus-. He's from Ireland isn't he? <SEP> And it was mostly all Irish tunes. Was i-. They had a band with him that had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the tin whistle and a couple of violins and uh drum. <SEP> And they played all the Irish jigs and so forth. It was just fabulous. He is really good. I come from a musical background. <SEP> So I've played flute and piano. So I have a big appreciation for music up to a point. <SEP> I'm getting now to the age where I don't like much of the new stuff that's coming out. <SEP> My husband says I'm getting old. I especially like instrumentals. Do you? <SEP> I love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen. That's nice to do that is. I've got a two year old who's now getting. I'm getting well versed in kiddy music. I've never played an instrument in my life. I've always wanted too. <SEP> I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something. But. But I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music. I was one of the forced ones. <SEP> I could never do that. And. I was never that brave. But. <SEP> I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir. I've done that at church too. I haven't done that in a long time. <SEP> So let's see. What els-. What kind of music do you not like? Like I say the acid rock. I just do not ca-. An I don't care for rap music either. That's not music. <SEP> That is not. I don't know what that is. But that's not music. If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it. It's not music. It's just talking in a beat. It's not exciting at all. <SEP> It doesn't give you relaxation. You can't dance to it. You can't do anything to it. <SEP> But I and I like orchestra music too. Like the Boston Pops or anything. D-. <SEP> Have you ever been to the Dallas Symphony? <SEP> Have you? Are they good? <SEP> They're good. Are they? I have never been. And we went and saw LES MISERABLES. <SEP> The music in that was fantastic. I've heard that that is a really. <SEP> I heard that was hard to get tickets to. It. I can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets. <SEP> But it was out at the State Fair Music Hall. And it was well worth the price. That was a real. Was it? <SEP> I bet it was. I really bet it was. Is that the only musical. Do you go see a lot of musicals? <SEP> Just ever so often a real good one like that one. And. That would be nice. <SEP> I went and saw SUGAR BABIES. That was good. That had good music in it. Was it? How. I don't know what that's about. That was the one with Mickey Rooney. And what's that not real old dancer. <SEP> I can't think of her name. I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it Helen something. I think I know who you're ta- I know who you're talking about. Real long legs and dark hair. She's got black hair. <SEP> I know who you're talking about. I can't think ever her name either. I can't think of it. That was. I remember that being here a few years ago. <SEP> But. The last country music. My parents still really like country music. <SEP> And they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers. And my parents. <SEP> The Blackwoods. My husband likes country music real well. And he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah. And. He really likes Shenandoah. <SEP> Alabama. Alabama. I think they're a bit over exposed. <SEP> I get tired of every other song being Alabama on the radio. <SEP> Either Alabama or Hank Williams Junior. I've never cared for Hank Williams Junior. <SEP> I never have either. And I never have figured out how he won entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row. <SEP> We watch those award shows too. We enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff. But I just don't care for him. I just never have. I don't. <SEP> I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is probably Eddy Arnold. Is it? I think I know who that is. I think my parents have some of his records. <SEP> But I had some I sold some of them I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western songs. <SEP> Smiley Burnette I don't know if you were old enough to remember him. I've heard the name. He played in the old western movies. He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe. <SEP> Or they. I think his name in the movie was Froggy. And. I've never seen a Gene Autry movie. Had a real raspy voice. <SEP> And. Some of those old ones of course Bob Wills Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an. I never have. <SEP> Those go back quite a way. I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them. <SEP> But my mother and dad use to own a restaurant. It's hard to. <SEP> And they had a nickelodeon of course in the restaurant. And when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records. That wou-. That's neat. <SEP> So that's where I got my. That would be great if they weren't too worn out at the time. <SEP> Of course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records. Is there not? You'd think there would be. The problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that particular kind of needle. That's true. <SEP> And they just won't play on a modern day phonograph. <SEP> That's a shame. Because we go to antique stores a lot. And you see seventy-eights a lot at record stores. <SEP> You'd think there'd be a market for. I'm sure you could find old players for them. But that would cost a fortune if you could find them that worked. <SEP>. <SEP> Of course they just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because you get that scratchy sound. Those things were big and thick weren't they? <SEP> You could kill somebody with them. Th-. Warped real easy. And the ones you buy. Go out and buy one now. And they're just so thin and flimsy. <SEP> And they're not meant to last at all. Neither are tapes. We buy cassette tapes. <SEP> And machines will eat them. And so the best bet these days are compact disk. Those things are practically indestructible. <SEP> But I guess the old country and western music you. Back then when I was a kid there wasn't that much T V. So that's all you had to listen to was the radio. Radio. <SEP> And. That's just what you had. We-. Plus. I think it was better back then to. There's too much T V now. <SEP> And the radio is more exciting really than television. Kep-. Your imagination. <SEP> I- kept. And yo-. It just didn't vegetate your mind like television does. I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera. <SEP> Was it on the radio every week? What day was that on. Can you recall. <SEP> Seems like it was on a Friday. Friday or.
