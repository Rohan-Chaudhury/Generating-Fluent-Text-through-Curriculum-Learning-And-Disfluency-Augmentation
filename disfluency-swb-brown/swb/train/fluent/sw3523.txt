We're set. What changes do you feel have happened? <SEP> I guess the first thing has been for the right for women to vote. I think that has been a major change and also the fact that there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were. And that's probably going to increase. Increases each year doesn't it? <SEP> I'm sorry? It increases each year I think. It sure does. There is a lot more women in the work place nowadays. And I think women have kind of had in the past the real subservient role. <SEP> Role? And. <SEP> That's changing. We do to some degree. But I think it's not as much as it was. <SEP> I agree. It definitely has changed. And especially with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more from men. <SEP> Because there is just impossible to keep up on everything else. Have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home. <SEP> They've been talking about. And I don't know what the status is on it. But women get maternity leave and stuff like that. And I know that there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out. But I haven't really heard much about that recently. There is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason. <SEP> In fact I know the school districts down here they don't have maternity leave. You simply have to accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave. Is that right? <SEP>. And I don't know if bigger company companies do. But when I was employed with the school district I didn't have maternity leave either. And that was the reason. Because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men. So. <SEP> That's interesting. That's a bummer though. It is. <SEP> You got to take the time off. You have to save all of your vacation time. You do. You have to save all your vacation time. And that's usually how it's happened. <SEP> But. What do you see changing in the future? <SEP> I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies run by females. And top level. And we'll prob-. <SEP> I'm sorry? Maybe top level. Upper management. More women in upper management. And probably we'll see more females in political roles. More governors and roles like that. That would be kind of nice. <SEP> In Texas we have a female governor. That's right. That's right. And we had a female mayor here in Dallas. And her term just ended. So I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future. <SEP> I think that's probably good. A little more integration. And maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners. And. <SEP> And that's fine with me. I think. But sometimes. I'm not a women's libber by any means. But I do. <SEP> There are issues that as far as equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff I totally am for. But I don't get into the real women libber movement. I don't either. <SEP> I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal. We just function differently. <SEP> And I'm not capable of lifting what a man can lift and that type of thing. But one of the big changes they're doing in Salt Lake is. <SEP> And they're probably. I'm sure in Dallas since you're big places a lot more women are working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever. I've heard of that. I haven't really talked to anybody that's too involved with that. But I think that is a. I think that. <SEP> Like the cottage industry. Is that what you're talking about women working out of their homes? I think it's wonderful. You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week. And. <SEP> Course they're talking about that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that. I kn-. <SEP> By the phone and all that. So it would be kind of exciting in some ways to see a little bit more of that. And some ways it might be kind of scary. Think anybody could do it. But. <SEP> I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up. <SEP> But then there is the process of selection. Would you have to give them the brand. And when you shop you usually compare the prices. <SEP> And would be nice though.
