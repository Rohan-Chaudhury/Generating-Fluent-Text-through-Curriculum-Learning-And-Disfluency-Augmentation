. First I need to know how do you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home? Of course it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do. Unless it's just really for their own good. <SEP> I'd be very very careful checking them out. Our. Had t- place my mother in a nursing home. She had a rather massive stroke about eight months ago. And I was fortunate in that. I was personally acquainted with the people who ran the nursing home in our little hometown. <SEP> So I was very comfortable in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it. But there's. I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while. That was really not a very good experience. It had to be done in a hurry. We didn't have six months to check all of these places out. And it was really not very good deal. We were not really happy with nursing home that we finally had. <SEP> Fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks. And she was able to return to her apartment again. But it's really a big decision as to when to do it. Is there something else we could have done in checking out all the places that might be available. Of course there's not one on every corner especially smaller areas smaller towns. <SEP>. Probably the hardest thing in my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home. And she had used the walker for quite some time probably about six to nine months. And she had a fall. And finally she had Parkinson's disease. <SEP> And it got so much that she could not take care of her house. Then she lived in an apartment. And that was even harder actually. <SEP>. Because it was just a change of location. And it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling. <SEP> She had children all across the United States. And she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children. <SEP>. And that was pretty heart-rending for her. I can imagine. I think when she finally came to the realization that I can not take care of myself. <SEP> That's tough. That's tough. For somebody who for most of their life has not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines. <SEP> And facing that situation it's quite a dilemma. I think. <SEP> My mother. Go ahead. My. Probably one of the biggest decisions that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it. I think that they had a great deal of. All the brothers and sisters got together. And they actually had a conference. <SEP> That's great. And it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that. That's right. And just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them. And making that decision and then finding a place. <SEP>. And everybody had duties to perform. Whether it was just giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot of the decision making like finding a proper nursing home. <SEP>. <SEP> You were very fortunate. And they. I know. And they had seen it coming. <SEP> So. It. I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me. <SEP>. Unfortunately a lot of times responsibilities like that seem to fall to maybe one child in the whole family. We. And it's usually not a very smooth thing. <SEP> I was lucky too that I only have one brother. And fortunately we agreed on exactly what we thought should be done. My mother also was very independent. She still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty-three. <SEP> We were lucky in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really much aware of what was going on. That nursing home life would not have been anything of her choosing. Of course she would not have been happy there at all. <SEP> But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us. With my grandmother it was such that she did not have the problem with. She was very well aware. And her daughter came and visited her. At least her daughter came and visited her and also her several grandchildren came and visited her every day. <SEP>. <SEP> That's great. And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest. I think it would be. It was more of a relief for her. <SEP> And. But she was truly aware. I don't know how I would deal if one of my parents came with Alzheimer's. Or something like that which is far more devastating. <SEP> That would be tough. And I think that one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily the quantity of care but the quality of care. <SEP>. That the people that worked there were very interested to make it as close a home environment as possible. <SEP>. <SEP>. It would. I think for myself I see that as probably what everything would hinge upon. <SEP> Is it. How close is it to a home environment. That's right. That's probably the major question. <SEP> I think that great strides are being made nowadays in caring for the elderly in a whole lot of areas. <SEP> Just people are of course populations getting older. It's interesting that the population of the United States is changing because now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time. Matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families. <SEP> It wasn't. But I guess as we become more industrialized and less in a rural situation we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier. <SEP>. <SEP> That's right. <SEP>. And things are scattered so much nowadays. I think that perhaps the extended family it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care. <SEP> Of course there comes other issues whether we feel like they're going to be a good caretaker for our children. But. <SEP> Just because they're grandparents. They raised us after all. Just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer. But I think that I've had a lot of good experiences with many people especially where they've had extended family. And I kind of see that perhaps we may need to get close to the family environment and get down to the values of. <SEP> It's. Money seems to be too big of an issue. With what's going on today. <SEP> Realistically it is. And I think that may be perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem. <SEP> That would certainly help. We may not have as high a standard of living. <SEP> But actually have a truer standard of living. <SEP> That's just a matter of defining priorities or some priorities anyway. <SEP> I think you're right. I guess that was it. It was good talking to you. <SEP>. Take care. <SEP>.
