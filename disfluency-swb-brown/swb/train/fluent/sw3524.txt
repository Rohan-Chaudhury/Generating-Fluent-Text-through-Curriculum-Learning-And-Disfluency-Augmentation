I say Arlington Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington Virginia. And Plano Texas rather than Plano Illinois. Do they have one? <SEP> They do. I didn't know that. I learned something already. <SEP> Let's see. The three questions are what. How much time do you spend with your children? Very little. Because they're grown. <SEP> What? They're grown and gone. Mine is down at U T Austin at college. And the other one is in high school. <SEP> So you do spend less time then? C-. <SEP> Because they almost don't want to know us. They want to be with their friends. How old are your kids? Are they married or what? I have two married and then two almost married. And the other two I'm not sure. Two for sure are single. <SEP> You have a lot of kids. Between the spouse and myself we have six. That's kind of nice though. You shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday? <SEP> Because I came with a split family. And she had. <SEP> There is so much of them are gone. And they're doing their own things. And a lot of times they've got when the holidays. That's true. They have to see their other parent too. <SEP> And sometimes they want to do their own thing. So sometimes it's just spouse and me. I know. <SEP> And you know what? What? Sometimes that's okay. I know. <SEP> Because. That's what my mother said one time. Because who says that they just got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays. <SEP> That's true. And if they force them to that's not good either. <SEP> That becomes a drudgery. And let's see. Do they all live in the area? Of the six we've got four around here. <SEP> We're talking north Texas. And then one is in Vermont Montpelier Montpelier Vermont. <SEP> And the other one is in Everett Washington. How did they end up so far away? That's my little pair. And my second marriage. <SEP> And. Those are the youngest ones? The s-. The fourth and fifth child of the six are the two that are scattered like that. <SEP> Those are a long way. And they wanted to go. How. <SEP> J R my middle son fell in love with Washington state. <SEP> And the third daughter fell in love with Vermont. Vermont. So. So they wanted to make their homes there. <SEP> That's where they've gone to make their homes. Are those two married? They just working up there or going to school or what? <SEP> Let's see. I guess you'd say J R is working trying to go to school. I wish to God he would go back. They do. Especially if they're meant to I think. <SEP> I certainly hope so. I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T. And I'm going to U T A right now myself. So it's never too late. <SEP> I agree it's never too late. <SEP> And. Especially in some of these schools around here I think they have about twenty percent older students. And when you're saying older we're talking fifty up. I've seen some people that are really quite up there they look like in their very late sixties. <SEP> And I say that's great why not. <SEP> Why not because that's a lot of times it's. I believe that we in that category. And I'm not in that category quite yet. But we are seasoned minds. You're really ready to learn finally. <SEP> I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen. It was. It was a complete waste of money. <SEP> Settle down. We know what we're wanting to study. And we know our limitations. We. And. <SEP> And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether. We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning. <SEP> At seven. We're past that age. We're smarter now. We know what we can do. <SEP> So let's see. So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here. And so the second question forgot what the second question. What was it. What do the trends in families. And do we approve what other families do. <SEP> The trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing. That's right. <SEP> But I'm seeing a change that government can't do it. A change? I was going to say the same thing. <SEP> Schools are not able to. <SEP> And between a person's religion their faith in their maker whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever. <SEP> And the family. Are going to have to solve some of the problem. Those are the two that have the wherewithal. And of course Judeo-Christianity and of the Jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the mission by the Lord to do this very thing. <SEP> So when another group of people step in try to do it they're tromping on our territory so to speak. So. I firmly believe that.
