What movies do you like? I like just about anything. I think the last one we saw was TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO. I like the turtles. My little boy's four. And he loves them. <SEP> We don't have any kids. But we like them anyway. That's okay. How old are you all? We're late twenties. And you just don't have any yet. <SEP> I've got two. My little girl is three months old. And my little boy just turned four. I had his birthday party yesterday. <SEP> But he's a turtle fanatic. He even had turtle cake yesterday. But I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO. Is it as good as they say it is? <SEP> It was. It was actually better than the first one I thought. What's the last movie you saw? GHOST. <SEP> When the topic came up I was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw. He said GHOST and TURTLES. I really liked it. GHOST. I love tearjerker movies. But that wasn't too bad on tearjerker. But it was good movie. Not too awful bad. Though I can see why it won so many Oscars. <SEP> Because that was just so good. And I like Demi Moore. Did you see PRETTY WOMAN? But I've been hearing a lot about it. We don't get to the video store very often. And we don't have cable. <SEP> We don't really want cable. It's just glued to the T V all the time anyway. So we get two channels down here. I'm from Kentucky originally. <SEP> And we used to get five channels without cable. Forty. I don't think you all have the same channels. But here in Texas we only get two channels. And that's. Do you watch soap operas? <SEP> Once in a while when I'm home. You work then? We get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it. <SEP> And then I think GENERAL HOSPITAL. And that comes on different channel. It does. But that's all we get. And that's no cartoons for my little boy. But we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes. <SEP> And my husband is a movie fanatic. I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN. It was really a. It made you feel really good. It was just a happy movie. What about TOTAL RECALL. Have you seen that. <SEP> I saw that one. That's good. I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was. It was violent. I try to get away from that. My little boy he loves ROBO COP. And that movie I'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is. Have you seen it? <SEP> The part where they're shooting mercy. I don't like that. That's horrible. That is horrible. And the language on that's filthy. <SEP> I don't see why they have to do that. Everybody knows that the language is there so they could just ignore it and use different words instead I think. <SEP> I know. But I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite. I went and bought the video. I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times. My husband bought me PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday. With a. Wait a second. I will in a minute Kyle. <SEP> That's okay. He bought me PRETTY IN PINK. Just a second. You're glad you ain't got a four year old. That's okay. I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK. This is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls. <SEP> Does that have Molly Ringwald? Molly Ringwald. It was cute. But it wasn't. I like SIXTEEN CANDLES or sixteenth birthday or. <SEP> I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it. That was so good. Of course I was a teenager when I seen that. And I loved it. I haven't seen it either. If you like love stories it's sweet. <SEP> I do. It's sweet. It really is. And that's a tearjerker. It gets you. It makes you feel really sorry for her. But it's hilarious too especially with that little guy in it. He looks like a little boy next door. <SEP> But he's sixteen. It's a cute movie. I can't remember his name. He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER. I don't know. Don't know either. <SEP> Bu-. He's got curly blonde hair. He just a little freckly little boy. Probably know him if I saw him. If I could remember the name I know you'd know his name because he's played in a few movies. But. <SEP> I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. I've heard about that. But I can't remember it. That's Julia Roberts' new movie. Julia Roberts is good. <SEP> She's. This one. You know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance. And this one was a lot more dramatic. Wasn't it a murder mystery? <SEP> Y-. Sort of. It was a mystery. She disappeared from her husband who was abusing her. That's the one I wanted to see where she was at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something. <SEP> Did that come on T V. Or did it come out in the. It came out in the theater. <SEP> And I think around here it's all ready quit playing. But I don't know if it's still playing any where else. I think. But it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat. Real good. <SEP> I want to see that. I seen the previews for it on T V down here. But it's just been down here a couple weeks I think. <SEP> Because we saw it probably four or five months ago. A month a-. I know it hasn't been that long since I've seen the previews for it. But. I wanted to see it. Her husband was a dark haired guy with a beard and moustache. Or a-. He shaved the beard off. <SEP> He was a real psycho in the movie. It was scary. I'd like to see that. What about. There was a. We got one back here a while. I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too. Have you seen that? <SEP> I didn't like it. You didn't? It was. I didn't like the way it ended. I know. The only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night Christopher Reeves told that. <SEP> I can't believe they killed them. Or who was it. Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas. <SEP> Might have been Michael Douglas. That starred in it. It was Michael Douglas. Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all? <SEP>. Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that I can't believe they killed them. And Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas went after his throat you dummy. So I know that they die. But I haven't told my husband. We've both been wanting to see it. <SEP> It was weird. It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen. We was teasing about splitting our house down the middle. They did that didn't they. And they marked off routes that they could go or something. <SEP> That would be kind of hard for us. We've only got one bathroom. I don't know h-. We've got two bathrooms. But mi-. If he takes. My house kind of looks like two trailers put together. And one bathroom is at the end of one side. And one's in the middle of the other. So we could do it. <SEP> That wouldn't be too bad. And he could climb out the window. Wh-. And our whole house has. Every room leads to three rooms. So we can. <SEP> Get around. You can get around. You just can't go out the front door honey. Did you see FATAL ATTRACTION? That's coming back on too. <SEP> I know it's going to be on C B S Tuesday night. And that's kind of in a way how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff. That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was. I. <SEP> Parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny. But then other times it was like it was just deadly serious. And it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling. Eerie feeling. Or I want to see it though. I'd like to see that and THE NEVER ENDING STORY came out on Disney this month I think. I've heard about that. I wanted to see that. <SEP> But I don't know what it's about. THE NEVER ENDING STORY? It's a child's movie. But it's good. I enjoyed it. <SEP> I love Disney movies. I do too. And. They're some of the best that are made. And it's about this little boy who. I think he's up in a attic or some part of school. He got locked in the school. And he got scared. But he starts dreaming. And then he's saving the land of. It's been so long since I've seen it. <SEP> Alls I can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing. Go-. It flies through the air. And he's trying to save the land from some ooze. <SEP> But it's really good. It sounds ki-. It had Fred Savage in it. Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it though. I don't think so. With. He had. It was THE PRINCESS BRIDE. <SEP> I didn't see that. You didn't see that. That was cute. That was a good one. I like slapstick comedy. So do I. And a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something. And you're not sure whether it will be any good or not. So sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than. I heard. A friend of mine told me she got NAKED GUN last night. And she said that was hilarious. <SEP> We saw that. And they're coming out with a sequel to it. Two and a half. It was funny. It wa-. I want to see that. She said she rented it last night. And said it was real good. An. <SEP> And WORKING GIRL is really good. I seen that. That was good. Was that with that blonde. She pretended to be the boss or something. <SEP> I rented that one night by myself. I was home alone. Did you see HOME ALONE? I did. That just reminded me of that. Did you like it?
