To begin. I guess space is real important. So it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time I guess. I agree. <SEP> It's definitely new frontier stuff. But I'm not too up-to-date on the space frontier. But I guess they're going pretty far into it now. Star Wars is not too far I don't think. But. <SEP> I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time. Have you. What do you know about it. <SEP> Actually I'm quite versed lately. I get on a computer network all the time. And people are talking about the current space program all the time. They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that are just like science fiction. It's like they take off. And then they land with the. The afterburners are going not like space shuttle landing gliding down but straight down to the landing pad. <SEP> It's called V C X or something like that. Also called Delta Clipper which is a decent name for something like that. <SEP> I don't know. You think you'd go up in space if you had a chance? Do you. <SEP> I think I would. I think that'd be neat. I think I would just sitting here talking about it. But if the time came it'd be real nervous. I'd be scared. Scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster. That'd be pretty hairy. <SEP> I had a tire come off of a car. So I know what it's like to. Imagine. Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home. I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now wherever. And opening up those stations whatever filling them. <SEP> They're talking about doing that again too. I don't know if we'll ever see that up there. <SEP> At least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years. And they're going to put. That's all beyond my imagination really. <SEP> But science fiction books. You look at the Jetsons cartoon show and it's not too far fetched what they all had in those cartoons. So you never know. Any of that stuff from the Jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would become possible and we have a lot of those. <SEP> So you never know what may occur. But as far as me seeing it I don't know. <SEP> I don't know. But I think it's real vital important for the future generations to come. <SEP> I. It's something definitely that. It's got the extra little oomph of interest. I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too once it's more possible. But when they start showing the drawings and all that I'm sure when they. <SEP> I wish. Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it purely commercial. <SEP> And they'd go up and do things. And. Did they scratch that Star Wars deal they one we was all worried about Russia and all that? <SEP> It's still probably going. But I don't know whether research will go on. But the economy the way it is all over they probably cut back on that because it's not. <SEP> They're going to be cutting back so much on just the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here. <SEP> I know. And then. But Russia's still going to have missiles. They're still going to be subs and things. And we don't know who's handling them now. <SEP> So that's a whole different story now. Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia itself that was going to have them. <SEP> At least that's what everybody says. We want only Russia to have them. And now they're saying Yeah. You're a republic. You don't want those. You don't want those. Some crazy hit man over there with those little republics or whatever. <SEP> They splitting it all up now. And one of them crazy guys get a hold of it. You never know. <SEP> But the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev he's supposed to be on our side isn't he. Pretty much. <SEP> One hopes. I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects. <SEP> But that way you can't never tell that. Kiss some butt. But. <SEP>
