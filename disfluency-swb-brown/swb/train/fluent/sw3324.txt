Just to let you know I have two children of my own. I've got two boys one four year old and one two years old. So I'm just starting out. <SEP> I have two boys who are twenty-eight and twenty-four and a daughter who is twelve. That's quite a spread. <SEP> Same husband everything. That's great. But. One of the things that I like to do with my boys when I get home is I like to try and spend a lot of time with them. They're not very old. So they couldn't do a whole lot yet. <SEP> But they like to spend time with me. We just do various things nothing really. They like to be outside as much as possible. If it's not raining. <SEP> But the weather's trying to turn now. So. Are you down here in Texas? I'm in Dallas. <SEP>. <SEP> You know what I meant with rain. <SEP> What. What one of the trends I've noticed is that it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let them watch movies or play video games or something. I have. Can you hold on just a sec-. <SEP> I have to answer a business phone. I hate to do it on this call. That's okay. <SEP> A R E this is Arlene Lister. It was just a recorded message on our business phone anyway. I'm sorry. Keep going. It's okay. So that was the thing that I noticed that I know a lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing. And one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible. Although it really is very easy to do that type of thing. Just plop them down in front of the T V and let them be entertained that way. <SEP> And seeing as you've got some older children I'm wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up? <SEP> <SEP> There was not nearly as much of it. In fact I think things were quite a bit different. When my big kids were little all the mothers were home. <SEP> The kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around. And then when they felt like it they went out to play when they were little like that. <SEP> And I think it's gotten very different. When my second one was little they were coming out with SESAME STREET which he started watching. And other than that there was not educational T V. Or you got some cartoons. <SEP> And that was it. But they were never that interested in it anyway. They'd take their trucks out in the backyard go out and play and stuff. But we always did just to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum. <SEP> We did a lot of stuff like that with our kids. And course when they got bigger they were both quite into sports. And so whatever they would do we'd go along with. <SEP> And a girl is very different. <SEP> We have. A girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping. So they're very very different. But y-. Kind of the same thing our. She now. Lot of time spent with her. Is going to. <SEP> Last night was a band concert. And she plays on her school volleyball team and stuff like that. But we still like to pack up just go someplace for the day or just stuff like that. <SEP> One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station. That's nice. That's. We go down there fairly often for a weekend for family get-togethers and stuff like that. That's great. <SEP> That's great. I know I'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things. And I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older. But for right now they don't. Just getting out in the front and just being outside is good for them. Because they like just being outside. <SEP> I think our kids just always dearly loved that play bounce the ball or just. <SEP> Course when our big ones were little we lived up north. And this time of the year the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves. <SEP> So it's very different. That's true. You don't see many leaves around Dallas. And come winter time we'd stick them on sleds. And we had a pond across the street. <SEP> And from little on. I'm. It's so different down here where you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something. When our kids were little you got them a pair of skates.
