. It's not often you get many women interested in football. <SEP> Do you follow football very much? I'm sorry what? Do you follow football very much? I don't. I haven't recently. <SEP> We can talk about something else. Do you have any. You married? I'm not. I guess kids are out. What's that? <SEP> Kids are out. Are you married? <SEP> I'm married. Got two boys. Do you like football? <SEP> I follow the Cowboys. But that's about it. The same here. Do you live in Dallas? <SEP> I am a pretty big Dallas fan been for a long time. But I haven't been to any games recently. But I try to catch the game every weekend that I can. <SEP> Have you ever been to a Cowboy's game? I haven't. It's pretty nice. We decided just to watch them at home. <SEP> But. That's good. At least you follow the game a little bit. <SEP> I'm not a fanatic about it. I don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are. I just like to watch. And hopefully they win. That's about the extent of it. Right now I'm in college. So I'm more into college football than professional I think. <SEP> I see. What school are you going to? I'm at B Y U. B Y U. So. <SEP> Leslie what are you studying? Nursing. Nursing. <SEP> My mom's an L V N. What are you planning to go into? Do you want to be an R N. Or. I haven't really picked a field. I've thought a lot about labor and delivery. But I don't know. <SEP> Try that. That's what my mom does labor and delivery. <SEP> She loves it. She really enjoys. Is she a nurse in Dallas? <SEP> She's a nurse in San Antonio. But she's been working on a late shift. She works I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it. <SEP> She works the graveyard shift. And she's worked that for years when I was small. I guess probably going on twenty years now. <SEP> And she really enjoys it. She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night. And she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives. And she's really enjoying herself. She really likes it. That's great. <SEP> Good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree. Hope you'll like it. <SEP> Do you plan on staying in the Dallas area? I'd like to come back to Dallas. Right now I'm in Utah of course. So. But my family's there. So. I'd like to go back. <SEP> I think Texas San Antonio in particular has got a large base of hospitals. I don't know about Dallas. I think Dallas is pretty scattered. Are you in San Antonio? I'm in Dallas. <SEP> But I'm originally from San Antonio. And they've got large medical center down there. They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also. <SEP> So if ever wanted pursue anything more than your nursing degree that'd be the place to do it. My brother-in-law is in the medical profession he's at medical school in San Antonio right now. <SEP>. Like I said good luck to you. <SEP> Take care. And maybe we'll meet up again some time.
