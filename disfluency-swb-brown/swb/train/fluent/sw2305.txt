. The first thing. What do you think you would offer as far as information about selecting a school? First I think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do. <SEP> Once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer. Do you feel that the. Depending upon the field I know there are some fields which a person should go to that school all four years. But I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary. A lot fields are. Most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway. It's your core education your general education requirements. <SEP> If they want to get a liberal arts degree I don't know what advice I'd give them. Go to the school you'd like to go to. That's what I did. <SEP> I didn't care about the program or anything else. I went where I wanted to go. What was your degree in? Political science. Political science. I know I'm going to school right now. And I have a friend. <SEP> Where are you at? U T D. University of Texas Dallas. I guess everybody's in Dallas that I talk to. I'm in North Carolina. I know. <SEP> That's where Texas Instruments is. Something that I think that I've noticed that. I have a friend. I think if you're going into law or medicine a very particular very specific field even engineering you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public institution. <SEP> And it's a lot cheaper. My parents made a mistake in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years. <SEP> And she found out after that. She said my parents they really wasted a lot of money. This is about twenty years ago. But right now I just. As far as selecting a school I feel that a lot of it depends upon the major. <SEP> It does. I didn't know what I wanted to do after I got my degree. Originally I had planned undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration. And I went ahead and pursued that. I got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it. I didn't want it. And from that point I went to law school. <SEP> And after a year and a half of that I decided I didn't want that either. Haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up. <SEP> But I really did enjoy the law. That's where I wanted to be. But I didn't want to go through the hassle that the law schools put you through because I never did want to be a practicing attorney. I just wanted a law degree. And I've since discovered that I would be far better off being in the paralegal field. Because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what I like. <SEP> And you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to. So that's what I'm pursuing right now. <SEP> And I'm pretty happy with it so far. I'm pursuing what's called an interdisciplinary field. I'm a speech therapy major. And fortunately I have a good medical background. <SEP> And. That's probably very useful. It's actually turning out to be more useful than what I thought. <SEP> And I also have a good languages background linguistics. And some psychology. It's all working together. <SEP> The only field I'm not familiar with really is education which requires about four or five different fields really. So it's a. <SEP> I thought at one time I wanted to be a teacher. But I quickly dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet. I said I couldn't do this everyday. <SEP>. Maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing. You are a disgruntled graduate student. <SEP> I am just a disgruntled person all around. I'm the original Mister Scrooge I guess. <SEP> I just. I think. There is. I think law would be a fine profession fine field to go into. I know one time I was in a political science class. And talking about fields people going into different fields I made an off the cuff remark about lawyers about their integrity being questionable. And that was like a can of worms. <SEP> You probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school. There was a woman. She said my best friends are lawyers and all this. And it was just. That remark in itself is a slam. My best friends are lawyers. I know. <SEP> My best friends are blacks. Or Jewish. It used to be Jewish. Jewish. Now blacks. <SEP> And I guess Iraqi now is the. I know. It's. But. Law was a lot of fun until you get to law school. <SEP> And it doesn't become fun anymore. I have a friend. She's going into law. Another friend going into law. And she's. I'm really concerned about. She's just going to be. What's going to happen when she gets there. You going. All of her dreams will be dispelled. <SEP> If you've ever seen the program PAPER CHASE it's very much like that except worse. I think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful. <SEP> It is. I see that happening. Very much so. <SEP> It's a lot of that. It was enjoyable for a while. But it's such a grind. <SEP> And you begin to wonder. If I'm not. You really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it. If you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it. <SEP> I wasted a year and a half of awfully hard. And I aged ten years. But I wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world. It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law. I went to a language school. And it was an United States institution. I was military at the time. And I think probably the biggest. <SEP> What branch were you in? What branch were you in? I was in the Air Force? <SEP> I was too. For myself I think that military experience was fine. I just wish that there was something else that I could have done with. I got tired of the service after a while. It. I had a terrific job really enjoyed it. What was your job? <SEP> Command post. I was a linguist. I was just wondering were you in SAC by any chance? <SEP> Were you in SAC? In Tak? SAC. I wasn't. <SEP> I thought maybe you might have had some experience with the R C one thirty-fives. I didn't go flight crew. Matter of fact I didn't make it completely through that field. I was in intelligence school and about three weeks short. I didn't make it. I sort of washed out. <SEP> After about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training it's something. <SEP> I think that's why children really need to think about the field they're going into and spend a lot of serious reading not just thinking about. <SEP> They actually should do some reading. That's right. And if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it. And they should study it. <SEP> I think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school. <SEP> They find out just how much of a people person they are. That's true. I found that out when I was in high school. I worked at McDonald's. And I tell you what. I worked at McDonald's as well. And I can tell you one thing. There are just some people that I. You just came to the point where. And I eventually worked as a lab technician. And I worked front desk. And somebody could walk in the door. And I knew exactly what they were going to do and say. <SEP> I was the same way too. I'm not a people person. I hate having to play such a nice guy. Especially when it's all phony. Especially when you got some jerk coming in. <SEP> I. It's just not for me. I deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why I'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot. <SEP> That's good. I was just wondering getting back to the school thing so I almost wish that there was something.
