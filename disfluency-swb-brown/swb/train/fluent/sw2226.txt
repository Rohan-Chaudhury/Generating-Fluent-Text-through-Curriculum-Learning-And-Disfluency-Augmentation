Books. Mainly I read the Bible these days. <SEP> That's very good. I do too. That's great to hear. And Christian literature. I've kind of. I used to read a lot of novels. But it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the Bible and you work and whatever that pretty well takes up your time for reading. <SEP> It does. It. And I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart. And he really has. It's getting to where a just really want to read it. <SEP> That's good. That's good. It's hard for me to find time also to read. A lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that because I don't have a lot of time. But when I do get to sit down and read I like to read the Bible. And I like to read. I read to my daughter a lot too. Do you? <SEP> And I like to read Bi-. I have Bible storybooks. So I like reading those to her. And she really enjoys those. So that's good. And it's kind of short because we don't have a lot of time to read. <SEP> So it's real enjoyable. For both of us. Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's? <SEP> Frank E. I guess I haven't. THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and I forget the other. He's also written a lot of children. How old is your daughter. Five. Five. He's written some children's books as well. And they're all spiritually oriented. <SEP>. What's his name again? Peretti. Frank E Peretti. <SEP> Frank E Peretti. P E R E T T I. I have to look for those. Do. Because I love to read his children's books just. <SEP> Just to read them. That's good. They're good. They're great. That's good. And it's usually about a family of archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like digging in old ruins and running across the old gods and things. <SEP>. <SEP> That sounds pretty neat. It is. It's real exciting. <SEP> I'll have to look for those. And it also teaches them spiritual warfare. So. <SEP> That's neat. I have a. My daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection. And I like that because it's real easy to follow for her. If I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd never understand any of it. It's hard for me. <SEP> That's right. It is real hard to follow and understand. <SEP> And I've got a Bible that has a little bit of a glossary in the back. And it helps explain who people are. That's about the hardest thing is who's related to who. I know it. And especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats. <SEP> It sure is. But it is good reading. And it's good for us and everything. That's right. <SEP> I really do enjoy it. But I also. But then on the other extreme I like to read horror Steven King type books. I've read a lot of his too. The. And I like that. That's good fun reading. Can't put them down. <SEP> You can't. You really can't. They are good. And they're just so suspenseful. I really do enjoy his. There's another guy. What can. What is his name. You would. When you're recording you can't remem-. <SEP> I know. Dean Kratz or Kranz. Or. Judith Krantz? Y-. Who? <SEP> Judith Krantz. I know her. It's a guy. And he writes the same thing though. It's that real gruesome horror stories. <SEP>. <SEP> That's good. Koontz. His last name ends in a Z I know that. I think I know who you're talking about. I've seen. I don't think I can pronounce it either. But. <SEP> I'm in a book club. And I think I've seen his books in there. I've never read any of his. But they're real. I kind of got burnt out on Steven King though. It seems like it's all the. <SEP> Did you ever read the. It's one of his first books THE STAND. That long thing. I know it. And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that. <SEP> They do kind of follow or Are similar. That. I love that book though. I thought it was great. <SEP> It really was. And I loved THE SHINING. That was my favorite. Those hedges when they started moving. <SEP> Whenever they made that into a movie I was thinking if they show that I'll just die. For some reason that scared me more than anything. <SEP> That is. He just brings stuff alive. You could just visualize everything. <SEP> That's. And that was a pretty scary movie too. I think they did a pretty good job. But they didn't follow it exactly. <SEP> But they did do it justice. That's right. But most of the time they don't follow books very well when they make them into movies. That's true. I liked IT as well. <SEP> That's another big fat one. I did too. <SEP> That was good. I also liked CUJO. Did you read that one? <SEP> And. Except it broke my heart. I'm a dog lover. <SEP> Me too. And then NIGHT STAND. Is that NIGHT. It was. <SEP> DEAD ZONE. That's one I liked. What? DEAD ZONE. <SEP> That was a. I've read that one too. That was a real good one. He's written a lot of books. <SEP> He just sits down eight hours a day. Just like any other job. I know it. <SEP> And then he has some under another name. That he's written. That's right. That one about the Gypsies or that hunger. <SEP> Or s-. I think his name was Bachman. He wrote under the name of Bachman. Richard Bachman. <SEP> He is really interesting. He's so prolific. I wish I could do that. I know it. And I have gone back. And after I graduated I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit too. <SEP> I do too. I love good old. Once you can get into the language. The l-. <SEP> It's like it's English. But it's not the same English they speak today. So it's kind of hard to keep at it. But. <SEP> That's true. But I. They're worthwhile. Literature? That was one of my favorite subjects in school was literature. <SEP> Me too. I used to love those good old books. <SEP> I didn't mind doing that at all. Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself. I liked. Why can't I think of their names. The one that wrote WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Wasn't that Jane Ehre? <SEP> That was another one. He wrote JANE EHRE too. You know who I'm talking about. <SEP> Those are good old books and classics. That's right. <SEP> Sure is neat. That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen because they'll take a classic and televise it put it into a viewing format more or less. <SEP>. <SEP> A lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays. I know it's really hard for me. I work two jobs and have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school myself. Do you? <SEP> So it's hard for me to sit down and read. I can imagine. But when I do I just love it. Me too. <SEP> I think we've accomplished five minutes. So. I think we have too. <SEP> Thank you very much. It's good talking to you. You too.
