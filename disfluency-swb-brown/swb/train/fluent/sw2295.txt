. On this subject I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet. But my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home. So I've always been involved in one. <SEP> How do you feel about them since you've kind of been close to that. I can kind of see both sides. I really can. Nursing homes to me. I would personally be the last resort if I had to put someone in there. <SEP> I've had a touch of experience. My dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him. If it's a have to thing. I. <SEP> And she put him in. But he wasn't there very long before he died. But I guess the one time that I saw him there as far as the surroundings that seemed okay. <SEP> But we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of keep him real out of it all the time. <SEP> And that's always kind of bothered me. I kind of think that's true too. Because it's so under staffed. That's like everything else though. <SEP> I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home. But I've never actually been there. And I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about. <SEP> But. But still I'm sure there are aspects to it that aren't really desirable. <SEP> I know. I've always. My sister's involved in one also. And I really think they really do a wonderful job. But still there's those little things that happens. <SEP> There really is which. I think it's a wonderful place if it comes to that if you just can't take care of them any more. Sometimes you don't have any other alternative. That's it. <SEP> Family's tied up with their own lives and things and usually working. Other things. <SEP> And it's hard to. But I think when the time comes I hope to have the time to really look around and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at. <SEP> I think that's important too. In fact there's a. I do too. <SEP> Outside's awful deceiving sometimes. <SEP> There's one close to where my mother is. But in order to get in you have to be able to walk in on your own. In other words you can't be in too bad a shape to start out with. <SEP> But then if you deteriorate they have a separate section for those who need care all the time. Ca-. <SEP> But it's always. And they have a long waiting list too. So there's always this feeling of you've got to be able to walk in the door. So you can't wait until you're too bad off. Off. But then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because you have to give up your automobile or whatever. To. <SEP> And everything you worked so hard for all your life. <SEP> And if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment. <SEP> So that's a hard one. But it is a very nice nursing home. There is some really nice ones. There's also some private ones. But of course I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that. <SEP> That's the problem. That's way out of my reach. The expense of it all is. And another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately. <SEP> But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care. The very same. <SEP> So I don't like that aspect. But I think there's ways around it though that. They could put it in one of their children's names or something. But still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that. It's their money. <SEP> That's right. That's how I feel about it anyway. I've talked to my mother about that several times lately. And I said I want you to have control of your own business. <SEP> But what if. My mother's seventy now. So naturally she's retired. But she's still on her own I mean. My mother's seventy-five and still has her own home and everything. I think that's wonderful. I really do. Just as long as they can. And then on the other hand I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy. <SEP> That's true. They have a lot of people around to do things with. They're not lonely. <SEP> Some of those places have wonderful activities and things lots of stuff going on. And they'll take them places. <SEP> I don't know. It's not all bad. But I guess once you get ill then you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things. Around. <SEP> But I really don't know what the other solution would be. I really don't. But. When the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents. <SEP> Really do. Because I have been raised in one. So there's lot of things I know to look for. And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either. <SEP> I really don't. That might be kind of tough. It really would. And like I said my sister's still in it. And I really don't think my mother'd want to be there either. <SEP> It's been nice talking to you. You too. And I guess we'd better get back to work. <SEP>.
