How many credit cards do you have? I think I'm down to one. I wish I was that way. Is that why you said I had more experience than you? <SEP> I was pulling your leg. How do you use your credit card? Do you just keep it in reserve. Or. I the way I'd like to try and use it is you make your purchases at prime buying time. <SEP> And then you pay that off and don't use it until it's paid off. That's my ideal way. How do you use it? <SEP> Emergencies come along. And I use it. That's understandable. <SEP> My car had a major problem and seven hundred dollars. And things just come up. <SEP> And you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to. Actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have. And I use them. My American Express I use for gas things like that. And I pay that off monthly. And then some other credit cards like store credit cards I do have them up there a little bit. But. I try not to use them too often. But living in this area I live fifteen miles west of Washington D C. <SEP> It's a very expensive area. So sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something. <SEP> I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards. And I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble. So we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it. <SEP> I just. That was good that you had the opportunity to do that. <SEP> Are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card. Or? <SEP> We pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there. <SEP> Our only credit card is Sears. And I have that for automotive purposes. That's great. Everyone I know here uses credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you. <SEP> It's just too easy basically just get yourself in trouble with those. The only other one I have. I have a Diner's Club through where I work. <SEP> I see. So that I use because I travel some. So I use that. And I don't really have to worry about that because I only use it for business. So I automatically have the money to pay it off. But. <SEP> I wouldn't mind getting back into one if they would. You start out at a low limit. And then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit. And if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that then that's fine. <SEP> But they eventually gets up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand. <SEP> Forget it. I don't want that. The temptation's too great. <SEP>. So I don't know. Just. Writing checks is just as easy I guess. That's true. That's true. So I guess we've kind of exhausted this topic. <SEP> What can you. You can't say too much about it really. Other than you use them or you don't use them. You like them. Or you don't like them. So. <SEP> I guess they don't care if we end it early. So hopefully you have a good Thanksgiving. That's coming up. And then maybe we'll talk again. You too. May be. You're the furthest person actually that I've talked. I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. <SEP>. Texas is the big one. So. <SEP> Then.
