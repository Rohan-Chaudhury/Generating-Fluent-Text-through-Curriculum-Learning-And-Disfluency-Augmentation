Did you hear our topic? It's in regards to discussing homes. Homes. Are you settled in a place? I'm settled in a place. I've been in it for actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy-eight. And it's in Richardson Texas which is north Dallas. <SEP>. And we've lived in two houses in Richardson. We moved here in seventy-four and changed locations in seventy-eight. <SEP> How about yourself? We left here in seventy-six. We were here for a few years. Then we have come back just this summer. Right now we're looking for housing somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area. Are you familiar with that? It's a nice area. <SEP> It is. The kids are in school here in Duncanville. We're in a temporary place right now. So they've enjoyed the school. So we're kind of trying to stay here. But. Are you finding it tough trying to find what you want. Or. The problem we got is that we've got five children. <SEP> And so we really want four or five bedroom house. And everybody says how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing. So we look at the paper. We talk to our realtor. And you can cut the listings in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms or five. <SEP> Are you looking. Or you settled. We're settled. And we're. Having. I'm probably older than you. I'm fifty-two. But anyway my youngest is getting married this year graduating college. <SEP> So I can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe. <SEP> That empty nest syndrome is going to set in I guess. So we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere. Closer to our families. <SEP> Are you from Florida originally? From West Virginia. But my wife's parents are from the New York New Jersey area. <SEP> But everyone has seem to relocated down that area. Seems like a nice place to go. <SEP> We've got five. And the oldest is ninth grade. And the youngest is second grade. And I think they're going to be with us forever. I don't know if that's true. But it's sure we're not anywhere near looking to cut down in size. We're trying to find. I understand. <SEP> You need very minimum four and probably five. <SEP> In fact six would be real good. My wife and I can share a bedroom. It's tough to find a five and six bedroom house isn't it? <SEP> Either. I don't think it's possible unless you multimillionaire something like that. I know. <SEP> Seems like you get in that category you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever. And that's an awful lot. <SEP> It is. We're having. Actually if we find something for less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right. <SEP> That's. But I think the thing's out there. It's just a matter of finding the right place. Just Matter of looking. <SEP> Lot of people in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do something. I had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school. And there were seven kids in her family. <SEP> And they converted the dining room and did this and that. But they always seemed to get along fine. <SEP> I think once we get into a place it will be just fine. But until then it's a little stressful just looking all the time and that sort of thing. I know. And there's nothing harder than that. I always just sort of assign my wife that chore. Then I would let her narrow it down to three or four. Then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do. <SEP> Maybe that's the case. At least she's got more opinions. Seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about. Openness the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore. <SEP> <SEP> I understand that. What kind of business are you in? <SEP> I'm in the sporting goods business. I'm a manufacturer's rep. I represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies. Who are you with? <SEP> We're with an organization called Wycliff Bible Translators. It's a missions organization and doing translation linguistics that sort of thing. <SEP> It's got an office down here near Duncanville. And we just moved down to be on staff down here. So. How was the. You say you lived in the Denver area before? How did that compare with this area as far as housing prices? <SEP> We were really surprised to find that they're higher here. No kidding. When we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding to find that prices were almost two or three times as high as we'd expected. And then to come down here we thought things would be lower. And they're not. I guess really prices for housing are just.
