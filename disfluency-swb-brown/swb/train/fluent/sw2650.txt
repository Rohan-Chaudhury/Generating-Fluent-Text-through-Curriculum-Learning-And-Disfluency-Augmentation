This is really ironic that I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away. And it's just been tearing me up all day. <SEP> I bet. Because we have just been looking all over for him. We've been to the pound. We've been to the humane society. We've been to the adoption center. We've just been all over the neighborhood. We've been calling neighbors. So this is just really strange. I guess so. Have you lost him before? This is the first time. He's gotten out before. But he's always stayed right here. <SEP> He's never gone away. And so this is just really strange because. What kind of a dog is he? He's part golden Lab and part Alaskan not Alaskan. I always forget. <SEP> Australian shepherd. And. <SEP> He's a big one. He's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me that he hasn't come back because like I said he's never gone away like this before. And I would think he could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big. But I don't know. <SEP> I hope he comes back. That's too bad. I do too. How long have you had him? About two years. So he's. <SEP> That's tough. It's really. You get very attached to animals don't you? Isn't that funny how we do? <SEP> We just really. They're always there for you. And they don't talk back to you. <SEP> And it's kind of pleasant. They're companions. Do you have any? <SEP> We have a dog a little white Lhasa. And her name is Angel. And we have a cat a white cat. He's just a Tabby just a. And his name is Dominique. We call him Neek. But. How do they get along together? <SEP> Pretty good. We had the dog first. And she's kind of a wimp. And the cat kind of rules. But she likes him all right. We had another cat about two years ago. It got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep. <SEP> And then we got this new cat. So. I have two children. And they really enjoy the animals. And then my mother who's very elderly lives with us. And she's really good friends with the dog. They're very good buddies. That's what are so neat about animals. Like I said they're really companions. And they're friends. <SEP> That's right. You can love them all you want. And they love you right back. And they don't. That's right. They don't care what you look like or what you act like. <SEP> They just love you unconditionally. I know. <SEP> It's wonderful. It's just so neat. It's. That's. I don't know. This is just so hard. I know it has to be. It's like I said we've had him for two years. And he's never. He's gotten out. But he's always been right there. He's never been gone at all. <SEP> He's just always been right there when he gets out. It's the first time he's ever been gone like this. <SEP> That's really too bad. That's awful. I just knew today that we looked at the pound and that we just went all over the place. And I knew we were going to find him. And when we didn't it was. So I don't know. I hope you'll find him. You most likely will. We keep. They told us at the Humane Society and the adoption center don't give up hope. And then not yet. <SEP> Have you put any posters up or anything like that? We were talking about that tonight since he just got out yesterday. We were just talking about that whether. We were trying to find some pictures of him recently. We've got so many when he was a puppy. But we just don't have a whole lot. We have him on film on the video camera. <SEP> But you can't put that on the. You sure can't. So I don't know. <SEP> We will put. Some posters and stuff up. That's good. And hopefully that will help maybe around the neighborhood. But we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood. So that helps too if they can keep. <SEP> They can keep their eyes open. So. That will help. I think that if somebody else picks him up. I think that if he gets out he'll come back. <SEP>. I really do because he knows exactly where he lives. So. He will. I bet he does. <SEP> I know that it's hard on you. I know that I'd be worried too. I know. It's just so ironic that this would happen. And I would get this kind of a call. Isn't it though? I know. <SEP> That's. It's very strange. But. I know sometimes our cat will stay out all night. And when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him that he's got in a fight or somebody's hit him. And if he doesn't come by mid morning then I really get scared. But he's always come back eventually. So. That's good. That's one thing about cats though. They're so small. <SEP> And they can get hurt a lot easier. They can get hurt a lot easier. <SEP> They can. So that would make you really tend to worry about them if they're not right there. <SEP>. But he's a real feisty guy. He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property. Is that right? <SEP> He's. Cats are really almost more territorial than dogs are. They just really do not want other animals on their property. They're very very. He just. Any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't jump at them or anything. But he'll sit. And he'll watch. And I think maybe he would if it came real close. But he's very protective of our property. That's really. I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them. So I never had them growing up. <SEP> So I never really had them around me. So I've never owned one since I. They're really a lot different than dogs because they're very independent. And he's very affectionate when he wants to be. But if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll either scratch you or run away. <SEP> But when he wants to be he's really affectionate. He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and snuggle up to you. But if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him. But dogs seem to be always in the mood. They're always right there and like you to pet them and loving. That's true. I like the way they come up. And they'll put their head underneath your hand. <SEP> That. And most dogs do that. They do. I don't know any that really don't. They know exactly how to get that attention. <SEP> They sure do. They just come up. And they put your. Or they'll rub their head against you. <SEP> Do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-. He's outside during the day. And then we get home at night we do bring him in. You have a fenced yard or. <SEP>. The backyard it's really big too for him to run in and stuff. That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out because he's had all this room to run in. But. <SEP> How did he get out? He dug a hole under the fence. He did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole. And we filled it back up put him back in there. <SEP> He did it again. So we chained him up. <SEP> But we really didn't want to keep him chained up because we feel like that's just too restricting for him. So we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it so that he couldn't get out. <SEP> He kind of ripped through the chicken wire. So I can't. I just have not. I don't understand because it's like he's got a good home. He's got. We have two kids that just love him a lot. <SEP> It's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out. We just couldn't. You know that animals are like that. They like to roam and investigate. And see what's going on. I guess that's. <SEP> I guess that's probably true. I don't think it's anything we did. Least I hope not. <SEP> I'm sure that I know. He really does have a good home. I think that's what really bothers me the most about it. It's like. <SEP> How are your kids handling it? I don't know if it's quite hit them. I have two girls. <SEP> And they just been real. I don't know. At first they seemed to be upset. But now it's if he doesn't come home can we get another dog. That sounds like kids. It's wait a minute. <SEP> Poor Buddy. I said he's only been gone a day. And you already want to replace him. What's his name. Did you call? Buddy. <SEP> Buddy? That's was our cat's name that died. Is that right? <SEP> We named him Buddy after Buddy Bell the Ranger baseball player that used to be here. And we used to. We were really into that when we got him going to the Ranger games. And we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason. <SEP> But Buddy after Buddy Bell. So. That's funny. But he was a good cat too. We miss him a lot. <SEP> And I feel real guilty because we had him for six years. And one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster. And he got it. And I just felt so bad. It's real contagious. And it's. And the vet said it runs rampant in this area. I didn't know that. <SEP> And if they don't have their booster any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically. They get it if the other cat has it. So. I had no idea. I did not know that. <SEP> It was. I just felt terrible. I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was. He was just getting real skinny.
