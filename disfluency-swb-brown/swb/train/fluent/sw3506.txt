Is it Stacy? Angie. Angie. I'm sorry. <SEP> If you were going to have a dinner party what would you make? Let's see. I like seafood. Let's see. Shrimp steamed shellfish with maybe herbs. Spicy lobster with lem- linguini. That sounds good. <SEP> What is the steamed shellfish you said? And what would that be like a clam or. <SEP>. I think hors d'oeuvres are good too. And that way you can have a variety. So if you have a a dinner party and you're going to serve seafood for supper what type of hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal? <SEP> Cheeses or fruits or vegetables or. Fresh vegetables would be good. Or just. Probably not nachos and dip? <SEP> And would it be appropriate to drink when you have the hors d'oeuvres? And then when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with seafood? <SEP> All these hard questions. What white wine? That would be my guess. <SEP> And then dessert. I'm not really a drinker. So I don't know a lot about that. Something sweet? <SEP> Chocolate something chocolate. You must like chocolate. Let's see. Usually when we have a dinner party I like to grill. <SEP> You do? So we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip some cheese. One of our favorites is to take some Philadelphia cream cheese. And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and wash them and cool them and then dump them in the sauce and then take crackers. <SEP> And then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese. And you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail. And then I like to barbecue steaks or pork chops. And then lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad. And then I don't know what we usually have for dessert. Cake sometimes. But that's what we would do for a dinner party I guess. <SEP> That sounds good too. But I guess when you talk about dinner party that's more for when friends come over. Traditional. <SEP> Traditional. I wouldn't be the big snotty kind. <SEP> I just really started learning about that. And I bought a Martha Stewart. I don't know if you've heard of her. <SEP> Her cookbook. And she talks about catering and goes into all that and the different types of parties different types of foods. Do you work in a setting where you are in the food business? My father owns a restaurant. Is it in Dallas? <SEP> It's just a cafe. So it's not really anything that I want to. It's not the same. It's in Lewisville. You graduated from which high school? <SEP> Trinity. Trinity. And that's a public school or private? That's public. I have to get to know this area a little better I guess. Is your father's cafe one that you could cater out of? <SEP> It's not. And he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably. <SEP> Let's see. What else for catering. Let's see. What about Hawaiian luau. That would be good. <SEP> Could have fruits and pineapple. Let's see. And you could actually go with a chicken if you wanted to. I think decorating your food is really.
