I guess. Which one have you got right now? Or. I. Couple of them. I at the moment use an A S T two eighty-six. And I got a leading edge. And I got a American one and had a I B M one. But. Just a couple. <SEP> What do you have? I've got an Omega. And I've got a generic four eighty-six machine. It's very very generic. <SEP> What did you do put it together? And upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled. And now it's a fast machine. That's. <SEP> That's all I got to say for it. What do you use it for? <SEP> What do you use it for? Work. I'm a contract programmer. What kind of programs do you. Anything. <SEP> Business programs. Or. I've done business programming scientific applications like petroleum science stuff and test equipment. And I did one that was the demonstration of a touch screen for a company that sells touch screens. It was kind of fun. <SEP> Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like attack simulators and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for. <SEP> That's. That sounds interesting. <SEP> Matter of fact I guess you get a lot of graphics in there. That's where the speed helps out. Unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty eighty-six. It's slow. <SEP> That will slow you up. <SEP> I do programming for C N C turret presses and cat cam system type things. And really need a faster system. I got a new line that I sell metal fabricating equipment and cat cam systems and tooling et cetera. <SEP> I know a guy that upgrades for a reasonable cost. Who is that? His name is T Q or something like that. And my notebook is somewhere around here. See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough. <SEP> I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one. He's up in. <SEP> That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them. They not only give me a demonstrator but the hardware as well as the software. And as they go to the next one I just keep the. That works. <SEP> That's why I have so many different levels of P C -s around at the moment. Here it is. A T S Computers. A T S? <SEP> And where are they at? Do you know where Custer is? He's south of Renner on Custer. <SEP> And there is a little bitty mall or strip kind of center. In Richardson there. <SEP> In Richardson? I know where you mean. There is a Mobil and all that kind of s- on that one corner. That's about Lookout there isn't it. It's just south of there. <SEP> It's a little place looks like a castle. Kind of little guy in there. He gives reasonable prices. <SEP> I traded my three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred. That's a good deal. It was pretty reasonable. <SEP> But he. And he does a good job. And he guarantees everything he sells. There is a lot. You ever go by Lucky Computer there? <SEP> I used to. When I was putting shop floor computers together for guys I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems. Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so. So I don't know where those guys are at these days. But I. They're up there in that mall. Just below Campbell. Or that strip center. <SEP>. They're still doing business. Big business apparently. <SEP> I tell you those prices have just unbelievably come down. I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in. It's like wow. That works. I'll go do that. <SEP> I. And that thing screams now. I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed the three eighty-six. <SEP> That wasn't alive for but maybe two years. I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the price difference is about ten dollars. Is that right? That's it? When it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks. <SEP> I'll be darned.
