This is easy for me since I. And me too because I eat out a lot. I travel. I do about forty percent of my time on the road. <SEP> So you eat all your meals out. I eat a lot of meals out. I'm also married. And my wife is an A one cook. But she enjoys eating out. So I have to share it with her. And actually it's very easy for me because I make it a practice when I am out. I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here. So I look for just about anything. And it's a lot of fun. I don't have to really worry too much about price considerations because I. <SEP> I was going to ask you could you go to nice places. And. And it's really great. I like different types of food. <SEP> What are the memorable places you've eaten? You name it. Let's see. You've got one down near Addison. There's two restaurants that I particularly like that every time I get into Texas or I get into Atlanta Georgia I make sure I go. And that's Houston's. Houston's. <SEP> It's a great place. It's great. There's a restaurant right outside of Reading Pennsylvania that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people. But it is fantastic. There's a restaurant in Panama City. Of course not too many people want to rush back to the country Panama. <SEP> Because I was thinking. I grew up in Panama City. This is the country Panama. I get it. <SEP> But I have gotten to quite a few. And I go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there. And I know the locations. And I know the places. But lot of times I don't remember the names. I'd have to go back through some expense reports. But particularly down in your area I'm looking for some more restaurants. So I don't know what's down there the ones out in Addison. <SEP> Do you like Mexican? Do you like Mexican food. Not particularly. <SEP> That's one of the few. Which one were you going to recommend? There's so many places here. It's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here. <SEP> But in the Addison about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area anyway. Now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi. I have a. <SEP> But it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas. And now there's one in Addison. Let. I'm writing it down. It's S F U Z I. <SEP> And it's in Addison. And it's a great place. Also a great place that they have Cajun food is Copelands. I've been there. Now I really like Copelands. I've been there. One down there is the I think it's an old schoolhouse. <SEP> The I know. I don't like that place. I like the food. But I don't care for the clowning around. When I went I thought the food was not good. <SEP> I've had. Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of. That's it. That's it. I've had excellent food there. <SEP> When I went I thought. The people drove me crazy first of all. <SEP> But then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was. That's great. Italian is fine. I make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there in Ad-. Do you like Southwestern? <SEP> Now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's as a matter of fact. <SEP> And it's great. They have I think. Sometimes I've been when I thought it wasn't as good. But I went there recently. And I thought this really is good. So that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill. <SEP> And. This is great. This is going to give me some more places to go. A whole new dining experience. <SEP> I guess our time's about up. So. They haven't beeped us have they? They don't always. <SEP> I thought sometimes they say this is three minutes or whatever. They've been doing that when the circuits are busy. <SEP> And other than that they leave you go about five minutes. And then that's about it. I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat. So. It was a pleasure talking to you. <SEP> Thanks for calling for helping us out. You bet. <SEP>.
