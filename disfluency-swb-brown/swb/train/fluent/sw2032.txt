We've got to talk about music. And do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind? <SEP> I guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because that's really when I grew up. Not a seventies baby. So that's really what I like better. Is that kind of music. Is it disco. Or is it like. <SEP> Not that kind of music. But. More like rock like Led Zepplin type. So they can get the Doors and Led Zepplin. <SEP> That's cool. And how about the Rolling Stones? <SEP> I went to their concert last year when they were here. That's when they toured. How about Pink Floyd? I like them. So then we got some same things. Because. <SEP> I just didn't know that much about music. And I wasn't sure what kind of music. It's very hard. Because in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen. I listen to heavy metal or classic rock. What kind of heavy metal are we talking about? What. We're talking about what they call hard rock. <SEP> Give me some examples. Like Bad Company. What. Bad Company's not bad. That's not. They're like A C D C. <SEP> A C D C. Why. Have you heard of them? And stuff like that. That's not really hard rock. <SEP> I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal. <SEP> I think when you say heavy metal I'm thinking about Cinderella. Cinderella is hard rock heavy metal. I don't really care for Cinderella. But I like A C D C's okay. But for example they have what. But other bands consider it really hard rock. It's like brash metal which all they do is they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar. And the guitar is set really low. <SEP> I don't really care for that too much I guess. And what happens is like everybody gets totally into the music. And then they start dancing around. And they just bump into each other. <SEP> They hit each other with their shoulders. And then you knock people down. And what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people. <SEP> Is that the kind of music that you like? I don't like that music. But that's what they do. That's what some people call really heavy metal. <SEP> And the difference between hard rock and heavy metal is the lyrics also. Really heavy metal is considered the words heavy metal. And you always thought about suicide. And killing people and stuff like that. And just hard rock has. They don't talk about that. They just talk about life in general. <SEP> Like Queen's Reich if you ever heard of them. Of course. <SEP> You're talking Queen. Is that what you said? I said Queen's Reich. But you got to like Queen also. <SEP> Because. Because Queen was real popular when I was growing up. Especially A Night At The Opera? Don't they have a. Let's see the one that they have the whole opera singing in the background. <SEP> Bohemian Rhapsody. That was great. I heard that the other day on the radio. And I pumped it up. <SEP> Because I just love that song. That was a real good one. But they had. That whole record was pretty good. But then they started going downhill like everybody else. <SEP> That's true. They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that. They're still around. They've got a new C D out. But I wouldn't buy it. Because what happens is the old whe-. I like the old Rolling Stones. I don't like the new stuff. Of the Stones? <SEP> I agree. That's the ne-. The older stuff is the best of it. The new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which I don't really care for today's rock and roll too much. For example I used to like old Phil Collins. <SEP> An old Genesis? Definitely. I agree. And then what happened was that Phil Collins said I can make money a lot of money doing this. And then he came out with his record No Jacket Required. <SEP> That was good. But it was on his way of going downhill. Because he said I can make a lot of money just singing alone. And then he came out with the Invisible Touch with Genesis. And that really. Now I hate Phil Collins. I can't stand him. Because I look at him. And I say you were singing at this time and with these people. And you were great. And now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you sing or what you record. It's still going to be a number one hit. And so that's what gets me mad. <SEP> But did you go see that new Doors movie? Not yet. I guess I've been kind of considering it. Have you seen it yet? I saw it when it opened. <SEP> Was it really good? It's like I was watching Siskel and Ebert those guys that criticize movies? <SEP> And they both loved the movie? They said the music's great. It took me back to the sixties and stuff like that. <SEP> And then one of them said everything is great. But I'm going to give it thumbs down. And they go. But why? Because the end is really depressing. And so. The movie is so well made. And the music that goes with it just picks you up. I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine. <SEP> So for me. So you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then. But you learn to. It's just that the sixties music's got a lot to say. <SEP> I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too. I was like. Seventies music disco I don't like disco. I've never liked disco. But I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants. <SEP> That's true. That's true. But I was more in the late seven-. I shou-. Mid to late seventies between seventy-five and seventy-nine was more my era. <SEP> Did you go to college? I'm going right now. That's cool. <SEP> But. I didn't go then. But I graduated high school in seventy-eight. So in seventy-eight rock was starting to get really heavy. And real I don't know. <SEP> Disco was pretty much dead by then. So that's what I mean. Disco wasn't really my time. They always say that the seventies was the lowest point in progression ever in history. So. <SEP> About music? About everything. So it's like nothing happened during the seventies. Everything happened during the sixties. The seventies I don't know what they're called. It's like. The eighties are called the progressive years or the technology years because of all the computers and stuff. <SEP> But the seventies got nothing. Nobody cared to name it. That's kind of funny. <SEP> You're right. I never thought of that. The disco years are gone. I know. Can you imagine a big picture of John Travolta what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER? Him just standing there. <SEP> That's a good example to look for in history. From now on we're going to go from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties. What happened in the middle? Don't worry. Don't worry. You're not missing anything. So. That's true. Except for Vietnam. And that's why everybody. <SEP> You know with. It's like they don't want to talk about that. So they just don't name it. I guess it was pretty bad times. That's very true. But. Let's see. We've been talking for seven minutes. So. <SEP> Good. I haven't even been keeping track. I'm going to leave you alone. What are you doing? Do you have a family? <SEP> I was kind of in the middle of supper. But it's not a big deal. I'm sorry. I just left it. It's okay. Because I didn't. Somebody tried to call me last night. But I didn't have my number yet. I just got it today. <SEP> And so it's okay. I told them I'd be available during this time. So. Then have fun doing this. It is not that bad. <SEP>.
