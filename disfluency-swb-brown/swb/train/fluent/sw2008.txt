Cynthia. What did you wear to work today? Let's see. What did I wear to work today? Actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse and flat shoes. So can you dress pretty casually? <SEP> On occasion. On occasion. I do vary. I wear suits. I wear skirts and sweaters. On occasion I can wear jeans. How about you? I run a business out of my home. <SEP> So I tend to get up in the morning put on sweats do whatever I want to do with the kids then whenever I have a meeting with a client I'll put a suit on. And then come home and get back into regular clothes again. <SEP>. <SEP> There's no real dress code where I work. You see people wearing all different attire. I don't like to wear heels that really tires me out. I work in a big building. So I predominantly wear flat shoes. In the winter I wear sweaters. In summer I like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that. I've recently tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that I can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot. <SEP>. That's helped me a lot with having. I can only have a limited wardrobe since I'm only working part-time right now. <SEP>. But still it gives it some variety. Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that. <SEP> Accessories. What about your casual wear? Do you like to wear jeans most of the time? <SEP> Mostly. At home I predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also. It's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so hot. <SEP> They're like Ber-. Dress shorts. They're black corduroy Bermuda shorts. <SEP> And sometimes I wear a blazer with them. And I get really a lot of compliments on them. Where I work is predominantly male. So they. Their attire is always the same. Suits or slacks jeans whatever. <SEP> But. But I'm really the only woman at work that does that. But seems to work for me. But. <SEP> In fact I just got a new outfit as a gift that. It's one of those skorts. Th-. It's shorts but it looks like a skirt. So I think that'll be good for work too. It'll be comfortable. <SEP>. So. I guess down here. We just recently moved to Texas. So my wardrobe has changed quite a bit. We moved from Colorado where. And I have a closet full of sweaters. <SEP> That. I live in Virginia. You live in Virginia now? <SEP> That's interesting. So I'm. Right now today was in about the fifties. <SEP> But I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses. I'd like to be able to wear those here. Today it's eighty-eight degrees. <SEP> Needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now. Today was definitely a shorts day around here. <SEP> We're still pretty much in winter as far as that goes here. This is pretty unseasonal. But at least we. It feels good. It gets. Everybody doesn't have cabin fever today. It's nice to get out and about. <SEP>. I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing. <SEP> Sounds good. It was nice talking to you. <SEP> It was nice talking to you also.
