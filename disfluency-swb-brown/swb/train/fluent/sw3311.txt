Let's see. How old are you Lisa? I'm twenty. <SEP> How old are you? I'm older. Older. <SEP> Older than you are. We are supposed to talk about places we like to go. So I'm going. And where are you calling from? I'm calling from Provo Utah. But I'm from Plano Texas. <SEP> You are from Plano. My sister lives in Plano. Her husband is the new Director of Admissions at University of Texas at Dallas. <SEP> So. My dad used to work at U T D also. Generally we just go on family vacations to Arizona. Where's your favorite place to go? My grandparents live there. That's generally our usual summer vacation. <SEP> Where in Arizona? Tempe. I've never been to Tempe. <SEP> That's where I'd like to go. What do you like about Tempe? Mainly just being with family is it. We just hang out. And my grandparents have a pool. So we go swimming. And. Pretty hot isn't it in the summer? But we keep cool just by going swimming. And it's fun to be with my cousins. They're up there also my grandparents and my cousins. <SEP> That's good. <SEP> Been to Hawaii? Have you? In fact I just got some reservations. I'm going to go for almost two weeks this winter. <SEP> It's the longest. Actually I lived there. So I was there longer. But two weeks is the longest vacation I'll have ever taken there. So I'm kind of looking forward to that one. Around Christmas time? <SEP> In March. We're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way. <SEP> So I think I would like to go to Arizona. I was in Phoenix in January last January. But it was rainy and icky. It was the coldest it's been there ever in January. I think. It's very cold. So do you travel a lot. <SEP> But I would like to go to Tempe. Or. Do we travel a lot? Some. I was a travel agent. <SEP> I have been up until just a few months ago. But I'm thinking of going back to work. So you know a lot of good vacation spots. <SEP> I know a lot of good places to go. But you definitely need to go to Hawaii. That's your favorite? It is my favorite. My husband hasn't been to Europe yet. And I'd like to take him there. But he's traveled all over the United States. And I haven't. I haven't been down south. I'd like to go to New Orleans. Have you been there? I haven't. Where do you live? <SEP> I live in Yakima Washington. So it's cold and rainy today. It's yucky. <SEP> But we've had some pretty nice weather. We played tennis outdoors until last week. So that's a pretty good deal. Do you go to school in Provo Utah? I do. <SEP> Do you use NuSkin skin care. They're located in Provo. I work for NuSkin. <SEP> Do you? I'm a NuSkin person. <SEP> I sell NuSkin too. I am my only b-. And best cus-. Not only and best. But I'm my best customer. <SEP> Since we're not supposed to talk about this though is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream? Do you know? I don't. Maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing I would use. <SEP> I have that too. I'm forty-two. I need something. I need more. Than the intensive eye? <SEP> I didn't know if there was anything else. And I use the Celltrex. <SEP> But. NuSkin is wonderful. I think it's a wonderful product. Do you use it? I do. We get free products every month. So. <SEP> That's great. Now I'm getting about sixty bucks a month free products. So. I've worked there about a year. <SEP> That's good. Are they good to work for? They're wonderful to work for. That's great. <SEP> So we're supposed to be talking about places to go. And you have not been to Europe. Do you go to school? Do you ski? I ski. I've. <SEP> Ski. You probably ski very well in Utah. I don't. Actually since I grew up in Texas I've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about. Five times each season. <SEP> Why did you move to Utah? You are going to school? At B Y U. I. Is that where B Y U is? <SEP> I know some people that went to B Y U. That's great. Pretty good. I do like to ski. Pretty down there. I said I do like to ski. <SEP> So where have you skied? And it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go. If you like that kind of thing. <SEP> You're a sophomore. Or junior? I am actually a junior. Beginning of my junior year. <SEP> You're a junior. Good for you. <SEP> What are you studying? Nursing. Good for you. You sound like a girl that has it together. <SEP> I would just encourage you to do a little traveling though before you get married. Because when you get married you won't have the money or the time. You think. I know. <SEP> So just. Don't be in any hurry. I'm not I'm not. You really should go to Europe. I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college. And that was just. I could have had that or a down payment on a new car. And I took the trip. And. And it was great? <SEP> I traveled with a group of sixteen other students. Actually there was two other graduating seniors besides myself. And we just had a ball. We stayed at. How long did you get to stay there? Six weeks. <SEP> It was wonderful. So you should think about doing something like that. I just had a friend that got back from Europe. And she was there all winter semester.
