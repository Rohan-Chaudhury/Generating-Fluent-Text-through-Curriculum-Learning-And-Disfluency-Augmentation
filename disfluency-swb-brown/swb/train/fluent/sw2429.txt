What would you have at a dinner party? Lately since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties. <SEP> But when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time. I have one recipe for a really good type of a meatball. It's called burgundy meatball. And it's made with red wine and. That sounds great. <SEP> It's really good. And you can make it ahead of time and then make the sauce when you're ready to serve it. That's one of my favorite things to serve. I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party. <SEP> But if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish. I guess being from that part of the country. Because crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish. But I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest. <SEP> But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like. Shrimp fettucini is real easy to make and everything. And it's usually well liked by people I guess. I'm just a seafood fan. So I think on the lines of. <SEP> How do you cook crawfish? In fact I just came back from the grocery store. And being in Texas we don't have too many people that eat crawfish. But they had live crawfish on sale. <SEP> You're not supposed to eat them dead. You eat them dead. But. <SEP> Don't buy them that way. Because if they are dead for too long. You can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out. And you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you. <SEP> I'll remember that. So if you ever go in a restaurant order crawfish. Every once in a while you'll see on-. It doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident. But if the tail is straight on it then don't eat it. But you just put lots of pepper. <SEP> And you just boil them. And they're absolutely wonderful. But they're a pain to peel for some people. Once you get used to it they're real easy. But if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot. When you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too? I think for a dinner party. I don't know. It depends. <SEP> My age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party they would shell their own. We'd just have crawfish and beer or something. But if it was more formal like if I was working environment then I would probably shell'em or at least disconnect them from the head. But There's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head. <SEP> Still have see that. So it would just depend. <SEP> That's the best part of the crawfish. Sucking the head. But I don't know. It just depends on what type it was I guess. But you can buy the crawfish shells already peeled'n everything. And usually you use those for frying or to put in salads or to make a sauce with or something like that. <SEP> But you can go ahead and buy'em cooked and shelled. And they're more expensive of course. But. Does it taste a lot like shrimp. It really does I like shrimp better. <SEP>. Just The crawfish it just has a taste of its own. It also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that. <SEP> But I think that. And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps. We have a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time. <SEP> And. That's what I need. That's what I wish I had. But in our family I am the one who cooks. And I really enjoy it. It's gotten a little more difficult with kids. But I really do enjoy cooking. And we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot. <SEP> And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me. <SEP> <SEP> and we. Was really a lot of fun. I bet. <SEP> And. That got pretty competitive as far as who could come up with the best recipe. <SEP> It did. We tried to be fancier or more courses than the other. <SEP> <SEP> That would be fun. <SEP> Or. It was a lot of fun. It something unique. And then we got into different themes whether it would be ethnic food Or sometimes it would be maybe an outdoor theme or elegant theme or. <SEP> It was a lot of fun. Sometimes it might be the candlelight. And sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something. That's right. <SEP> That's fun. <SEP> It was fun. And we threatened to make the other two make us dinner one time Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying. <SEP> That sounds right I'd take him up on that. I'm. <SEP> It does. Except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just to make sure that they didn't have to do it again. <SEP> I'd be. <SEP> Make hot dogs or some potato chips. <SEP> That's about how much I can cook. I'm doing a lot more cooking now than I used to. <SEP> But that's only because my mom just started working. So she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon. So I try to have things cooked for her. But I usually try to stay out of kitchen. That's nice. I don't know. <SEP> Not one of my favorite hobbies. <SEP> It can be fun if you have the time. But a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it able to. My grandma speaking of those meatballs again she owned every Christmas and Easter. <SEP> Whenever we have the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce. And it has. I don't know. They are just kind of quarter size meatballs. And they are absolutely delicious. I don't know what she calls them in. I'm sure she puts wine in it because she cooks everything with alcohol. But. <SEP> I don't know. I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around. <SEP> It's in the other room. I don't know if we have enough time for it. It's real easy. One of the unique things in this it's a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs an egg whatever seasonings. You can just light. <SEP> So salt and pepper and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different. That would be wonderful. <SEP> Makes them a little bit crunchy. You need to chop em up real fine. But it makes them crunchy. And that adds something new to it. And then the sauce is just made with bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and cornstarch instead of flour. <SEP> So it's not a thick rich type of a sauce. It's more of a. When you use corn starch in gravy when you have Chinese food That kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that They use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies. <SEP> And it gives it a bit of a different consistency. How long do you cook the meatballs. The meatballs after you form them fry them in a pan until they're browned on all sides. <SEP> And then drain off all the grease. Then what I usually do is I freeze them. And then when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it. <SEP> Probably you have to heat it up for a good. If they're frozen it may take a half for them to thaw out. But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself. Let them simmer in the sauce itself. <SEP> And it's real good. That sounds great. Especially the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so far in advance. If you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend. <SEP> And then freeze them. That would be great. I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I hope to have lots of dinner parties Cause I like to. <SEP> I'm sure that I'll be involved in a big company. And I know that my future husband will be. He's going to be working for Chevron in Houston. <SEP> So he's going to be. I'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy. You'll meet friends. <SEP> Invite the boss over and friends at work. I have to impress the boss and clients cause I'm in public relations in school. <SEP> <SEP> So my whole job's going to be based on my clients'n stuff like that. So I'm going to have lots of dinner parties. And have to take'em out to eat. Right now I'm taking a class on ettiquesy. And all the little bitty things that I didn't even know. <SEP> I thought for sure I'd been raised properly. <SEP> But I've been doing a lot of things wrong I didn't know about. So Is there anything else. <SEP> I think we've covered the subject. I got some interesting information about crawfish. I was in fact. It's good cause I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale. <SEP> You need to try em. They're wonderful. I will. I'm sure my husband will be surprised'cause we were talking about them the other day before.
