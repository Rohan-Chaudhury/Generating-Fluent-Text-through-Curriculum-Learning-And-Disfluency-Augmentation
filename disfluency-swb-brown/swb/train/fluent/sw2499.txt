. What have you seen? The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES. <SEP> That's. I knew you were going to say that. I want to go see that. I just finally ended up going to see it. And one day my husband had the kids. And I just went because we could never get to go see it together because it's so long. By the time we had a babysitter for that long. <SEP> So I finally just went to see it. And I just thought it was fantastic. I watched Costner on the Academy Awards. I was really happy that he got. I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor. <SEP> But he did pretty good on that one. That was quite a. The buffalo scene in that thing was so real. It's like. It just blew me away. <SEP> I bet. There're several of them that are out right now that I want to see. DANCES. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. <SEP> I'm afraid to go see that one. That one looks so scary just from the previews. I thought I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months. <SEP> It's supposed to be good though. That's what people said. I know some friends who went to see it. <SEP> They said it was really riveting. That's what they said about THE EXORCIST. It's terrible. You'll have nightmares. I watched last weekend. Me and my roommate. We laughed about it. You're not a thirteen year old. I don't know. I saw it when I was a kid. And I thought. <SEP> I'll tell. I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie. And the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was. <SEP> He's a very good writer. And he had a way of putting you in that scene. It was. And of course I was living alone at the time. And it was late at night and scary and. You start hearing noises. Call the crisis line. <SEP> I bet. And there's rats in the attic. <SEP> Let's see. There was a couple of others that are out. And I can't remember. I saw one I thought was crummy. With that new Michael J Fox movie THE HARD WAY. Where he plays a actor that's th-. <SEP> I didn't even like the previews on that. I know. It was. I ended up at the theater. And there didn't seem to be anything else on I wanted to see. So I'll try that. But it wasn't worth anything. I didn't care for that at all. <SEP> I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway. The last two I saw him in one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE PART THREE deals. That was crummy also. I didn't think that was any good. <SEP> So. I saw the original BACK TO THE FUTURE. And then I know. I hardly ever go see a sequel. <SEP> I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better. <SEP> TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book. I hadn't read it. And I couldn't figure what was going on half the time. So. Nobody could figure it out. The book was so much. <SEP> There's just things. All you can do is put it in words. You can't put it in pictures. A lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you say what is this? <SEP> What's the significance of the apes. I should probably go back and read the book now that I just saw the movie again not too long ago. The book is really good. I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again. And that's one of them. <SEP> It's so well written. I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids. OTIS AND MILO. You're right. I haven't. That is the most precious movie. It has to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life. And it's all this. It's the story of this little cat and dog. And it's not cutesy. It's just so realistic. Everything they do. You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things. <SEP> Those. And it was A real dog and cat. A real dog and cat? <SEP> And all the other animals. They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised. And then the cat gets on this treacherous journey. He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river. And he winds up all over creation. I don't know where in the world it is. Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed. But it's just really an incredible thing. <SEP> Sounds sort of like the incredible journey. It was pretty wild. And. Of course the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it. But there's nothing else to keep it going. But it really keeps me going. <SEP> I've seen it twice now. That sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film. <SEP> Sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film. It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones. Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years. Not anymore. I was raised on Walt Disney films. <SEP> OLD YELLER. BIG RED. All those old good ones that you wish they had on more now. But. <SEP> When I was a little kid I saw the INCREDIBLE JOURNEY on Christmas Eve. And it was so good that I had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve. <SEP> That's something for a kid. That's pretty good. <SEP> And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time I'll tell you. Let's see. What are some other ones I've seen lately. I'm trying to remember. I can't. I just saw one on the video. Have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY PART TWO? That is a riot. <SEP> Is it? The first one was really good. But the second one is really good too. I was really surprised. <SEP> I didn't much care for the first one. Maybe that's. I thought it was funny. But that's my sense of humor. I'll have to go get that one I guess. It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore. And I guess I'm just middle America or something. I just go to be entertained. And and not really interested in the TERMINATOR or some of the Schwarzenegger stuff. <SEP> It's it's. I just. I get so tired of these sequels. Number nine number ten number fourteen. <SEP> FREDDY'S REVENGE PART TWENTY-FIVE or whatever. I've never. <SEP> FREDDY EATS A NUCLEAR WARHEAD. I'm just. I'm so sick and tired of that. I just can't believe it. It's like ROCKY films. I haven't seen a one. I've never seen any of those. <SEP> I can't stand Stallone. I can't either. He seems so macho I just. And I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do. Go into fourteen hundred episodes. <SEP> I hardly ever watch T V. If I ever get the hankering to see something I've got maybe about thirty or forty movies. And I just. When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can. <SEP> I don't even rent them. You don't? I figure if I find a movie I like I'll buy it. Cause I just watch them over and over again. That's like. My husband does that. He can watch them over and over. <SEP> I. And I'm. There's very few I would want to see that many times. So once he has one he likes to watch it over and over. My very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is EXCALIBUR. That was a good one. I haven't seen that one in a long time. <SEP> I loved that film. It's just so well done. And I lived over in England for four years. <SEP> That was the first place I ever saw it. And it was just. It was so good. <SEP> It was filmed in Ireland. And they got pretty scenery in Ireland. I bet. <SEP> It's nice. And I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was. So that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that. <SEP> It was unimpressive to look at. The whole thing was about the size of a medium house. It wasn't. When I was in England years ago. And I went to Shakespeare's and Stratford-On-Avon and all that. And it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it. Because it was so short. <SEP> The ceilings were so short. But. <SEP> There's some nice stuff over there to see. I spent four years traveling around and didn't see hardly anything. I just. <SEP> I need to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel. Go around all the places. <SEP> Stonehenge of course. Everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge. Big deal. Here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field. It's boring. Did you see any movies over there? <SEP> I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out. It came out right around the time with Sophia Loren. And that was a riot to see that. You know something. Come to think of it I don't think I went to the movies one time. Cause when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie. <SEP> I. Where I lived. It was a little town called Newmarket. About seventy miles north of London. <SEP> And there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us. And they had a little theater company there. And we use to go out to that about once a week. <SEP> A really nice place. Amateurs but really quite good. But that was interesting. Course go to London quite a lot and see shows down there. That sounds great. <SEP> But other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies. <SEP> Never sho- anyway anything that I ever wanted. I rented a lot of videos. Cause the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds. And who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies. <SEP> Probably some of them did. A lot of people did. <SEP> But it would have to be a good show. It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore. Because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by. <SEP> I us-. They have all these neat phrases. Like critically acclaimed. <SEP> That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award. I see. They can't. It's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're two miles away from water. <SEP> From Love Canal. Water view. <SEP> Waterfront property here at Love Canal. But critically acclaimed. Give me a break. <SEP> That's wh-. There's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies. And primarily I'm probably going to upset you. But people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me.
