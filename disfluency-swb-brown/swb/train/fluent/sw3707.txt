We have a Sheltie Collie a miniature Sheltie. Do you? It's about six months old. And we're try-. We live in an apartment. So we don't have a yard. So it has to stay inside. And we're having a difficult time trying to train it. <SEP> How old is it? It's about six months. You're in the roughest stages of pet ownership I think. <SEP> But they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs. But I guess every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because this one it. I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the training bit. <SEP> I've had dogs through the years. Right now I've got two and three cats. And my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix. And we watched it this summer for two to three months. And it wasn't trained quite fully either. But it was a sweet and an intelligent dog. How do you. What's the best method? <SEP> I don't know. I'm old fashioned. And when I got my dogs when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside. They say that's not the way to do it now. <SEP> You're just supposed to. Stand outside with them until they. Just put them outside. Unless you catch them in the act. We're hardly ever at home. So it's kind of difficult. <SEP> And you don't want to spank it or scare it or anything like that. So. You don't want to do that. But. We try to take it. It gets frustrating when you take it outside. And then it runs right inside. <SEP> Does it just want to sniff around? And it does it? Does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside? A lot of times. And it won't it's little job outside. <SEP> And it comes inside. Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside? We've tried that. And there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go. <SEP> And he chews on plants and all that. But that's natural for a little puppy? That's nothing. <SEP> It'll catch on pretty soon I'll bet you. I have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever. And she's gone the other way. Because she's so old she doesn't have much control. So we're battling with that problem. That's sad. <SEP> And she still feels good. She can't hear worth a darn or see very well. But she's got a great appetite. And she knows we're there by smell. How old is it? <SEP> She'll be sixteen in May. That's sad. And. <SEP> But we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years. Of course not. So we're putting up with all her accidents. I couldn't. <SEP> And the la-. Two nights ago she had diarrhea. And so that was a bad one. But I think we're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend. That is really sad. What's the deal. We're trying to take it on walks now. And we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash. <SEP> And so this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to tug on it to walk it. It just goes like a mad dog. It just jumps up and down and starts yapping. And it's not even close to even being trained on a leash. Does it. <SEP> Maybe you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes. We've heard some bad things about some of those. They sometimes misuse their license or whatever. <SEP> They treat them bad. We went to the junior college Richland. <SEP> And we took. My daughter was living at home then. And she took the Norwegian Elk Hound over there. And it's a pretty good class. And they did pretty good except this dog is. She's just pretty. She's not smart. <SEP> So she didn't learn a lot. But I think it calmed her down a little bit. And she's used to being around other dogs now. How long did it take? I think it was a six week program. Every what? <SEP> I think it was one night a week for six weeks. And it was a group class outside. It was fairly reasonable too. Sheltie Collies are timid. And they don't really. Unless they get used to something they're really nervous. And. <SEP> They're usually a high-strung dog aren't they? And if they're not accustomed to something they're really scared. <SEP> Our friend has a.
