Do you own a P C? I don't. I have one at. The company I work for furnishes. So I can work at home. <SEP> And it's just an old compact that is super slow. But it does its job. So. What processor does it have in it? I don't know. It's so old. It's one of. What kind of work do you do on it? <SEP> I do television ratings. And I process some ratings and do graphics for their television stations their clients. So. <SEP> It's basically just data entry and running some software. So it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated. I don't own a P C. But I work for T I. And. My husband does too. So. I have a fairly fancy one. It's a T I model. It's an S P one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty-six. <SEP> And I. The job that I do. I do a lot of training of our customers for new products. And I have to develop functional specs and desk top publishing and everything. So it's kind of fun. <SEP>. I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house. But I just haven't got around to doing it yet. <SEP> I'd like to have one for the house too. But sometimes my husband says usually I work on the computer all day at work. I don't want to come home and have to work on one too. Your husband what group is your husband in? Something with the defense. <SEP> Defense systems and electronics group? Something like that. They've changed their name so many times I've lost track. So. I see. <SEP> He works up in Plano. I work on printers and the peripheral products division basically. <SEP> I work in the airline marketing group. So we do a lot of. <SEP> I didn't even know they had anything like that. There's so. They're. I learned so many things that they do. They're into so many different things. So. <SEP> I just kind of. In for a while. He had one of those top secret things where he couldn't talk about what he did so. For a while. <SEP> But then he switched jobs. I don't understand half the stuff he does. And I have. Is he a programmer? I see. <SEP> Software design engineer as they call it. So. But I have a degree in information management which is computer. <SEP> It's basically more the business end of it than the programming end of it. But I've been at it for five years. So. Everything's changed so much I probably couldn't even get a job right now. It seems like it's changed so much. So they've made such advances in computers. So. So does your husband ever use a laptop or a notebook? Does he bring a little one home with him. Or. <SEP> Sometimes he brought home a portable one. But it quit working. So he brought it back. And he just hasn't brought another one home. But they did give him a new computer at work. So. I see. We build laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also. <SEP> And those are really handy. They have modems in them you can send a fax from your P C. How nice. But they're really. <SEP> He doesn't have one of those. So. What's that? He doesn't have one of those. They're pretty handy because when I travel it's easy to check messages. Just plug in the phone to your computer and dial in. <SEP> And. My husband doesn't have to travel. So. I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again. <SEP> At least you get to. So that kind of reeks havoc with plans. But it's really not enough to become a big hassle. <SEP> That's good. Some people enjoy the travel. But I don't think I'd like it if he traveled a lot. I see. I would love to have a computer. They. But they're so expensive. I don't know. There you can get. Depends on what you consider expensive. <SEP> You can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars where just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars. I guess it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be. But it's a lot to put into one. It's still. Two thousand dollars isn't just pocket change to a lot of people. <SEP> That's right. It's not. It's not pocket change. So it's major. Maybe when the kids get in school that will be. When they start needing something then that will be different. But. When I started at T I I was a Summer development student and finishing up at school. And so those papers really. It was nice having access to the equipment to. <SEP> I remember that. I had to do some of my husband's papers because I had access to one. But his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing. So. <SEP> I did a lot of his papers. They come in real handy. That was a lifesaver. How many different types of packages do you use? At home? <SEP> All I. The packages I don't really use. What I use that outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that I use. I've got. Up at work anyway I use WordPerfect and Lotus and which is a line-draw package. I know those two. <SEP> I've just used WordPerfect and Lotus the most. You probably use or something like that for your data entry stuff that you're talking about. <SEP> A lot of the data entry stuff they used uh survey system and just in-house programs to do what they needed. I work. Do you work at home all the time. Or just. <SEP> I worked for this company before I had my first daughter. And they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things. So. That worked out pretty good then. <SEP> It did. I really don't do a lot of what I used to do. I just do something really minor. But it's something that nobody else wants to do. <SEP> And it's time consuming. So. So it keeps you in the company? That's right. It gives me a paycheck. The work. Goes for three to four weeks three times a year. <SEP> It's not something that's continual because the television ratings don't come out all the time. They only come out four times a year. But. I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here I'd get all kinds of stuff done. Phone's always ringing. And people always asking me to do something else. <SEP>. I've got a lot of. Especially right now we've got several new products coming out. And I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise. <SEP> Will they let you take a computer home to work? But I need to be at the office too. I've just got to deal with all those other things that happen. But a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off. <SEP> I bet. My hu- he took one home when they had a big deadline coming up. And it was looking a little touchy to meet. So. I've done that before a couple times. <SEP> But that would make it just that much easier. Instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks. That's right. I thought that would be. Because it's real nice with this because I don't even have to go into the office. I've maybe been into the office once in the past three years. <SEP> They just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever. So. That sounds really nice. It is real nice. I just deal with them on the telephone. Half the people don't even know who they're talking to. <SEP> But I worked. I know most of them. I can't say that. A lot of people changed around there. But most people know who I am. But I don't know who they are. A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice. I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as well. <SEP> You just know them by the telephone. But it's been good talking to you. I think we've got the subject. We sort of stayed to the topic anyway. We tried. It's hard to sometimes. We'll talk to you later. <SEP>.
