Lynn. Do you have any pets? <SEP> I have a dog and cat now. What are their names? Tibby and Liberty. Which is the dog and which is the cat? <SEP> Tibby is the dog. And Liberty is the cat. Wife and I we have two cats. One's real nice. But the other one is a. She's pretty wild. <SEP> Ours are pretty calm. Are they just house pets? That's what ours are too. <SEP> Our cat we got from the pound the night she was going to be put to sleep. So that's why we call her Liberty. That's a nice story. <SEP> Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had? I've had a skunk. <SEP> I've had a Burmese python. I've had rats. I've had mice. Let's see. I've had gerbils. I had a son that was an animal lover. <SEP> So at one point I had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house. The skunk was it kind of like a cat to have around the house? <SEP> It was litter trained. <SEP> And we had it perfumed. And it was very aggressive. <SEP> But all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house. And the skunk. And the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa. <SEP> Nobody came near it when he was there. I had a dog one time. And he chased after a skunk and got sprayed. <SEP> So we had to give him a tomato juice bath and get him cleaned up. Ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them. But the glands had been removed. <SEP> But I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to back up and get ready. <SEP> One other question we had is Why do you have pets? Why I don't know. I think they're kind of nice to have. They're kind of just relaxing to pet and to. I don't know. When they sit up on your lap and stuff like that just kind of enjoyable to have. I don't know. Something giving you some affection as well. I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog. What do you think? <SEP>. That'd be the best way to be. Do you like big dogs or little dogs? <SEP> We had a German Shepherd. And he had dysplasia. <SEP> And he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went. So when he died we got a little one. <SEP> But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old. And it just was almost cruel because. Almost cruel for him to walk. <SEP> He couldn't get up. He couldn't walk. He was a hundred and twenty pounds. So it was a chore. So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry. <SEP> And then we've had three cats in our married life. And we've got a calico now. We've got a calico cat too. <SEP> Do you? She's the nice one. We used to live in an apartment. And our cats never went outside. But the neighbors used to let their dogs out. And our neighbors were kind of slimy. And our cats wound up getting fleas from the apartment that we were in. So we had to flea bath them. And it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all. <SEP> Don't even talk to me. When I was single I had gone away for the weekend. And my husband then fiance was to keep my cat. And he let her out. And my house was loaded with fleas. You walked in. And your legs were just black. <SEP> And we had such a time and never got the cat back. I found it in the street. <SEP> I was a social worker at the time and found it.
