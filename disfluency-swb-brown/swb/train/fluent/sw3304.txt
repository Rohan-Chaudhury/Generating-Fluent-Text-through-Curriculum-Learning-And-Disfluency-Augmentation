I guess we're recorded. What. Do you have any hobbies that you like to do? <SEP> Cycling computers backpacking just about everything. I generically have millions of hobbies. That's an interesting assortment. <SEP> My husband is into cycling. In fact he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the time. <SEP> I'm not quite that bad. I'm just a weekend cyclist. Do you do any handicraft type things I think was the question. <SEP> Handicraft type things. Whittling or. Just whittle away my life. I c-. Nothing like that. <SEP> I do some things. I've gotten into. I like to decorate things. And I do sweatshirts and T-shirts. And I've gotten to where I have started selling them at craft shows and things. That's pretty good. And I have done fairly well at them. I've had. A few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed. But most of them have worked out pretty good. <SEP> They. My only craft work is kind of like computers and go off to the little computer club meetings. And it's kind of nice because I've made money at it too. Considering I work for it a living. But I've got a couple of articles published. <SEP> It's kind of neat. What does a computer club do. I didn't know there were such things. Just all over the place. They just get around and talk techy or else. Half the members are really expert. And the other half are really not. <SEP> And we kind of help out the people who are really not. You're not into hacking or whatever. <SEP> I think I'm a hacker. But I'm not the dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers. That's one of those sports I don't go for. That's kind of interesting hobby. What else did you. You said you did cycling? <SEP> What was the other thing? Backpacking. Backpacking. We. <SEP> I belong to a Boy Scout troop. It beats paying United Way. I just donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun. We have done that. Our two older boys were in Boy Scouts. And my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago. <SEP> So we've done a fair amount of that in our spare time also. But it. I. That's a great thing to do really. Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting? <SEP> Just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest which is kind of out in east Texas. <SEP> And we go to places out in. Let's see. What's that state north of us. That state. That one. That one. That one. <SEP> And. To the. By Fort Sill there? To a old Indian fort that's out there. Trying to think of the name of it. No memory. <SEP> Have you gone to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts? I missed out this last year. I wasn't able to get the time off but maybe next year. It's a good possibility. I've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do. <SEP> When I was a kid we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras. That was loads of fun. Does your whole family like to do it. For a vacation you'd go backpacking? Not quite because I'm not a whole family. I'm just me. You just. And you volunteer for the Boy Scouts? <SEP> I rent my kids. Sometimes. It's better than owning on them and making payments on them and things like that. <SEP> Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea. Have. You said you did it in the High Sierras. Do you ever just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack? <SEP> Not recently because the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go once a month. Someplace. But there's some stuff that I want to do with Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that. They have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go. <SEP> Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you which seems just a tad more relaxing. I. Probably. Probably. That's. My other things that I like to do in my spare time I like swimming. <SEP> Which is in now. I've done that. And I also. When I like something I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it.
