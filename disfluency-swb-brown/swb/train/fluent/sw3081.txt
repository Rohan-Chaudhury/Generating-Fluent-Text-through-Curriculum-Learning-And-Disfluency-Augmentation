I guess if I was having a dinner party depending on the number of people I might cook a brisket or a roast or maybe a chicken dish. And I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a potato dish. And we usually serve fresh fruit and then make a dessert. <SEP> That sounds good. So that makes. We're not real wealthy at the moment. Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna. And I used my mother's recipe. I really like it. It's got. You cook the noodles and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it. And I'm not sure she even puts. Must be some Italian spices in there. I can't remember. But for the cheese part you mix sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and layer all that. That sounds good. <SEP> It's good. That sounds good. And then tossed salad and. Diane get down from there. And let's see. What else did I serve with that. Bread do you have bread to go with it? <SEP> Corn. I made French bread with that one too. I have a recipe that's pretty good for that. So. Lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds. <SEP> I've heard a lot of people say the short cut on the cooking for lasagna. They've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna. I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna. <SEP> In fact I think I had it at a party once. Did you? It was good. I know people that have served it. And they say if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy. <SEP> Easy. And they said it's good. So that always sounds good to me. <SEP> I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot. I know. Seems like I cook a lot of dinners not always for company just for family. <SEP> So feels like I'm often in the kitchen. Not my favorite place but. A necessity. But a time consuming place. <SEP> So. Let's see. What else do we like to have for. Trying to think what else I like to serve. My mother likes to serve taco grandes. Have you ever had that? I don't know. <SEP> What that is. I don't know what that is. You take a flour tortilla. And you fry it like a taco shell. <SEP> And you. For all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some tomato sauce in it. And I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor. So you don't have to mess with spices and stuff. <SEP> And then let's see. And you heat up refried beans. And you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese. And what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first. Then you put the meat. Then you put the grated cheese. And then you put. Let's see what's next. Then I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the lettuce. And you can put guacamole and. Katy I'm on the phone. Get a towel or go change. I'm on the phone. A little sour cream is good and chopped olives. <SEP> Do you like to make your own guacamole? We don't make it very often I guess. But. <SEP> I don't very often. Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain. Do they? <SEP> I just cut slices off. And. I like an avocado sandwich too. That's good. That's good. Or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich. <SEP> I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day. And everyone there said they never made guacamole salad. What you want. Where do they get it? I don't know. I guess they don't have it at home. <SEP> I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to. I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe. They just said they never had it at home. So I was concerned that taking this as a dip I thought sometimes when we have it at home it turns dark on the top so quickly. So I just. <SEP> It helps if you leave the pit in it. Does that help? If you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it. <SEP> That's supposed to help keep it from turning brown so quick. I'll have to remember that. That day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top. And it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would. So. <SEP> That's good. I thought maybe that was the trick. That probably helps too. So. I guess we bought a lot of. We've been buying turkey lately instead of beef. So. <SEP> Do you want it? Even though. We have too. The ground turkey the meat is softer. And I. Everybody seems to like it. <SEP> Do you want scrambled? So. Sometimes it seems to be cheaper too. So we often buy it. <SEP> We buy it. If you get it on sale. So we bought that. Or we bought the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets. And I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them. <SEP> Or in. <SEP> I don't think mine know either. In fact we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey too. It costs less than the other. I don't know. There's supposed to be something more healthy about it. Poultry instead of the beef and pork. Less cholesterol. <SEP>. I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight. I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve. I always like dessert. <SEP> One salad that we always like my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a. I don't know what you call it. You mix cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of Cool Whip. That's good and quick and easy. That's always good. <SEP> Probably the only family recipe that we make is cheese cake. And we take a recipe from my grandmother. It's probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a.
