I grew up out in the country and was used to having guns around the place. And I'm not for gun control in the strictest sense of the word. <SEP> I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself. <SEP> I have quite a collection myself. And I'm a good hunter. And I started hunting when I was twelve years old. Of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes. And I don't want to see them ban guns completely. But I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either. So. I feel that its. I think the what was National Rifle Association had this bumper sticker a few years back about if you outlaw guns. Only outlaws will have guns then. <SEP> I believe that. And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun a knife a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with. <SEP>. And it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns. We can handle it. But there's an element that can't. <SEP> And it's got to the point now where even our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons. Because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them. They have got them outgunned. You know. So. There was an article in the paper just this week where one of the gun companies was developing a ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I which would give them additional firepower. <SEP> It held a fifteen shot clip they would be able to put down anything that came at them. <SEP> That would be. But you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun a thirty-eight. That's. Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good. <SEP> It's sure not. I have lived in Illinois at one time. And they passed a it wasn't really gun control. But it was you had to register as a gun owner. You didn't have to list your guns. But you had to have this card. It was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition. <SEP> And that was the first. This was twenty years ago. But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect. <SEP> In California they make you register when you buy ammunition. <SEP> You have to sign a. They take your name and driver's license number hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition. Especially for handguns. <SEP> Rifles aren't too bad. But any kind of handgun at all and a rifle you would still have to buy it or sign up for it. <SEP> So. We lived in Tennessee for awhile. And I bought a pistol there. And there was a fifteen day waiting period. You had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted. <SEP> And then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing. <SEP> That's not a bad idea. I think that a waiting period can make a difference. But again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that. <SEP> It is. So I don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because. <SEP> The only way they could do it would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun. I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course. I feel kind of weird about that anyway. I think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot. I'm. <SEP> We're getting into capital punishment now. But. But I agree with you there that. <SEP> It would definitely be gun control. Again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be. <SEP> It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one. <SEP> And I'm in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands. But the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element. Myself. <SEP> And they're actually a necessity in life. They're not. Not everybody needs a gun. But sooner or later I need one. Whether I'm out hunting or. I'm never had to protect my life or. <SEP> I did in the service but not on the street. So I don't really need one in the aspects. You don't have to carry one in your car or your pocket all the time. <SEP> So I use mine for recreation. I don't. And I enjoyed my guns. <SEP> I have a good time with them. So. I know what. I took my kids out and taught them out how to shoot a gun. My wife the same thing she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything. But we have several guns around the house. One of these days my grandkids probably. <SEP>. But I think it's. You got to have the. Living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot. But still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that it's not like on T V when someone gets shot they get back up. If someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up. <SEP>. I had to explain that to my. I've got a six year old now. And he. I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old. They understand now. <SEP> I've taken time to teach them. And now the young boy wants to know. And I told him you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and we would start with the B B gun deal. So he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows. And I took it away from him. I said now you know so he's learning the hard way. <SEP> But at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something. So. I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa Oklahoma that took me out and showed me. It was my mother's uncle. This was a gentleman in his sixties. And he took me out with him and single shot twenty-two and taught me how to shoot. <SEP> We went squirrel hunting. And he taught me how to shoot a old single shot twenty-two. And I was probably about twelve at the time. <SEP> And I thought that was the neatest thing. And of course Uncle Sam took me hunting with him. And he let me shoot and showed me how. <SEP> I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one. I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away. So. That's about all I. We agreed pretty well on this I think. <SEP> I think so. It's been real nice talking with you. Have a good one. <SEP>
