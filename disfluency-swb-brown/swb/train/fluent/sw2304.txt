. What are some of your favorite foods? Mine. <SEP> I imagine in Argentina you've got some great foods. We got a lot of European dishes. We got what some people call the best beef in the world. <SEP> So it's Bishu. Every Sunday you go out. And you buy all these parts of the cow. And then you just cook them over a grill. That's. In our house it's already built in. There's this whole special place in the back. So you can make a barbecue. I've had that meal in New York where they bring you a plank with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued. <SEP> And it's marvelous. And then. <SEP> I have to find a place around here that has that. They have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown. So. I'll keep that in mind. <SEP> You serve that yourself or for a family? Excuse me? You ever serve that yourself when you have company? The problem is I'm only twenty-two. <SEP> But when I'm down at home. And somebody says when are we having this. And I'll cook it. <SEP> You have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on. And then you put all these different meats which take different times. Do you buy them separately at an American grocery store. Or do you have to. You don't go buy it from a wholesaler. But what happens is in Argentina they have all these little places like the fruit stand and the dairy products and whatever. <SEP> Little butcher shops. And so. I've lived in Mexico. So I know. And so they got the meat place. <SEP> And so you just go there. And you can't find chicken there. You got to go to another place to find the chicken. You have poultry place. What dishes do you serve with it? Basically it's what we call it impenadas which is. <SEP> The turnover. The stuffed turnover. Meat turnovers. <SEP> I love those. And then we also put sausages on a bun. And then that's to start out with. And then what you have is also three different kinds of salad. <SEP> And that's about it. Do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker? <SEP> It used to be in Georgetown years ago. He moved. I guess he retired and went back to Argentina. I guess in the early seventies. So that's before your time. <SEP> Your parents might remember if they were here then. We were only there for two years. He was wonderful. We used to get the most marvelous impenadas and other Argentine things. <SEP> And what I also eat now since I graduate. I have an Italian roommate. And. I'm Italian. Are you? <SEP> And being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta. And. <SEP> Because there're many Italians in Argentina. And my mom makes what we call niokes and all this stuff lasagna and everything. <SEP> My grandfather came to the United States through Argentina. <SEP> This was around the turn of the century. Actually a little bit later nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen. At one point one third of the population of Argentina was Italian. Pure Italians. <SEP> I'll tell you. It's interesting because when we cook here. I'm of Italian descent. My husband is Chinese. <SEP> And we both love Continental cooking French cooking. So we cook. Our meals are. We don't usually mix. I mean that sometimes. <SEP> If we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe. And there are really easy recipe. That is with Chinese you always have several dishes. <SEP> And nowadays with microwaves. You can steam many of the things in a microwave. I don't know if you have one. <SEP> And if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done. <SEP> And it's a wonderful flavorful piece of fish. Is it? <SEP> Because I was at. It's like when you go buy fish. I buy the fish. So you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish. <SEP> And. I've seen the filet. Buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish counter. What kind of fish? <SEP> Any white fish. Sole is good flounder. Sole or flounder is real good. And even grouper. So we put soy sauce and sesame. <SEP> Little bit of soy sauce and sesame seed oil. And not too much soy sauce. Some chopped up slivers of scallions. And slivers of ginger. And then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes. <SEP> And if the fish flakes it's done. Don't overcook it though. Because I got one of those little microwaves. The ones that take forever to boil a cup of water. Just check it during. <SEP> And another quick dish if you like do you know what hoi sin sauce is. It's that sweet Chinese sauce? I don't. If you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N. Wait wait wait H. <SEP> H O I. H O I. S I N or S E N. S I N. <SEP> Either way they'll spell it. Hoi Sin sauce. It's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown. And if you take little pieces of pork little cubes of pork. And you fry them with garlic and a couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in. You can even put a spoon of ketchup in. <SEP> And that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice. How much pork do you buy for two people. <SEP> For two people if it's American style I buy a half a pound. If you're just serving that. But if you're serving another dish with it with guys pretty healthy appetites I'd probably go a third of a pound. <SEP> And then you could. I could probably go half a pound. And you can always heat it up again and save. So it's just since I'm from Argentina I just love meat. <SEP> And we. You can also do the same thing if you have ground beef. <SEP> Just stir fry the ground beef. Drain off the oil. Use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables. Just stir that in. And you've got another dish. And how much does it cost? <SEP> The hoi sin sauce? A dollar twenty-nine a can. <SEP> A can would serve you for quite a few meals. I thought it was maybe five fifty or something. It's not expensive at all. It's one of the Chinese cooking basics. <SEP> Listen it was good talking with you. Same here. Hope you enjoy your recipe. Thank you. <SEP>.
