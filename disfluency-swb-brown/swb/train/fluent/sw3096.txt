How do you view this whole subject? Are you one who feels like you have benefited from the change in roles in women? Or what do you think? <SEP> I. I think so. There's been a lot of changes. I think there's still a lot to be made though. I think so. <SEP> Are you someone who works outside your home. Or have you. I work for T I. <SEP> Have there been significant changes in the employment place especially at T I. Has anything in particular changed that you have noticed? During your time there. <SEP> I guess there's more women in what would be classified as a man's job. What kind of work do you do? <SEP> I am a drafter. I am in a man's job. <SEP> But we have got more women in it now. There's a lot of us in it. <SEP> In years past in fact even the word drafter has changed. Because it used to be they were draftsman. <SEP> We have some engineers that still on. The drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman. And I want to scratch it out and put drafter. But I thought I am not going to do that. Maybe not. <SEP> When I was in college. I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four. And I was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time. <SEP>. So I was in a lot of classes where I was either the only girl or one of just a very few women in the class. <SEP>. So that was a change. And even I did not use my math in my work. I became a technical writer. <SEP> But even so there were very very few women in technical writing. But that has changed a lot. <SEP> In recent years it has just really changed a lot. And I think that the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management. <SEP> But I think they have got a long way to go. There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the chair persons of the board are women in this country. <SEP>. And I thought that that's a pretty significantly small number. <SEP> So there are some strides to be made there. But I do not know. I think we have come a long way actually when I think about when things were like just when I was in high school and how it is now for girls. <SEP>. <SEP> And I guess my one bad thing is that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because I think she would have succeeded in a lot of ways that women were not able to succeed in her generation. <SEP> Do you. <SEP>. <SEP>. Do you have children? I was going to say do you have daughters. That's always a good question. <SEP> Do you? In fact I have a daughter who just graduated in civil engineering from college. Wonderful. Although there were some other women in her class she was one of the minorities females in the class. <SEP>. <SEP> So she definitely entering into a male profession. But for instance there is the organization the Society of Women Engineers. <SEP>. So that is recognized as a place where women should be. <SEP>. But I do not know. You see it in church where more and more women are becoming ministers. In protestant congregations. <SEP> And it will be interesting to see if Roman Catholicism ever recognizes women in the role of priest. I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or what you know about that. <SEP>. I am not either. But that is one area that I can see might change but I really doubt will change. <SEP> Not for a long time anyway. Probably not. <SEP> What in particular would you think other than the work place where women still are being found wanting or not as highly regarded as men would be. I was just trying to think. I know something. Maybe you could te-. Tell me what you think about this. <SEP> The role of women in combat roles during the war? Because I know that now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles. <SEP> And the only branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force. And I spoke because women were flying missions in the Persian Gulf war. <SEP>. But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job. It was real interesting. I was listening to some of the comments on television the other day about it. <SEP> And one of the men who was a. I do not know if he was a general or what his rank was very high. He said it's just a personal thing with me. I can not tell you why I feel this way. But I just would rather have a man doing some of these jobs than a woman. I thought at least he was honest. But that does not sit very well with a lot of folks I am sure. <SEP> There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women. Neil as far as I am concerned the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something. <SEP> Because mentally and emotionally I think women can handle a job and every bit as well. I do too. So anyway it's still. <SEP> And if she wanted to go to combat I do not see that they should stop her. <SEP> I personally would not want to go. But. I would not either. I agree. But I am sure that there are women who would relish that kind of job. So I guess that should be taken into consideration as well. <SEP> <SEP> This is an interesting topic. I have. Having a daughter who has gone into engineering I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did. <SEP>. She's a lot more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive than I think I was. <SEP> So that's progress I guess. I have enjoyed talking with you Lisa. And have you talked with a lot of people in this project. <SEP> Same here. Or. I am not at home a lot. <SEP> I am at work right now. I put my work number. But at home the recorder gets my calls. <SEP> Usually I am not there. But I probably talked to seven or eight people. That's great. <SEP> That's good. I personally have not made any calls yet myself. It never crosses my mind. <SEP> But I enjoy receiving them. That's good. <SEP> That's good. Because I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls. And only because I going to make some money. <SEP> Our choir is doing this as a money raising project. We got the connection through a T I church member. <SEP> And so we are doing it to raise money for a large project at church. So I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful. Financially painful anyway. <SEP> That's wonderful. <SEP> It's just real nice that way. So I thought I will just get on the stick and do it. That's great. I will say good-bye to you. <SEP> But I have enjoyed the conversation. Thanks for calling. Thank you. <SEP>.
