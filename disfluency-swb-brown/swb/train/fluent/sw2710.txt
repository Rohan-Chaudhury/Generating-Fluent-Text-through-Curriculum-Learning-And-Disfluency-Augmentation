I started when I was in college. They always offer credit cards for college students. So I went ahead and accepted every one that I was offered. Because I knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early. <SEP>. So I pack around a lot of them. But I only use a few of them. <SEP> You have a lot of discipline. They make it really easy for people to get credit cards especially college students. I have two daughters who both are in college. Or in fact one has finished now. But they both have a lot of credit cards. And they give you such high credit limits. <SEP> It's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap. And then they give you the credit limit. And then you're always seemingly up to that limit. I have quite a few credit cards that I'm always almost up to the limit on most of them. And that's how a lot of people get into trouble. I've got two that usually I'll have a balance on. <SEP> And then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and pay it off every month. And that way I feel like I'm getting a thirty day loan. <SEP> But I don't have to worry about running them up too high except at Christmas. Then they usually get run up pretty good. You have a lot of discipline. I'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine. I've paid off about four credit cards this year. <SEP> But still I have some that are up to the limit. And especially the Visa Card that you can go and get cash on. <SEP> And it seems like every time I'm short of cash I just go get it from Visa. That's. I've never used my Visa for cash before. Can you use it at a bank machine. J-. <SEP> Or. You can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say `` I want a cash advance. ''. Or if they've sent you a number that you can use. A personal identification number that you can use in the impact machines or whatever you can do that. <SEP> Because I have one that I don't have a pin number for. Sometimes you have to ask them for that. <SEP> And then I have one that just gave me the pin number automatically. We got. That's funny you said that. Because my husband and I got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for. A couple of weeks later we got pin numbers. And then we got a bill saying the yearly fee it was forty dollars. <SEP> And we cut them up and sent them back because we hadn't even applied for them. And we didn't want them. But they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us. So I thought I don't know if I trust this or not. <SEP> They do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time. Everybody in the world will offer you a credit card. It's let's see if we can get her to run up her bills. But it's hard. It's tempting when you see something to say `` I'll just charge it. ''. And sometimes I'll do that. But usually I will try to pay everything off the next month. Or the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time I'll pay more than the minimum payment. <SEP>. Just I feel like even that little bit helps. <SEP> The way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that I think we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible. That's why I've really started to try to pay off mine and get out of debt. Because we never know when we might get laid off or something. I know it. Especially me. I work for Texas Instruments. And they've had a lot of layoffs lately. I work for T I too. <SEP> You do? And I think they're getting ready to probably sell us out our division. Where are you? In Johnson City Tennessee. <SEP> Johnson City. I know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs. They just announced that didn't they? <SEP> So it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards. It certainly is. I have worked on a part time job where I was a collector. For a jewelry company. <SEP> People that. They just had this jewelry account. It was Zales jewelry in fact. And a whole bunch of peop-. They have about a thousand collectors I guess. And there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item. <SEP> And then they just can't pay for it. Something happens. And you hear so many stories listening to them. Like they lost their job. Or they've signed for a friend. They got it in their name. But they got it for a friend. And then the friend wouldn't pay them. Didn't pay them. <SEP> And now they're stuck with the bill. And it's ruining their credit. And you really have to watch this. Because. That's scary. <SEP> Because every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau. Automatically most of them do. I didn't realize that. And if you're. It's bad because if your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month. <SEP> But if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late. You're thirty days late. They don't recognize any time difference do they? <SEP> That's scary. <SEP> A-. And anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of. That's something I never thought about checking with to see what your credit report looked like. <SEP> You can do that. I believe it costs about ten dollars. Might be worth it for peace of mind. It is. It is. You might even find somebody's been reporting on you. And you didn't even know it. You might think you're paying something on time. And you by that day. And you're thir- thirty days is not real bad though anyway. If you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that. <SEP> That's when it really gets bad. Or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days. And things like that. I think that Discover Card has a good idea with giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you purchase. As long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back. And since they don't have the yearly fee. <SEP> Do they charge a lot of interest on that card? I don't know. I don't. I haven't gotten one. Just because it's. <SEP> I felt like with Visa and Mastercard and American Express you didn't need another one. I would think it wouldn't be much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges. <SEP> So that wouldn't be too bad. Always watch out for anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia. Or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest. I know I had a charge with Spiegel. And I hadn't read the terms of the credit agreement really. <SEP> And when I did I realized that it just seemed like I was never paying the balance off. And I looked at the credit card agreement one day. And it was twenty-three percent interest. <SEP> And that's the one bill that I hurried and paid up. And I've always watched it since then. That's awful. <SEP> You really have to watch those interest rates. I mean. There's no point in giving them any more money than we have to. That's true. <SEP> So they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent in Texas. But there are a couple of states that can. That's great. And one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta Georgia. I'll try to remember that one. <SEP> Let's see. I was trying to think if there was anything else. <SEP> I guess the worst problem I ever had with a credit card though was I got an item on my bill that I had never purchased. I had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork. But they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it. <SEP> And I changed my mind. But then they went ahead and charged it on my account. <SEP> And it took me about eighteen months to get all of that mess off of my account. So that's probably the worst thing I've ever had happen with a credit card. <SEP> I wonder if they.
