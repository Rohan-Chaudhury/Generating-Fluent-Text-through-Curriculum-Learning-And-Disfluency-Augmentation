I guess I enjoy eating out here and there. Or it's a good change from cooking and eating at home. And I guess I like a variety of restaurants. Sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal. And sometimes I enjoy going out having a formal meal. <SEP> And sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad. Something. <SEP> Do you usually go out with the children or without them? A variety. I like to go sometimes without them. And sometimes it's okay to take them along. So. <SEP> Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches. So it just varies. We do a mix. Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband. And it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table. <SEP>. So I guess actually there are times I even say don't sit us next to a table with other children. <SEP> This is our night out. But anyway where do you like to eat? <SEP> We don't have any children. So we tend to like to try all sorts of different things. And we're very attracted to exotic food. <SEP> And we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and sort of gourmet Mexican and things like that as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and Chinese and things of that sort. Of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too. And we probably go out one to two times a week. <SEP> And we're pretty much regulars at an local Italian restaurant. Which one do you like? Momo's. It's been a long time since we've been in there. But it's good. There's an Italian restaurant over by Plano Parkway there. Pas-. <SEP> Is it Campari's or something? I've heard about it. I haven't been in there. It's good. My husband had been in there several times. And actually we went in there for lunch one day. <SEP> And their pastas were great. That's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me. I like different kinds of food. So when we go out I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican Restaurant something other than the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas. <SEP> You're brave. And once in a while things backfire. We've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that. <SEP> And I'm not fond of some of those things. But we'll try anything. Ethiopian we've had Ethiopian. And not in Plano of course. I don't think so. <SEP> But we really do enjoy going out. And I'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires. Even though traditional it can backfire. I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or what attracts us to a restaurant. How do you usually find a new restaurant? My husband he's the ethnic fan. So he's. I don't know. You know what we read the D MAGAZINE. <SEP> So do we. We check that and the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there. They often do ratings of restaurants. So. <SEP> We often save those and ventured out on from there just for something that had a high rating. We have found a number of restaurants either through D the Friday paper and sometimes the OBSERVER. Which my husband usually picks up. And also through coupons. <SEP> When a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons. That's right. <SEP> And when they say buy one get one free. It's hard to resist. <SEP> So we'll go in. And very often we'll find a place that we like. And we'll stick with it. Once they no longer give coupons. We'll stay there. <SEP> But we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper reviews. We use the coupons too. That's true. That's true. <SEP> It's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got four or something like that. It's very expensive to go out to eat. That is really one of our. It's almost a hobby with us. I think that that's ex-. <SEP> Sometimes I think going out to eat it's sort of a recreation. Just a change of pace from eating at home. <SEP> So anyway. I guess as far as service when we go out it's nice to have someone come and wait the table. And clear the table and. <SEP>. <SEP> And do the dishes. And do the dishes. And actually it's kind of nice to. I always. A waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive. But it's not nice when they're too attentive. We've had experience with that too. So. <SEP> My sister who also lives here in Dallas tends to chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty. How we. But. It may help their tip may not. <SEP> What's your favorite restaurant? I guess just in Plano I like to go to Souper Salads. Chili's is always fine. <SEP> I guess if we go into Dallas we like the Routh Street Cafe. We've never been there. You would like it. <SEP> And that's supposed to be wonderful. You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome. <SEP> We've taken people there several times. And they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding. I guess it's whether you call it Southwestern. But we had venison chili one time. Which was absolutely wonderful. And then I guess it must be seasonal. And we've been back. I guess it's in the winter season. They've never had it when we've been back. <SEP>. But you ought to try that. It's very good. I would probably like that. One or two times in my life I've ever had venison I've loved it. But it's just not. I don't know people who hunt. So. <SEP> That's supposed to be a wonderful place. Here in Plano we tend to go to Momo's fairly often. And sometimes we'll go. We also go to Chili's and Colter's Bar B Q. And there is a little Thai place that's over on Park that we go to. My husband particularly likes that. We go into Dallas a lot because we're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently. <SEP> And we'll go down to Blue Mesa Grill. And. That's good. I've been there.
