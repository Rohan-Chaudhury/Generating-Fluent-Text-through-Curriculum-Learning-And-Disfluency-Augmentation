Do you do any recycling? We do here. What do we recycle? They recycle. They have bins. <SEP> And they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles. And I think that's all they have. What about you guys? We. There is a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is aluminum cans. <SEP> But we've got a couple of different places. They're like unattended aluminum can smashers. And you can go up there and redeem. We've got one that gives you a penny a can. So if you. <SEP> For smashed cans? Actually you have to put them in there unsmashed. And when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot. <SEP> Can you hold on for just a minute? I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because just succeed. <SEP> I guess. I heard it that time. <SEP> You guys only get a penny a can. When you buy canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit? You probably get charged a nickel or something like that. <SEP> And so it's like they charge you for the deposit. So when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just reimbursed. Type of thing. They don't charge us that extra nickel. <SEP> That's sort of nice though. It really is. Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the price if you want to think of it that way. So when we get a twelve pack then that's twelve cents back. <SEP> So you guys can actually get ahead. But they have sort of things that you're not reimbursed for or paid for. We can recycle clear glass brown glass green glass. And milk jugs and newspapers. <SEP> Everyone does newspapers. Everybody does newspapers. But that kind of stuff. <SEP> But they said they can't be smashed or else. It doesn't fit in their little containers. And they're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something. Maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed Pepsi cans and whatever up there. <SEP> Send it to this address. But let's see. They said that ways can encourage recycling. I tell you what really works at least down here is if there is even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it then people tend to do it. <SEP> That's. In other words taking care of the environment is all well and good. But if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as likely to do it as if you get something back for it. <SEP> As likely to do it. <SEP> That's true. So if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card to get money or doing your banking. <SEP> If it's free people will use it. If it costs them something then they're not as likely to use it. But I know we had a problem down here with people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the drain sewer. <SEP>. And all that because there was. Apparently a lot of people every time they change the oil. They just dump all their old oil down there. <SEP> Now they're starting to recycle that stuff. That's good. Another thing I thought of to recycle would be clothes because everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other. And one way that we do it sort of in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops. <SEP> And that way you don't get near as much as you bought it for. But you got the use out of it. And what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for. And so that's something that I've never. <SEP> We're new to Iowa. So that's something that I hadn't looked into before. But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle I guess. I know a lot of places they.
