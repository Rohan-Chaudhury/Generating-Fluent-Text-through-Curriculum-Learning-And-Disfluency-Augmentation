You heard the question. What do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs? <SEP> I'll tell you I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than I do now. I do the easy stuff now. I change oil. And then what some people would consider a little more difficult I'll change spark plugs. And I'll change points and do air filters that kind of stuff. <SEP> But I can't do as much as I used to. I used to do a whole lot more but not any more. They're just too weird to work on now. Is that the reason you're not doing it. Or are you so busy you don't have time to do it? <SEP> That's part of it. Part of it is like you said I don't have time. Being a female and being alone I don't do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even. <SEP> But have you had any major repairs recently? <SEP> On this car I've got now. But I had a van before. And it was only two years old. And it had transmission go out on it. But fortunately that was covered under the warranty. You should feel very fortunate. I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile. <SEP> And I'll declare that's an expensive. <SEP> Maybe I should have just traded the car in. Sometimes it makes you wonder. It just. I have a very comfortable car and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car. <SEP>. So I have a new transmission. <SEP> And I'm sure that any of them would have charged me almost the same amount. But. It hurts real bad. <SEP> Did you take it to a dealership? I took it to an independent out in Garland. <SEP> I see. I had. These people were recommended by a neighbor. <SEP> And that's the only thing. I am not a native of Dallas. I see. So that means I have to depend on trustworthy friends. <SEP> And that's. It's fixed. It's running. And I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it. <SEP> It's going to run for a while yet. I know it. It certainly is frightening. What work are you in? <SEP> I work for T I. I work in the networking area. <SEP> Do you work for T I? I have just retired from the Southwest Medical Center. <SEP> Where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car. But they're all too busy. So. I have to do it the other way. And that's find someone and pay them to do it. <SEP> So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year. I'm planning on it. It can't be any worse than last year. That's for sure. It could be. <SEP> But I don't much think so. That's true. That's true. We're starting out a new one. So let's make it a good one. <SEP> I'm going to try and plan on it. I enjoyed the conversation. Thank you. <SEP> Thank you.
