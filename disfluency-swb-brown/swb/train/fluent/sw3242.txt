How did you like that topic? I don't know. I've got mixed feelings about the topic. Do you? I don't. <SEP>. I'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know. I agree with it. I think a company should be able to test any employee any time they see fit. I just don't think there's a place in our environment in the work force for drugs or alcohol either. <SEP> I don't believe in drugs or alcohol. But if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the T CAT they were talking about drug testing us. <SEP> And we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine. And we found it belittling. You did? <SEP> I can sort of understand that. But not being a teacher as you are I was not quite as sympathetic as I probably would have been if Kay were a teacher or something. That's true. But. <SEP> But then at the same token I'm not against. Because I look at airline pilots bus drivers people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers. <SEP> That's right. That's right. <SEP> It's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol. That's right. And I think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read. <SEP> And. But. In those areas I really do believe that maybe we should clean up our house. I think so too. <SEP> I agree with it. I know Kay's company. They started it couple of years ago. And so many of the people even the professional people they were so against them doing that. And I thought to me it's quite simple. You either need a job or you don't. The job is what provides all of your needs. And if they say you can't do this work I'd say I agree I won't do that. And I think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first. I think it's just like anything else a new concept. As I said if I have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted. It is. I can see where you would think. That is belittling I'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that. <SEP> But at the same token in education we can't do random drug testing on kids. That's true. Their rights are protected. You bet. They would really raise a stink if that was to happen. <SEP> What. But if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids when we see them and they're under the influence. <SEP> I agree with that. I wouldn't be opposed to it at all. It's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it tooth and nail. That's true. But Lynn I've enjoyed talking with you. I don't know how long we're supposed to carry on a conversation do you? <SEP> It's three minutes. And the clicker comes in when it's time to. We'd better keep talking because I've not heard it have we. Have you heard it? <SEP> Anyway we both sort of agree on it don't we about random testing. Do we agree or unless it's not me. <SEP> Listen. Here we go again. <SEP> If you agree that. I believe that truck drivers and people that have. Even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands if they come in stoned or they come in drunk. <SEP> And there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk. Is that right? You just don't think of that happening with teachers. <SEP> And he. I really don't. When I think of drug testing I'm thinking of the outside of education. We are as susceptible a society as anybody else. <SEP> I know that. But you don't think of that first hand normally. And. <SEP> Did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation. Isn't that mind boggling. <SEP> It was on the news tonight. It's mind bog-. I agree with you. I know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same good qualities as anybody else. <SEP> Then I think if push came to shove I'd probably be drug tested. Because it does. You think the benefit would be greater than the. <SEP> Because as I say I'm sitting there fussing and fussing. And yet I know of one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as out. And that was in your children's high school. <SEP> Isn't that amazing. And my children brought it to my attention. I never was there to see it. If it was true there I'm sure it's true with just about every school there is. <SEP> Because they represent a pretty good. <SEP> And that's not giving a good example to students. They don't need that example. But.
