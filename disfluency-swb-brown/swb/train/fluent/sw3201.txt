Do you have any recycling programs there? I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet. <SEP> We're a pretty small town. And the closest thing we have are bins out in front of Wal-Mart that show plastics paper liter bottles et cetera et cetera. <SEP> We've progressed a little bit farther than that. Actually they have. Parts of town. It may have even spread all over the whole town. And they will have these green bins. <SEP> And it's just as standard as a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump. And just along with a trash can you have this green plastic bin. And you put your bottles in it and paper and all those things. Aluminum. Anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin. <SEP> And I guess you can al-. And a lot of the restaurants they just have places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles. <SEP> And I don't know. I guess they're clear bottles. So a lot of people do have those separated. And of course they have the dumpsters the igloos. <SEP> And they have those strategically placed around the city. And they're actually going to extend it one of these days maybe to apartment complexes. And. <SEP> That would be good. Things of that nature. So I guess when you live in a bigger city it really becomes necessary. It's not anywhere near that. <SEP> We. As far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans. But that's as far as we go. Because I take them to a girl at work. And she goes and cashes them in because. I can do that for her. <SEP> And I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it. <SEP> We don't have anything here in Belton. It's a pretty small little town. I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans. <SEP> And. So that's about all that we're doing here. They're getting a little bit more on. They need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you can't. Because not a lot of people do really know what it's for. <SEP> They're doing a real good job of separating it here. And of course there you have a specific place to put your paper. And they try to get you to go ahead and separate it. But they actually have the door to door pickup. And I think it started out to be just kind of a test a pilot project. <SEP> And it went over so well that they just extended it. And it's almost. I don't know if it's done by a private company or not. It may be. But they just go around to each door and pick it up. That's excellent. <SEP> That's good. Let's see. And every year of course the phone books they tell everybody across the city to put all their phone books in the recycle bins. <SEP> Because phone books are pretty. For a bigger city they're pretty thick. They are. And sometimes you might have two or three. <SEP> So that's a big savings right there in itself. Ours just goes in the regular trash. <SEP> There's not a whole lot. And there are some places that will set up for old newspapers and stuff. <SEP> But usually it hasn't caught on yet. I'm hoping it will soon. The thing about newspapers and paper. Recycled paper is actually very expensive. So when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that. It's. They're not coming out ahead at all. It's really a cost. <SEP> I wasn't totally aware of that. It sounds good to the public. But there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something. Aluminum I don't know. They may be coming out ahead. But I know for a fact that the paper on that end they're not. <SEP> It's just good to recycle. But it's not to their advantage. And it costs less. <SEP> I can't think of anything else. I can't either. Because we're at a very beginning stages. <SEP> So. We look forward to it to get better. I hope you all come along a little farther in the future. <SEP> Me too. It was nice talking to you. You too. <SEP>
