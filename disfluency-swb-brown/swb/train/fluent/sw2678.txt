Jack what type of music do you like? I like classical and sort of popular rock type music. <SEP> I enjoy classical too. I never really had listened to it till I got married. And my wife enjoys it. <SEP> So I had never listened to it till then. But now I listen to it whenever she does. And even every once in a while I put it on myself. Wh-. <SEP> I used to play the piano. And I like Bach and sort of the baroque music Handel and Vivaldi and those kinds of. <SEP> Those are really nice. I like those. Though I couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says This is Bach. <SEP>. I don't know all that much myself. I just know when I hear it that I like it. <SEP> That you w-. What you like. How about popular music? Whatsever's on the radio is usually okay with me. But sometimes I have a hard time hearing the words clearly if I'm in the car and there's noise and stuff. <SEP> So. It's mostly just the tunes. I'm pretty much the same way. People always say ! the meanings of those words. <SEP> I know. And I'm always meaning? There's wor-. I just thought they just all sort of rhymed. <SEP> I know. I know. About the only thing I can remember after the song is over is the refrain. That whenever they say it two or three times. I'm the same way. It's funny depending on where you live. I commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury which is two and a half hours away. <SEP> And the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different. When. <SEP> Because Baltimore will play more what might be considered a little bit more progressive? And as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town that's two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever in real rural Maryland it turns into basically classic rock. <SEP>. And they don't. <SEP> Oldies or what? Mostly oldies. But classic rock with. When the Doors movie came out Doors was really on the radio there. Where you'd hear one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in Baltimore. <SEP> But in Salisbury that's all you would hear was This is the Doors !. So it was sort of a funny thing. <SEP> There's a big variation among the country. If you go down south country music and. Y-. That's. I'm starting to realize that. I never really thought about that much. But there is. <SEP> I didn't. I lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore. And I never really noticed the difference when I moved to this area? <SEP> I really didn't notice at all. It just seemed the same. But when I went more rural it really changed. <SEP>. Chicago has a lot of good stations. Does it? <SEP> In fact they have a continuous news station which is nice if you're driving and you want to h-. You don't have to wait till the hour mark. It's sort of constant. You just turn there. <SEP> And you get the latest news and everything. It's sort of like C N N. You turn on your T V. And it's on. That would really be beneficial. So. Because you never hear the news basically on the radio. I never get it. <SEP> And if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in the car all the time. <SEP> That's pretty good. So. I like to listen to tapes of music or stuff on a long trip. <SEP> And now you can even get books on tape. On fact my grandmother does that a lot because she's blind. <SEP> Or she's losing her sight or whatever. But. That in. I can imagine if you're driving cross country listening to a story. <SEP> S-. Lot of the classics are really on tape. <SEP>. So that's a lot of fun. But. That would be good. <SEP> We strayed a lot from music. I guess so. But I guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening. So as long you're listening. <SEP> So. But if you do have to go something I guess we can just cut off. <SEP>. Jack it was nice to talk to you. Nice talking to you Tom. And good luck. And I hope you get some more calls and make some more calls. <SEP>. Thank you.
