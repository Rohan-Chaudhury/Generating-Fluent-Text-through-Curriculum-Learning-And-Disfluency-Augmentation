What kind of puppy you got? I think she's mostly German Shepherd. She was. A person lives across the street from me brought her home from work because a coworker of hers had this dog appear on its front doorstep. <SEP> Somebody abandoned her. And she's only six to eight weeks old. And I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though. <SEP> She's this young. And she's almost housebroken. She actually asks to go out. That's great. <SEP> And. I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality. I don't know. I can't imagine what would have been wrong with this dog. So. I have a dog that God gave us too. <SEP> She just appeared. My husband calls her street dog. But we've had her now for about three years. <SEP> And I just. You get so attached to them. I had a. Last year I had another German Shepherd. This one was purebred. And he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door. But managed to get him to a veterinarian in time. <SEP> And on huge doses of antibiotics he actually got over it with seven hundred dollars in vet bills. <SEP> But he actually was able to get him over that. And then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy. And he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing. And then he got hit by a Cadillac. <SEP> So I couldn't believe it. That was really hard. And that was even harder for. I was on a business trip at the time. And the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street. <SEP> So they just felt absolutely awful. I bet. And I felt probably worse for them than for me. Because this fellow's wife who was watching the dog she loved that dog more than I did. And. She was really attached to it. <SEP> But it's unfortunate. But now I've got another one. So. How long has it been since the first one? It was just over a year. <SEP> It was in March of last year. So. It'd been didn't have one for a whole year. I had a German Shepherd before this one. And when she died it just absolutely destroyed me. I was just. I couldn't even talk about it for months. And so I decided that's it. I'm not going to do this anymore. <SEP> And then God gave me this dog. So. My dad's like that. He had a beagle that he loved. And when that beagle passed away he wasn't going to have another dog. There's no way. <SEP> And then the beagle died in about October. And by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him Humane Society and got another one a stray. And she turned out to be a great dog. And we had her for six years until she just passed away recently. And again dad went through the whole thing. But mom went an. <SEP> You just do. You can't help. It's like a kid. <SEP> It is. Hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life. When. My doggie that we have now she's mostly Golden Retriever. The vet called her a golden mix. <SEP> Who knows. But she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color. <SEP> And her nose is that pink. She doesn't have a brown nose. And she's sort of unicolor eyes are the same color and everything. <SEP> So. I named her Rosebud. And a friend of mine said that she gre-. This friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had a pet cow named Rosebud. And she said there's a lot of longevity in that name. Said my cow lived seventeen years. <SEP> That's not too bad. The Golden Retrievers are good dogs too. They kind of get that permanent smile to them. They're always always happy. I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy. And she's so easy going and so sociable. <SEP> She loves everybody. And little kids can just maul all over her. And she just thinks it's great. <SEP> This friend of mine has th-. It's the same guy that was watching my German Shepherd when he got hit. But went fishing with him on Friday and took. He's got a pure bred Golden Retriever. And then I had the puppy a little tiny puppy. And we went and took the two dogs up fishing. And this. They had a ball romping around. And you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in. Getting in. <SEP> And this Golden Retriever jumped in the really fast moving river current. And. Actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in. And I. He's just about a year old himself and never had really. I don't think he'd swum before. <SEP> But he jumped in the river. Did puppy go to? The puppy jumped into some of the pools but not into the. I was careful to keep her away from the fast moving water. That's good. <SEP> 'cause if she fell in then I'd of had to go in after her. And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now. <SEP> And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her. But this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and actually paddled up against the current and made it back to the shore and climbed up. And then he jumped in again. And he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon. He loved it. <SEP> Cocoa didn't think too much of it though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad. <SEP> But she got over it. So. The German Shepherd that I had before. We had a little pool. And she did not want any part of swimming. But she liked to get in the pool on the first step. She'd just get on the first step and lay down. In the summertime when it's really really hot. <SEP>. And she'd just lay there on that step and just cool off. <SEP> I live right across the street from a big lake here. It's on Oneida lake. And I'm wondering if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. I've got. The yard's all fenced in. So she doesn't run loose. But she could go in sometime if I'm watching her. So. The one that we had just didn't want any part of that. <SEP> And she. Baths. She hated baths worse than anything. It was just really a fight to get her clean. Have you seen CANINE. The movie. <SEP> You've got to see it. Especially since you have a German. It is so cute. An part of the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up. And it's just hysterical. <SEP> My dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. And that was the thing I couldn't figure out. Because he would go in the lake. It wasn't like he didn't. I-. Normally he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet. But if you wanted to get him wet forget it. That's how Cleo w-. She'd lay on her step. <SEP> But that was the only time she wanted to get wet. And she didn't want you getting her wet. Obstinate. Obstinate. But you really need to see that movie. We bought the movie. And I don't know how many times I've seen it. <SEP> And it came on T V the other night. And I was watching it again. And my husband heard me laughing. And he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie. I'll have to check it out. I saw the previews for it and all. And it did look like it'd be a good movie. But. It is great. <SEP> Really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately. But I got to do more fun things. We always wait until we can rent them. <SEP> I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force. And so I travel a lot. And. I'm a engineer at the Rolm Laboratory Griffis Air Force Base up here. So. <SEP> That's how I got into the switchboard project and all that. So. But it's nice having a dog here. The. There's just. <SEP> Un- un-. What's the word I'm looking for lots of affection unconditional affection from the dog. That's it. <SEP> Not critical at all. They're really wonderful. <SEP> It's been nice talking to you. We seem to be degenerating here. So.
