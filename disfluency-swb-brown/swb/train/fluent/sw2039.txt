My favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE. And it has been for a long time. But I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it. Do you by any chance? You do !. <SEP> Very much. Wouldn't you know. As a matter of fact I prefer public television. <SEP> And I particularly enjoy the English comedies and the English mysteries. I watch mysteries too. Is that what you're referring to? <SEP>. That is good. I like. Do you read? Vociferously. That's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books. <SEP> And the plots are more challenging than the sitcoms of regular T V. Unfortunately for us at least here in the United States the only access we have to that of course is public television. <SEP> I'm not a great television watcher in any respect. But the watching. What I do watch is usually news and whatever is on public television. Any kind of. I also am very fond of great performances in that regard. Me too. <SEP> But. Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF? That was a scream. <SEP> As a matter of fact Turner Broadcasting has been broadcasting all of the James Bond movies every night this week. <SEP> So I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week. I used to like him too. He was my hero. In fact I like Sean Connery to this day. <SEP> They're showing LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment. And it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven. <SEP> He can never cut it. That's true. I was just thinking that today he did well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies. <SEP> He does. <SEP> Whereas Sean Connery has maintained the ruddy look. But. I liked his accent too. And he can even be in movies that are not sexually oriented. And he still comes off great. <SEP> Last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something. He is. He had my vote double. <SEP> The man is sixty-two years old. I don't care. But otherwise we. With P B S and so forth. And I particularly enjoy the series YES MINISTER? <SEP> What's that about? That was about the Interior Minister. It was a comedy. <SEP> The Interior Minister in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that. <SEP> I've seen it several times. It's a scream. But I have to go to bed. I have to get up and work the next morning. I wish they'd put those. That's why I say did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF. It came on after DOCTOR WHO on Saturday nights here at least. <SEP> And it should. Of course I li-. Really it was. I don't think they should show it during prime time. But still it was funny. <SEP> I know. I'm not much of a television watcher. I read as I said quite a bit. I read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff. <SEP> What do you do? What kind of work do you do? I'm a Payroll Clerk. Just an accounting clerk. At T I? I have a friend who works for T I. And I work for a tire service here in. <SEP> I see. I'm from Dallas. The last two people who have called both worked for T I. And I just wondered. It could be T I -ers probably are participating more than anybody else. But I needed the money. This is five bucks here. <SEP> I think that's something we all ca-. Do you work for T I? I work for G T E. In Maryland. <SEP> How did you hear. We're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we? I guess not. <SEP> How did I hear about it? I work. They are gathering a data base for voice processing. And that's my field of work also. <SEP> So I know the people at T I who are doing this. And I heard about it. So I called them and asked if I could participate. And send in the forms et cetera and so forth. <SEP> We could go back to television shows. Speaking of public TV have you caught any of this series on the Bible? I have. I've heard that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true. <SEP> That's. You could interpret it that way. I think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth. But the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself after the King James Version when the committee wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in Greek. <SEP> For example. In Greek there are seven different words for love. So you can have. There's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for love of your father and that sort of thing. So those types of interpretations really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it's at. <SEP> So that's. You can look at it as though they are saying it's not true. But there's too much historical fact involved just from the histories that were developed around that time that are available. To deny that at least the majority of it is true. So it depends on how you look at it. <SEP> You can look at it. If you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true then you can very much look at it that way. I guess if you're looking for that you're. You can interpret the T V show in the same way that you can interpret the Bible. That. <SEP>. <SEP> But as far as that goes we at least agree on what we enjoy. That's right. But I don't know if there is a time limit on this so. <SEP> Surely we've made it. I think so too. Let's just. It's been very pleasant talking to you. It was very nice talking to you. <SEP> And have a good evening. You too.
