. Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there? We've got quite a few actually. What we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city. The. <SEP> We've actually had some warnings in Raleigh on air pollution. You mean for smog and stuff? <SEP> Because of there so many cars. And we have a belt line around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic. And it's just surrounding the city. And you can actually see it. There's a couple of tall buildings in Raleigh. <SEP> And you can actually. They're blurred. They're even dark. And what it is is the pollution. What do you think of the greenhouse effect that's going on? I guess that's the fluorocarbons. <SEP> And. That's causing the hole in the ozone. That's very serious. We're even feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the jet stream. It is scary though isn't it? <SEP> The last two years our winters have been absolutely nothing. Maybe one snow. North Carolina. That's up there by Kentucky isn't it? <SEP> Kentucky? North Carolina is all the way on the east coast. <SEP> It's further west than Georgia. It's right below Virginia. Kentucky's next to Virginia I'm pretty sure. I'm from Kentucky. I should know. But I don't. I'm sorry. But Kentucky we use to have just real cold cold winters. <SEP> And we'd have three and four feet of snow. Course here in Texas they don't have snow. They don't know what snow is. They freak out when there's snow on the ground. Originally I'm from Texas. So Amarillo. So. Amarillo? <SEP> That's close to here. Real close. How long have you been in Raleigh? <SEP> I've been out of Texas about ten years. How old are you? Twenty seven. I almost forgot my age. We're the same age. <SEP> I forget my age all the time. So that's okay. I think it's just something that goes with the territory. But to me Texas and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school. <SEP> In Texas if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain I swear they close everything down. I just laugh. I do. They get. And traffic slows down to nothing. <SEP> Actually they've been doing the same thing here. It's kind of funny. I guess northerners are different. But even North Carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather. No northe-. I'm from the north. That's why I said in Kentucky we. I don't know. You just get used to the weather. And of course the people down in south they're not used to cold weather and stuff. And it just. I don't know. I just laugh. Every time they have snow on the ground everything's closed up. <SEP> And you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road. That's true. But. <SEP> Do you all have much pollution there? Not really. Not to see it. Of course T I is here Oscar Mayer. And there is a few factories. But I don't see much pollution going on. <SEP> What irks me is these cars that are driving down the road. And you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe. They have a test or something like that. <SEP> And that's supposed to cut down on it. <SEP> Supposedly that's supposed to catch it. But I'll tell you what. And even these buses it real bad. These buses in Raleigh. School buses and the commercial buses. <SEP> School buses are notorious. They're burning that diesel fuel is what it is. And it gets bad. <SEP> You know what they've started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top. And that way it gets above other cars on the road. That's a good idea. <SEP> And it really does make a difference although it settles. Even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles. And if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's even more miserable. I'd have to go out to the country to jog. The pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes. I didn't know that. When I was pregnant with my first little boy I had read it. Because I was walking back and forth toc-. Not back and forth. I was walking home from the college I was going to in Kentucky. <SEP> And I was having to walk along the highway. It was just one day a week. But it was in. I have no sense of smell. So I couldn't smell this. But it would make me sick. And I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway. <SEP> That's bad. But. It's. All the exhaust. That was four years ago too. It's probably a lot worse now. <SEP> I'm sure. You can really feel it in your breathing even normal people. And if you're older you can really deplete your oxygen. And it'll pass out. <SEP> And it's killed several people. Do you smoke? Actually I just smoke one in the evening if that. So I'm a very very light smoker. It's kind of l-. <SEP> It was kind of funny. They were doing some ozone testing the E P A. And they were just screening some candidates. And I don't think I'd ever do that. But they asked me if I was a smoker. And I didn't fit into the smoker's category. And I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category. I was just one of those. Because you do smoke one a day. In between people. So that kind of threw them off. <SEP> But they're doing a lot of research here the E P A. For the air pollution. For ozone and all that. They're real big into it. They've got Research Triangle Park here. And they're just doing a lot of stuff. But they. I don't hear much about it down here. Course Texas we don't have a bunch of pollution. <SEP> But too we've got that air coming in off the coast. And it'd blow it up north. <SEP> So maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here. But. It would seem like it would be the same way on the California coastline wouldn't it? <SEP> I think I would hate to live in California the smog there. I can't believe they have warnings here which it's mainly just when it gets real real hot. But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially. <SEP> That's kind of good to know. Because I thought I lived in a halfway decent area. I think they do that for most everybody. Especially it's usually for the young children and older old people. <SEP> You ought to come to North Carolina. It's a big change. It is? <SEP> There was no trees where I was from in Amarillo. And here they've got the mountains the beach the trees. They've got streams rivers ponds. <SEP> It's really pretty here. This is pretty wooded area down here. So. Is it? In a lot of parts. I know Texas is supposed to be flat. But down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of. <SEP> Sherman and Denison. Do you know my grandparents live in Durant? They do? <SEP> They live close then. Real close. I go there. In Durant Oklahoma? <SEP> You go where? you go to visit them? <SEP> We used to go fishing in Lake Texoma. Down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area. This. But Kentucky's beautiful. They've got trees. And trees are supposed to purify. You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff? It's a philodendron. <SEP> It's supposed to filter the air for you in your home. I'm going to have to get some. I had one. My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago. <SEP> Do you smoke? I do. Do you? I do. <SEP> Did you smoke when you were pregnant? I did. I couldn't make myself quit. I did cut down a lot. <SEP> I can understand that actually. I've got one vice. And smoking is it. I don't drink. And I try not to cuss. And I do very little. And smoking I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen. <SEP> One thing I miss is the people from Texas are. I miss their morals their values and everything. It's. We're down here at the Bible belt aren't we? I wasn't saved until I got down here. And people down here are just. There's so many Christians. And it's so different from Kentucky. But. How'd you get involved in this research? I worked at T I for a while. But then my brother-in-law works there. And he got me into it. <SEP> I see. How'd you get into it? I was taking a voice I O class and actually doing some research. And so they told me about this project. It's fun. I like talking to new people. <SEP> And a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl. I've had to hang up and stuff. But I enjoy it. I talked to people from Carolina up in Boston and New York. <SEP> Boston is New York isn't it? Boston's above. Boston Massachusetts. <SEP> But I've talked to people in New York. But I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. I guess it's because T I -s down here. I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. I had one call actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and. I can't remember where all. From up north like you said. I think one was from Boston. With Boston I love their accent. <SEP> I do. I love the Boston accent. I met a girl from Boston one time. My husband was in the service. So we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas. And his family's down here. <SEP> We're out of the service now. I bet you're glad. He got out of his unit right after Panama. He went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that. <SEP>. And he.
