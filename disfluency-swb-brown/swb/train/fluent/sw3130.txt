. Do you have recycling in Sachse? <SEP> We do. We've got a pickup twice a week that they come out. Do. And they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody. And they take it. <SEP> And it's twice a week? We have recently started a bin program here in Plano where. <SEP> Used to be we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up. And now they have these large green containers. And you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there. And then they haven't started curbside recycling yet. But they're planning on doing it very soon. Apparently the trucks that they had lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia. <SEP> And so that put off the program for a while. But do you recycle? My kids do. Do they? <SEP> Put it that way. They've been recycling cans for extra money. <SEP> So that's been their summer money. And they're fixing to go to Disneyland. So. <SEP> That's great. That's the way we started too. My daughter was going to Camp Goddard which is through the Plano school system in the fall couple of years ago. <SEP> And she had to earn money for it. And she was too young to baby-sit. So that's how she started. She started recycling cans. And from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and aluminum cans and plastics. <SEP>. Is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go. And they weigh it or whatever. <SEP> And. The only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans. The rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling. <SEP> And so we don't get paid for that. But that's okay. It's not that much of a bother really. You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever. And we use a lot of two liter bottles. And milk cartons and things like that. <SEP> It's amazing how much plastic you generate. I was amazed at how many cans that we got. <SEP> Because when the kids first went down I said that's great. And I was thinking maybe I'd help supplement it when they turned them in. But it's amazing how many cans you go through. And how fast they accumulate. It really is. <SEP> All that stuff. And how much we have reduced our waste. That we're generating a week. I know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said there's no way we're going to have to have pickup twice a week. They were real upset. But they were only picking up once a week. And we said to them if you recycle you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container. <SEP> And it's really amazing. The other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings. He got a little mulcher thing. <SEP> It's just a little attachment for the lawn mower. And we mow once a week. More often then that. And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the lawn. And it's amazing. It's amazing. We don't collect any of that. And that has cut down a lot in what we throw out. We don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard. So if it gets mowed I do it normally. <SEP> And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it. It's too heavy. <SEP> So I just mow it and leave it. It just soaks in. Sure it does. Sure it does. It really does. And it. Actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're catching your grass clippings. <SEP> That's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn. It's amazing. <SEP> I like it better doing it. One. It cuts down on my mow time anyway. That's true. And you zip through it quicker. That's true. That's true. I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it. <SEP> We probably will. It's really not that much trouble. We keep a garbage bag in the garage. And as soon as we use something we crush it up and put it out there. And then every few weeks we have a recycling center near Wal-Mart. <SEP> They have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in. And it's really no trouble. And I feel like at least we're doing something. <SEP> I read a magazine article. And they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution. But it's not. If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save thousands and thousands of trees. A day just from not throwing out your newspapers. And when you read that you think maybe it is a big deal. <SEP> What makes me sick is when they show the dump sites and how big they are. <SEP> Or in New York the barges that go up and down the river. <SEP> And they don't have any place to put it. And it just floats in the. It's ugh. And that's really not necessary. <SEP> It really isn't. If everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference. It would make a huge impact. So I'm excited about the recycling program in Plano. I can't wait for them to get it started. Because it'll be that much easier for us. Like I said now we have to take it over to Wal-Mart. It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up. <SEP> It's convenient out here for them to do it. What do they pick up? It's just. <SEP> They pick up the plastic the glass and the newspaper. They do? And do you have to sort that? <SEP> And they will do the alum-. Or do you just put it all in. You just put it in the one bin. And I guess they do the sorting. But they'll do the aluminum cans too. But we don't give them those. <SEP> The kids keep those. So. So you're doing that now? You're doing the newspapers and the glass? We don't take the newspaper to begin with. When neither one of us are home to read it. <SEP>. <SEP> So we don't have the newspapers but the plastic and the glass. At first when it first started it was hard. Because you're just used to throwing things. My husband would come home and go through the trash and say you threw this away. <SEP> <SEP> He would get all upset. And I'd say. It's just such an automatic reaction. And now we think before we throw anything away. It is. It's really funny. We really. Once you get into the habit of it it's okay. It's just making it a habit that's hard. <SEP> I know. The kids have even got to the point where if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can they're don't do that. And they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain. And then after a couple of days they take them all outside. And I put them in a big bag anyway. <SEP> And then they dump the bag out. And then they crush them. So that's their activity thing. To go out there and crush. That's fun. <SEP> That's a lot of fun. That's a lot of fun. That's great. I'm to hear you're doing that. <SEP> I. My sister was here recently from Connecticut. And they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans.
