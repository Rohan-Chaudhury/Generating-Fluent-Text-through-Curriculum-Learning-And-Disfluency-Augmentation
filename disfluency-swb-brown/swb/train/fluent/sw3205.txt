The question was on lawn and garden work. How do you like it? I don't do much of it here. I'm from Colorado originally. And there are no bugs there. And I didn't mind getting in the dirt there. But I'll tell you what. Once I see these bugs around here I'm just kind of out of it. What kind do you have? <SEP> Roaches and. Do they really? Cockroaches are awful here. <SEP> Just awful. So I. And I know somebody that lives there. And they never mentioned that problem. You're kidding you're kidding. It's a d-. Maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here. And. They probably just take it for granted then. <SEP> It must be. If they lived here a lot of people I know just say I just stomp on them. It doesn't matter. They make good fertilizer in the garden. Me personally can't. I don't have that problem. It's. Mine is mainly. We kind of have an understanding that I said I'll do inside work you do outside work. <SEP> And so I get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that. <SEP> But I don't like it dirty. I have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really. I don't know. We got the question. And I thought this is going to be interesting. Two bits I'll get a man to talk to me because they get stuck doing it all. <SEP> But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work. And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home. So we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall. <SEP> Today we just had a lot of rain. <SEP> So it's kind of nice. I don't know how yours has been. It's been real hot here lately. We've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything. But doe-. It's supposed to rain again this weekend. I see. <SEP> So then. We're leaving tomorrow. And we're going down to New Orleans. And from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie. This is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there. And I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity. But as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know too much about how much I really do enjoy it myself. <SEP> Do you like it at all? Not here. It's just here. I just can't stand to even get out in the dirt. Just. How about when you were in Colorado? <SEP> I liked it a little bit. But I didn't. I was working at that time full-time and didn't have a lot of time for that. And so that really hampered it a little bit. And then too where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly. My water bill was high. And if you have that on a regular basis in Texas I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off. <SEP> And with children you probably don't have time anyhow to get into it. <SEP> Not really. It's so very good. I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we? <SEP> Sounds like i-. Afraid not. Hopefully they'll give a subject I like one of these times. Something I really know a lot about. <SEP> Wh-. Nice talking to you. Nice talking with you. <SEP>.
