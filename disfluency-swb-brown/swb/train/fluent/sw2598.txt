Do you want to start? G-. I'm trying to think what I've seen lately. We-. We just finished watching TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape. Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES. Did you see the movie? <SEP> We've seen that. Did you like it? It was great. Have you seen it? I thought it was very well done. <SEP> I. How about GHOST? We saw an we liked it. But I didn't think it was as good as all the hype was about it. I feel the same way about that too. It was okay. <SEP> I don-. I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for best picture. And wh-. Let's see. The most recent ones that I've seen are those two GHOST and DANCES WITH WOLVES. But I rent videos. Do you? And so we just. You watch many? <SEP> It depends on wh-. Do you like the classics like GONE WITH THE WIND and the older movies. I'd like to see those. There's three movies that I keep telling myself that I should see one of these some day that I haven't seen that are classics. Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE. That was good. <SEP> And I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND. I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies but in a long time ago. And the MALTESE FALCON and all those. <SEP> I def-. We saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on T V a couple of years ago. That was good. And I've been wanting to see all of it. But we walk into the video store. And we're why don't we go see this now. So. It's true. <SEP> But I think-. One of the movies we saw recently we saw MISERY. I didn't see that one. That was good. <SEP> It was great. And it. You think because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory. But there's only one. There's a couple scenes at the end there is some blood and everything. And there's one really bad scene where there's not blood but it's pretty graphic. <SEP> But it's a really good movie. Is that the one where the guy gets captured by that women? <SEP> He's a writer. And she's his biggest fan. And she's also a little on the nutso side. Did you see PACIFIC HEIGHTS? <SEP> We haven't. I saw that one. That one wasn't that great either. It wasn't? I didn't think so. <SEP> Oka-. I got. I heard mixed reviews of that. We s-. How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? That's on our list of things to see. I know. I wanted to see. I was curious if you had seen it. And that. <SEP> N-. Our big thing is. Movie prices up here. I think it's six bucks now in the theaters. So it's. A lot of things we try to catch at the dollar theater or matinees. And then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape. That's us too. True. I know it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive. <SEP> Ye-. One movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Have you seen that? <SEP> It was great. It was. I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than ad-. <SEP> It's an odd film. And it's really interesting that. I like the director a lot a guy named Tim Burton. Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE? Part of it. I never really watched the whole thing. <SEP> If you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. If you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. <SEP> It's. Burton's kind of e-. He's a very odd man. But he's. I think he's very interesting. And I liked those two movies of his a lot. He did BATMAN also which. That was pretty good though really. <SEP> It was good. But he was. When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies. You see it for a couple of hours or an hour. And it really. There's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars and all the different stuff like that. <SEP>. Who's your favorite actress or actor? <SEP> Don't really know. I like Costner a lot. But I'm a big baseball fan. So after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS. <SEP> Although. That was good. I saw that movie too. That was very good. Which one? FIELD OF DREAMS. <SEP> FIELD OF DREAMS was good. And I think I liked the other movies he's done. NO WAY OUT was really good. And. Did you ever see SILVERADO? SILVERADO. Who was that with? <SEP> Let's see. Danny Glover Scott Glen Kevin Kline Brian Dennehy Jeff Goldblum's in. John Kreas is in it if you don't blink. That. The title sounds familiar. I'm trying to thi-. It was a big western. I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you'd miss her. It was. And I think it was a three hour movie or two and a half hours. And it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out. <SEP> But it was really good. I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I would remember with him in it. How about REVENGE. Did you see that with him? <SEP> I didn't. Is that any good? With Anthony Quinn. I thought it was. I like everything he's done so far. It's one of those movies that it's not a great movie. But it was okay. <SEP> We were in the video store today. And somebody was recommending it to somebody. The people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else. It was not a bad movie. I'll have to catch it one of these days. You sa-. You said you seen NO WAY OUT? That was excellent. <SEP> That was very good. He was in THE UNTOUCHABLES too. That's another one I wanted to see. Tha-. In fact that was advertised not too long ago. It was on. Cable? <SEP> It was on one of the networks last weekend. Or two weeks ago. I know I saw something about it. I wish I'd seen it when it was originally in the theaters. And I saw part of it again. <SEP> I like Costner. I like Sean Connery. And there's this one actor. It's really silly that I enjoy him a lot. But I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in a guy named Charles Martin Smith. I don't know him. You've probably seen him. And just an. That's who the guy is. <SEP> Do you remember. Did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI? I don't think so. Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN. <SEP> In STAR MAN he was the guy chasing after Jeff Bridges and Nancy Allen. W-. Short nerdy guy with glasses. <SEP> He's just. I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in. He was in the UNTOUCHABLES. He was the accountant. I know who you mean. He was in HONEY DO N'T SHRINK THE KIDS wasn't he? <SEP> You're thinking of Rick Moranis. He looks like Rick Moranis. But he's not. Se-. That's the one I was thinking of. But I've seen quite a few movies. I enjoy them. I think that it's kind of good entertainment. An escape type of thing. <SEP> How about some of the ads. Do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews? Do they influence you a lot. A little of. E-. E-. A review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see. Did you see GOODFELLAS? <SEP> It's o-. I want to see it. That was pretty good. And. We want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also. But my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago. <SEP> But I've never seen either of the GODFATHER movies. So we're probably going to rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere. I was just going to say you should see those first if you can. If you read the book it's even better. The book was excellent. <SEP> I haven't never read it. And I was a little disappointed in the third on-. It's GODFATHER THREE. It was not bad. But I expected more I think. <SEP> We just rented a couple weeks ago a movie called THE FRESHMAN. With. It's got Matthew Broderick in it and Marlon Brando. And Brando does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER. It's one of the reasons why THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately. But there's a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school. <SEP> And in his classes they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER. And then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing this organized crime head. So it was a fun movie. How about Tom Cruise do you like his stuff? COCKTAILS. <SEP> Or. I liked RAINMAN. I thought it was interesting that he was doing som-. That was good. I liked RAINMAN too. <SEP> I'm. Being from Baltimore of course I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies. N-. Barry Levinson did DINER and TINMAN and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore. They sound familiar. I probably saw parts of those. A lot of times I'll start watching a movie. And I'm tired. And it. <SEP> Next thing you know it's. Especially if there's commercial in it. Ye-. We-. And then the titles might sound familiar. But I really don't know what they're all about. <SEP> Ye-. Of the three of those DINER's probably the best. They're all pretty good. But DINER is really worth seeing. Is that the one set in the fifties or sixties. Late fifties. Late fifties. I think I saw that one. <SEP> And. How about Meryl Streep.
