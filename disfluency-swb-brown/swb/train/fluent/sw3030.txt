. I guess I'll just start by saying that we entertain with a gourmet club here. Which means that we have eight people four couples. And most of the husbands. This is really peculiar. Most of the husbands cook. <SEP> The wives during the day get so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day. They don't really care about gourmet stuff. But it was the guys that got together and did all this. <SEP> That's nice. And my husband just he really really likes to cook in terms of barbecue. And all guys like to barbecue. I think it's caveman. I'm telling you. But he really does cook. And it's a good thing because you can't knock that. <SEP> But all these other guys do too. And so we've gotten together. And we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals. And it's really really kind of a neat thing to do. You. <SEP> How often do you meet? We try. Because everybody is so active with their kids and all that. It's like if we can do it once every six months we're doing well. So we originally started out when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids. <SEP> Then we tried to do it every other month. But lately it's just been once every six months. <SEP> That's much more reasonable. I was involved in a club where we tried to really do gourmet meals. And we were a little bit too frequent I think. <SEP> I don't remember if we were once a month. Or anyway it was difficult. By the time we went around it was four couples. So by the time we got around to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired. Partly because gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining. It's too rich. It is absolutely. <SEP> And so we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day. So we kind of. And then one of the couples moved. And so we sort of didn't continue it. And I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you don't have as much time for regular entertaining. But when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be kind of good for everybody. And that sometimes means you can't do gourmet because depending on who your guests are. <SEP> That's true. And we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish. So he can get within. <SEP> One of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all. So that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese. <SEP> I take that back. She can't eat some cream cheese. But that really limits. It sure d-. It makes you keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out for something like. <SEP>. So we try to keep all that in mind. But otherwise I guess entertaining. I guess I have recipes. I. But that's basically what we do is the gourmet. <SEP> So they would be pretty elaborate. But it's fun. It took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff. <SEP> And you get all prepared. But you're right. It's very very rich. And I'm glad we don't have it every. <SEP> Because it's quite a treat. It really is. <SEP> Sounds wonderful. But you like food. And I just love the community of food. I just think it's neat. I do too. <SEP> I just love sharing meals and whatever you can do to do that. I don't think you have to be more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard the coleslaw and potato salad. <SEP>. But. <SEP> My daughter is graduating Sunday. And so we're having a few people in Sunday afternoon. And I did a cop out on to it. I'm buying cold cuts. <SEP> I have to make a cake. What are you providing? And I have to make hors d'oeuvres. And I have to make dessert. So I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches. <SEP> There you go. So I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on. But I can't do it working full-time. And it's just too much. I know. We're all not built like Martha Stewart. <SEP> Those people that try to do everything. We all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and time to t-. <SEP> Wouldn't that be nice? Shot a video of the whole thing. I don't know. <SEP> But it's really kind of a neat thing. I get a kick out of it. I really do. Everything all parts of the food. I love to make things from scratch. Making breads. <SEP> And people really pretty much appreciate it. They do. It's very difficult to purchase items that are as good as what you can make yourself. I think so. <SEP> In spite of. Or if you do buy it it's extremely expensive. In fact I just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts. And I bought turkey and pastrami and barbecued ham at an Amish market near here. And I've never been there before. And found that there's individual vendors. <SEP> And the foods are wonderful. And one of the vendors had cakes. All sorts of wonderful cakes. Fresh strawberry cheesecake and so on. And it's thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake. Which is really not such a bad price. I decided I just couldn't quite make myself buy it because I do make cheesecake. And somehow I didn't want to do that because it. There you go. <SEP> But I was very tempted because it looked wonderful. And they had black forest cherry cake and all those things. But those are homemade. They are not commercial bakery made. And in that they are made in their homes. So it's kind of interesting. It's out there if you want to pay the price. But. It is. We have bakeries around here that you just gain weight going by the door just like that. <SEP> Just smelling the air. But I don't know. I guess some of the best things I've ever had some of them were just hors d'oeuvres. <SEP> Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that I have a kick making that. I get off on strange little details of food I guess. But we have so much going on here because this is Dallas. <SEP> This is the southwest. This is chips and Picante sauce and anything hot. You can always make it hotter and lots of stuff like that. <SEP> So. That's a really good party time eating all that hot food. And they just love it down here. It just. <SEP> We like hot food too. So. All the stuff that goes with that. So. You don't sound like you're from Texas originally though. I'm not. Thank you for noticing. <SEP> I'm from Chicago. I thought that there was a slight difference in accent. And how I got. <SEP> And how I got to Texas by way of Virginia and everything is a long story. <SEP> But. <SEP> I'll bet. Do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy. Or is it always complicat-. I. In fact it just came to mind. And this.
