. H-. <SEP> Do you do a lot of dining out? We don't although we enjoy it. We do it more when we have company come. What about you? <SEP> We do some dining out. I do a lot of cooking. So mostly when we go out it's my husband and I. We don't go out too often as a family unless it's a fast-food kind of thing. But we do enjoy dining out. One of our favorite places here in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe. I don't know if you have you ever been there? I've heard of that. But I haven't been there. Where about is that? <SEP> Actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and. I've been to Cafe Pacific. Have you? That's down in Highland Park. <SEP> It's Highland Park Village. Did you like it? I love it. Before we moved to the area my brother lived in Dallas for a number of years. <SEP> And we came up one time when my father was visiting. And we all ate there. And their seafood was wonderful. <SEP> It's fabulous. It really is a great place. Where is the Atlantic Cafe? I believe it's on McKinney. <SEP> And originally the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe. And then they separated. And the guy started Cafe Pacific. And I loved them both. I really do. I think they're wonderful. That's our favorite. What we'd really like if we just have a casual evening is Houston's. Have you been there? But I've heard that's really good too. And. It's wonderful. The only thing is you have to wait. You have to expect to wait at least an hour. <SEP> So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there for an hour waiting to get in. And as long as you know that it's okay. But they have just about the best prime rib anywhere in the area. <SEP> I love it. And my husband really likes their ribs. So it's hysterical. We go in. And we sit there for an hour waiting to get in. And then we get there. And we don't even look at the menu. You know right away what you want. <SEP> I know right away what we want. We really enjoy prime rib too. And actually the Steak And Ale out here we've gone to. My in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night. <SEP>. And the time we went the prime rib was really good. <SEP> Was it? I've been there for lunch. But I've never been there for dinner. And it was good. <SEP> That's great. That's great. Another nice place for prime rib is Baby Doe's. I've heard about that too. <SEP> Maxwell's nice. Have you been there? But. I guess we eat out even less than I realize. And I didn't think we ate out very often. Baby Doe's is nice. <SEP> And one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to is Lawry's. I've heard that's real good Lawry's Prime Rib? I had heard that too. <SEP> I've never been there. But I've heard it's real good. Have you been to the Cafe De France right here on Central Expressway? <SEP> Actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to. They have real nice lunches. Have you been there for lunch? Or. <SEP> Primarily lunch and breakfast sometimes. But during the week they often have a limited menu choice but very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that included the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert. <SEP> And the. My husband and I like veal a lot. And their veal dishes have been good. We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the. <SEP> The specials. Have you ever been to Biffin's? Huh-. <SEP> I keep hearing about it. I keep hearing the advertisements of it. I. And they keep saying it's wonderful it's wonderful. I have not been over there. And I was thinking it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl. And. <SEP> And I've not been there. I haven't either. One place. And I've only been there for lunch. But I went with a friend. And we met her husband down on Greenville. Down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's. I've been there. We just we-. <SEP> That was nice. It was. And we both enjoy mushroom soup. And Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup. And they did. It was wonderful. And we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert which was a chocolate sack. <SEP> I don't know if you tried. Or s-. <SEP> I've heard of it. Where it's made. It's like a. It's all chocolate made like a paper bag. And it's filled with whip cream and strawberries and something? It had a sponge cake and whip cream. <SEP> And it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry puree. <SEP> And we shared one the three of us. And it was plenty because it was very rich. But I wished I'd had a camera. <SEP> It was beautiful. I bet it was. I bet it was. <SEP> The last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day. And we took another friend with us. And for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves. And so they had a berry assortment. It was raspberries and blueberries and strawberries on a plate with a custard on the bottom. <SEP> And they did the raspberry puree just kind of in a decoration on the. You know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it. <SEP> And it was outstanding. It sounds wonderful. It was really relatively simple. But it was good. It was really good. That's one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant. I love fresh berries. And their fruits are always exceptional. I don't know. They must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market you can't find them like that. <SEP> You can't find them. And. <SEP> I'm originally from Connecticut. And I was home a few years ago. And my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner. And I was really amazed. The restaurants up there were kind of quaint. They were real real pretty. But they lacked the service. And they lacked just the I don't know. The restaurants down here seem like they have. I guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good. And I thought I would really miss that. I would too. Because we don't go out very often. <SEP> When we do go out in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess. And it's a whole experience. Of course you want the food to be good. But the atmosphere and service are important too. <SEP> And in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good. Because the ones that aren't so good just don't make it. That reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track. But it is wonderful. It's called Cafe Max. And it's at Plano Road and Campbell. They have the most wonderful salads. They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three. <SEP>
