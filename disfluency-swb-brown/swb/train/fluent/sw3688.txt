Do you have any pets now? We don't right now. We've. I grew up with pets. <SEP> My folks and I always had a dog and a cat some birds. <SEP> But right now we don't have anything. That. What about you? A matter of choice or compulsion? <SEP> We've just. It seems like we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something. And it was never convenient to have anything. <SEP> We were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house. Someplace where there. We can take care of it and everything. We've got some children who would just really enjoy having an animal a dog I think. <SEP> And What about you all? Right now I'm a student. And campus housing does not even allow thinking about that. <SEP> We almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat. Is that right? They're very strict about it. <SEP> But you like pets and things? I love animals. I was raised. Our house when I was growing up there was almost never at least one cat in the house. <SEP> It was almost always at least one cat sometimes fifteen or twenty. But always cats in the house. We enjoyed them. <SEP> We like pets. But you've got to deal with taking care of them and feeding them and everything like that. And our kids are. We've got some children. And they're not used to it on a daily basis. They. How old are your kids? <SEP> From fourteen down to seven. You sound like you've got some small ones in the background. One. <SEP> Is that right? Our first. He's about eleven weeks now. <SEP>. Where are you from? Originally? <SEP> West Virginia. I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country. But. <SEP> I've been to Charleston. Charleston West Virginia? That's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway? <SEP> In the north end of the state you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania. Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown. <SEP> That's interesting. So it's really up north in the country really. <SEP> I guess so. It's. My parents' house is three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far. <SEP> I see. It's pretty nice country up there? It's beautiful. <SEP> Hills or what? From my neck of the woods it's hilly. Maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation type variations from the valleys up to the hilltops. <SEP> Is it farmland? Not a lot of farmland there. Mostly it's. There's individuals growing their own food. Most of the agriculture it's more in the way of sheep and cattle. <SEP> And even that's small time mostly. The biggest chunk of what's going on there is industry. <SEP> It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants. Aluminum plants. There's two aluminum plants. <SEP> What are you studying there at Heidelberg? Computer engineering. What year? Just finished up my fourth semester. <SEP>. I hope that works out well. It's a big change. <SEP> I spent twenty years as a mechanic. What's. So. <SEP> Did you? You've got some experience behind you in the work force. <SEP> Are you shooting for a bachelor's now or a master's or what? I'm working on a bachelor's degree. I'm working on a bachelor's degree. It'll be compu-. <SEP> Hope it's a good program there. Hope it's a good program there. It seems to me from what I've been able to find out. <SEP> That's considered a pretty good program. It's nice and small which means if you don't get the class this semester then you've got to wait anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again. But it's worth it once you get it. <SEP> That's good. And probably a good student teacher ratio and things. Most the class are pretty small. <SEP> That works out real well. I was wondering what if you all were to get a pet if you were to move into an apartment. Or a house somewhere what would you get? First off we'd probably wind up with a cat or maybe a puppy. <SEP> I'm partial towards the larger dogs. Our last we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus. <SEP> Had a hamster or two. And they got to be a lot of fun. A hamster. <SEP> It's amazing how much character.
