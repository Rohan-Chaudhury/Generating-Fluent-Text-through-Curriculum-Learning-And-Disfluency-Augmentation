. Capital punishment. I honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion. In the way that it's applied or it's applied at all? <SEP> Applied at all. So I. How do you feel that it should be applied? I just feel like there's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets. You know? <SEP> And that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced? Not getting paroled in so many years. If you're going to sentence somebody twenty years let them stay twenty years. <SEP> That's. I agree with that completely. I know we don't have enough prisons. But there has got to be some kind of punishment For these people. There has. That's right. <SEP> Because if they turn around they get away with it. And they get away with it. And they get away with it. And then they do something worse. And they get a slap on the wrist. They get thirty days in jail. <SEP> And they final get up to where they kill somebody else. And they go through fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars. <SEP> That's right. That's honestly right. And it's. They have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways. You know? <SEP> They certainly are living at our expense. They sure are just because some innocent person can really. <SEP> I didn't. It seems like really a rough time. You know? I'm not saying innocent person. Let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance. When they go to prison it really seem like it's a rough time for them. <SEP> And a murderer well go to prison. He's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street. And be paroled and have served the sentence. <SEP> That's what people face with that choice. One thing I really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to. They'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's going to. That should be life. But instead in. Given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something and then turn around in thirty years that. And less they're out. <SEP> If they're even in that long. Or they appeal. And then they get an appeal that says it was an unjust amount of time an extraordinary long length or something. Time. I would just be. I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole. <SEP> I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent. I think people know that it doesn't. It's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective. <SEP> There's should be for this crime this is the penalty. You killed someone in cold blood or whatever. You get it back. <SEP> This is what's going to happen. <SEP> And it sounds horrible. It. I hear myself saying this. But I don't know what else to do with some of these people that are. But it's. I know. <SEP> Because they let them back out again. And they do the same thing over and over again. Same thing. <SEP> Then they put them back in jail. And they get out. And more and more innocent people are hurt or killed. <SEP> And these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system. And it's like I said at our expense. A lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either you know? <SEP>. But still it could. I know. You read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that something really horrible. <SEP> And they just get away with it. And nothing happens. And as far as the other states I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is. I haven't kept up anything like that. <SEP> I think Texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty. <SEP> And I know California had it for a long time. And then they took it off the books. They repealed it. And people like Charles Manson and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison and are now even though California has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes. <SEP> The people who were there originally when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are in prison in quote for life and are now coming up for parole. Some of them like Manson who's come up. <SEP> It's been denied fortunately. But. But still it came up though didn't it. <SEP> The jury that sentenced him sentenced him to death. And then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies. And then they reinstated it later. But the penalty didn't go back. You know? <SEP> It seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side and isn't protecting the rest of the people. The victim is really left out in the cold more or less doesn't it. Especially in things you pick up the paper. And you read you think. <SEP> And the laws are all the rules. Some of the things that would make sense to tell the jury that this guy has a prior criminal history where he's raped ten women. <SEP> And then he gets up for this one trial. And they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again. And so they say this is. I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever. But they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal. Or plead insanity. <SEP> And a lots of things. <SEP> To some extent if they would do something with some of those people. But that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too. They plead insanity. <SEP> And then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again. I. It just doesn't make sense. It's a scary world out there anymore where you're afraid to go out. I. <SEP> I know in the Dallas metroplex area I don't go out hardly if I don't have to at night by myself. And I grew up in a smaller town in Texas. And it wasn't that way when I was younger. Like I said I live in a small place. <SEP> We could go around. And. But even the small towns now though has really changed from when I was a kid. But now I'm raising children. It really is. Ever. You can't even. When I was a kid I would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where I was and I was back on the time. <SEP> And now I don't let my kids out of the front yard that I can't see them. See them. It really is. We're probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon. But I've enjoyed talking to you. <SEP> Good talking to you too.
