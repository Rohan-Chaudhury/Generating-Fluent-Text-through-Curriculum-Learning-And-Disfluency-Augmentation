Favorite type of music or musician or any. I don't really have a favorite type. I like a lot of different types of music. Do you? <SEP> I have a tape collection that I like to listen to cassette tapes. But it's pretty varied. <SEP> How about you? I'm very varied as well. I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for maybe heavy metal and that. That's exactly me. The acid rock or the heavy metal. <SEP> Even some of that I like okay but not mostly as a general rule. I don't care for that at all. I don't enjoy rap too much either. That doesn't appeal to my ears. <SEP> As far as the rap goes I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves. <SEP> And I like some of their songs. But as. I agree with the general rule I wouldn't choose rap either. <SEP> But I like to listen to what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz classical. <SEP> I don't. I like like I said pretty varied music. I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to like Billy Holiday. <SEP> I really love to listen to her. <SEP> And I even have a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo. And they're very harmonic. <SEP> They really are. So they're interesting to listen to. You might try that. How about you? I listen to specific. Most likely I would be listen to jazz or classical music. In college I took four years of classical guitar. And I played in the jazz combo all four years. I play guitar for the jazz combo. <SEP> So that's where my two listening enjoyments are. But jazz can get on my nerves after a while. You can't just listen to it especially a lot of the deeper stuff. You just can't listen to it for enjoyment. Unless you're playing it. It's too. You have to concentrate on it it seems. It just doesn't do anything. <SEP> What about the blues or something like that? Blues are okay. I tell you I do like. I grew up on blue grass music. My dad is a big blue grass fan. And so. I wouldn't have admitted it when I was in high school. But I really do like it a lot. <SEP> So. I like some of it. As far as what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it? It doesn't. It doesn't. <SEP> Some of it sounds more like pop music. They've all got the real screechy electric guitars now. I don't care for that. If I'm going to listen to today's country western I have tapes of Randy Travis and Clint Black. <SEP> And I even liked Jim Reeves. <SEP> I. I grew up on him. Or Merle Haggard and Faron Young. <SEP> That type of country western is what I like to listen to. <SEP> Asleep At The Wheel. Sons of the Pioneers stuff like that. <SEP> I like sound tracks a lot. Do you? It seems like you get a lot of original music that way. You sure do. <SEP> Think about the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent. <SEP> Things like that I like to listen to. I like instrumental things. I have some Spiro Gyro tapes. They're great aren't they. <SEP> They're wonderful. I love them. I have some dulcimer music. Like I said that's pretty varied. It sure is. <SEP> Al Jarreau he's somebody I like. He's kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop too. I like his. He has a nice smooth voice. <SEP> And what I like the most about him is I've gone to see him in concert and he looks like he's having fun. Some people sing. And they have their faced all contorted like it hurts them or something. <SEP> But he looks like he's having a good time. He's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it too. <SEP> And he is real fun to listen to. <SEP> Bonnie Rait I like her a lot. In fact whenever she won her big Grammy. <SEP> I think it was five of them or something. Was it five. Or. Something like that. It was last year wasn't it. <SEP> Last year or the year before I can't remember. But I was listening to a particular radio station. And the one D J said who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies? I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that radio station any more if that D J can make such a unedu-.
