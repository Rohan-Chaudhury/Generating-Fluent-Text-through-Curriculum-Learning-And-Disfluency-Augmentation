You live in Dallas? I live in Dallas. I understand that the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down. <SEP> I think right now it's kind of bad. I don't live in a house. I live in an apartment. Are you in a house? <SEP> We have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington. I guess the best I can do is compare apartments. <SEP> If it can compare the one that I have now with the one that I had the last time the one that I have now has a lot more amenities than the one that I moved out of. This one gave us free cable and ceiling fans. And it was practically new when I moved in here. And the carpet was new. And. Do you live in the high-rise? <SEP> It's not a high-rise. It's just a two story building. But there are a lot of buildings. But it's just two stories. On the second floor they don't have a patio. But they have a sunroom instead of the patio. On the first floor where I am there's a patio. So you have one floor all to yourself? <SEP>. The rooms are nice and large. And let's see I have two bedrooms. And. That's nice. Do you get your own washer dryer? <SEP> I have a washer and dryer area. And I did buy the washer and dryer. But they didn't provide it. The one that I moved from didn't have a place to put them. And that's one of the reasons that I did move. That is nice. <SEP> Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat. <SEP> Tell me ab-. I've always been pretty lucky. The real estate out here's been pretty good. The prices came down last year. We had sort of a Dallas syndrome. The past year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia. <SEP> It's a real good. It just never happened before. So it's really surprising everybody. All the developers don't know what to do. <SEP> It's a good time to buy if you're in the market. Unfortunate-. We actually have our house on the market because we have two kids. <SEP> And we have a three bedroom house. And it's pretty much filled up right now. So you want a bigger one. Get an extra bedroom or a basement. Right now it's just a single level rambler. <SEP> One thing about the houses in Dallas they don't utilize basements the way they did in New York. My parents in New York had a three family house. <SEP> Actual a. Two family house where the downstairs and the second floor they had. And then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment. <SEP> And they had a basement. And they finished the basement. And they were able to rent that out also. But in Dallas I just haven't seen basements in houses. <SEP> And I've looked at a lot of them. A friend of mine was thinking about coming down there. And that's what he said was that it just wasn't something that people had down there. It's a-. They put pools and garages on but no basements. <SEP> I have yet to see a basement in a house. <SEP> And. Maybe it's all the sand. Is there a lot of sand in. I always think it's like a desert. I don't know. Dallas always. I don't see that kind of sand here. There are some areas though where they have a problem with the houses kind of sinking a little bit to the. <SEP> Or the foundation is sinking or something. Just a little bit some more than others. But you have to know the right spot to pick where that doesn't happen. <SEP> And. Out here we live in what used to be a prairie or whatever a natural grasslands. And they. It's just you go down four inches. And fourteen inches you get to sandstone. <SEP> And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast. I see. It's just solid sandstone. <SEP> Where did you say you're at Colorado? Virginia. Virginia. Virginia. That's right. It's sort of unusual really. Most of Virginia is clay. <SEP> Anywhere near Virginia Beach? My folks used to live there. Back before I was born they lived there. <SEP> Different areas in Dallas have different kind. In Texas I'll say. Because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay. And in the Dallas Fort Worth city areas you don't see that. Texas is a big state. So I imagine the type of houses and things like that are truly different from area to area. <SEP> But that's the same way out here. Because for example we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington. And anything instead the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive. <SEP> So I could never afford a house inside the beltway. That's why we came out here. This is called the country with only maybe twenty miles total from D C twenty-five from the city. But it's considered the country since it's that far out. <SEP> But. We live out by Dulles Airport. I see. And that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia. They have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here. And it's still pretty rural. <SEP> Not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore. Land has gotten so expensive. They just can't afford to have low income housing like that. Is your house in an area by itself? We're in a development. <SEP> It's not connected to another one? There's. There's another one a quarter acre away rather. <SEP> But they're not connected are they? You have to stay in one single family home. I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up. My folks had an apartment for a while when we were kids. But for the most part they always had. And Pennsylvania always had a single family home. And so as soon as we could we got a single family home. <SEP> And that's all I ever knew growing up. So. I stayed in a townhouse for two years and then saved up enough money to get a.
