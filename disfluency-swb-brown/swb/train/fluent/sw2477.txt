What basketball teams are you interested in? I guess I'm a big L A Laker fan when it comes to pros. <SEP> The college ranks I really. Of course I try to follow my alma mater. That's B Y U in Utah. But they don't have much of a team usually. They're more of a football team than they are basketball team. <SEP> You see them in football on T V once in awhile. You never see them on nationally basketball. That's true. I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball. <SEP> Last year they had a really good team. The year that Danny Aines was there. That was about five six years ago by now. <SEP> So they made it to the sweet sixteen once or twice in their history. That's not too bad. <SEP> And that's. And they usually lose in the first round. <SEP> How about you? I'm originally from the Saint Louis area. So the only basketball team in that part of the country is Chicago. So I do pull for Chicago. Of course this year is a good year to be a Chicago fan because they're doing pretty good. <SEP> Is it the Bulls you're talking about? The pro. As far as college teams I know it's really easy to say. But I've been pulling for Duke for about four years now. So I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams. Although I've really. <SEP> Is that right? Again being from Saint Louis I pull for Missouri. But they're on probation this year. So you can't do much about that. <SEP> But. Did you watch the final four this year? I watched all three games of that. <SEP> Every game? And I was very pleased with all three games because Kansas. I was pulling for Kansas on the other side. So it was real nice to have the teams that were there. Of course I wasn't really. I. U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a macho team. They seemed to think they were better than everybody else. And maybe they were. But I was real happy to see them get knocked off. So. <SEP> I watched that game. And it was a good game. <SEP> It was a very close game and hard fought game. And it just. I don't know. It looked like U N L V may have had more talent. But as far as playing together as a team that day Duke seemed to have them off balance. <SEP> And that they couldn't. Aren't they more of a running gun team? U N L V. They play the pro style is what I've always called it. And. <SEP> Fast breaks and things and. The fast breaks and. They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed. And. And U N L V wasn't used to that. Of course I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time. I don't know if they were necessarily behind. But they weren't ahead as much as they normally are. <SEP> And that meant that they had to play a second half. And they've not had to do that all year. And. They didn't have to go through some tough games during the year. So that's a terrible time to have to deal with that when it counts so much. That's right. Duke's schedule was so much harder than U N L V's that it just made them a much tougher team overall. <SEP> And that had to help them a lot. I think that probably was the difference in that game. <SEP> Because it really could have gone either way. Down to the end. Do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will win. Or. <SEP> I don't know. Probably not. Portland's pretty good. Since Kareem's retired they haven't had a center. <SEP> And they've got Perkins. But I don't think he's really been a super star for them. He's. I don't. I. He to me is not a center. He's more of a real tall forward. <SEP>. <SEP> I think Magic does a. They'll make it. It's going to be a war between Chicago and Boston Celtics. <SEP> That's going to be a war. That sure is. It. It's going to be a great series. I think that's going to be one of those that's won by the home team. <SEP> Whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think. One of those two will probably be in there. Let me see. Where does Detroit fit in? Detroit's in that same division. <SEP> So I don't know. Those three. Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year. But as I heard Isaiah came back this week. So that might help them. <SEP> They have the play-off experience. But. All three of them do with Larry Bird back. <SEP> You can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's starting to click on all cylinders. That's true. <SEP> They say he's starting to play. But he's been kind of up and down all year. One game he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in. And then the next time he can't seem to hit the side of a barn. <SEP> So I don't know. I'm not sure about him this year. <SEP> Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now. That's when you do it. He's starting to be more consistent at the right time of the year. <SEP> Any dark horses I. The dark horses. <SEP> San Antonio is the dark horse that could really flip in there I think. That's. Anybody who has David Robinson has got to have a chance anyway. <SEP> He's got to be pretty much. I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player when he. <SEP> Against any team he would dominate. But Robinson's getting up there where every game he's just. That's right. It looks like he's going in for a dunk. And they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back. <SEP> Nobody's got enough beef to challenge him when he's driving hard to the hoop. He's. Too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him. That's true. <SEP> With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble. Then he's gone now. So they don't have to worry about that. For awhile anyway. I thought he was gone period. I didn't read the story. But I read that. <SEP> I heard he was suspended. Because of his. That might have been what it was. But I guess the headlines said something about him that the Mavericks released him or something. Maybe I misunderstood what they meant. <SEP> If they did they'd still have to pay his contract. They may have done it. You never know. <SEP> It was a lot of money. He was making. But. I heard on the radio it was sixty-three thousand and change a month. That's what he was being paid. He wasn't even playing. <SEP> What a good job he had. That's what I think. He ruined his sweet position. <SEP> I'm looking forward to the pro play-off. It's coming up isn't it. L A. San Antonio. Who's the other one that's doing so well this year. Is that Portland? Portland. Portland. <SEP> Portland. I haven't seen them on much T V that much at all. But all I can do is hear about. They have the seeing eye. What do they have. Walter Davis and. They've got the two Johnson brothers. Or they're not brothers. But I mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something. I forget how that works. But like I said they're doing extremely good right now. <SEP> Phoenix isn't doing too bad. So it ought to be a real interesting play-off. <SEP>. I don't think there's any clear pick. <SEP> I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of Bird and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson. They are two guys that seem to find a way when they. When it's on the line. <SEP> When it's on the line they seem to find a way. So those are what makes a champion I guess. That's true. <SEP> It's been nice talking to you. Nice talking to you. Take care. <SEP> Take care.
