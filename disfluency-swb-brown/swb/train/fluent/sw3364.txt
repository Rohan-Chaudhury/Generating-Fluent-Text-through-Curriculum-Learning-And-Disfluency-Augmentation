What's your favorite T V show? I used to like ST. ELSEWHERE. <SEP> That's one of my old favorites. And that's. I'm being beeped. So I'll just ignore it. And now I did like THIRTY SOMETHING. My daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH. We like that one. That's one of my favorites. <SEP> And how old are you? I'm twenty-eight. So you're little bit younger than I am. But. I think if my seventeen year old my fourteen year old my other two children like it. I'm over forty. And I like it. I think it's wonderful. It's a good show. I like MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN too. <SEP> We are so busy with all of our kids are in sports. And I hardly ever watch T V. But that's one that we watch. And then Sunday nights we watch LIFE GOES ON. I like that. That's a good show too. Very good. Did you see the one on Sunday? It was a. I did miss that Sunday. I didn't. <SEP> That one kid that Becca likes he has AIDS. It's a good episode. The new character on there did. <SEP> All the way to North Carolina. What time is it there? It is twenty minutes to nine. I'm twenty minutes to six here. Three hours difference. <SEP>. What else do you like? Let's see I like a lot of different shows. Let's see I like MURDER SHE WROTE. That's. I never watched that ever in my entire life. And MATLOCK is another good one I watch. <SEP> Then during daytimes I like ALL MY CHILDREN. A small bowl will be plenty. That's mine. That's the only one I watch whenever I. A small bowl will be better because it's pretty fattening. Talk to my daughter. ALL MY CHILDREN. I've watched that for about twelve years. <SEP> I'm sure I watched it for more than that probably. Twenty something. I used to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager because I. I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed. So that was a long time ago. I used to watch it in high school and college when Laura's mother got killed. <SEP> She was my favorite character on there. I just. I read the reason they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract. And I said if they're going to do that to her I won't watch it. <SEP> That's great. I do like ALL MY CHILDREN. And I like it I don't know. I just. I like the people on it I guess. I like it. I just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back. Tad's going to come back I bet do you think? I'm sure he will. <SEP> He'll come back show up at just the right moment. I kind of wish that Nina would come back because the story. Just for a brief visit or whatever because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying and everything. <SEP> Daisy pops in once in a while. And I forgot about Nina and Cliff. Cliff's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now. He is. So he's out for good. He's out for good. <SEP> Did they marry? Nina and Cliff? That's how they left the show but not in real life. <SEP> Now she's married to some guy in New York. And she's happily married. And that's the reason she left the show. I guess she wanted a private life. I watch it maybe twice a month. So I don't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies. I watch. <SEP> Because I play lots of tennis. And I'm gone a lot. So I don't get to watch. I watch it everyday religiously. I videotape it when I have to miss it. <SEP> I used to be like that. I'm that way about a lot of different shows. I'm that way about MURPHY BROWN DESIGNING WOMEN. Don't they have a new chick on there instead of what's her name? There's two new characters on there. There's Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE. I don't know if you know her or not. <SEP> That's a show I like. And then the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART. I don't like her on it. I never have liked her. So. <SEP> I just know which one she is. I don't. She's taken Suzanne's part. And then Jan Hooks has taken Charlene's part. Charlene was Delta Burke? Charlene was Jean Smart the blond headed. <SEP> I never watch that one either. I really don't watch a whole lot of T V just on Sunday nights. LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner. And my whole family's home because I don't allow the kids out on Sunday night because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day. And so we sit around and eat popcorn. And then we watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS. Those are always pretty cute. MURDER SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that. And so. <SEP> So you don't watch that one instead of. I pick nights pretty much so on T V that I watch different networks. But BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO ONE OH I watch it religiously. <SEP> We like that real well. It. Be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebody's getting killed on it. <SEP> I know. The kids already know who it is. I don't know who it is though. Who is it? Ask them. <SEP> Let me ask Nicole. Nicole.
