. Ladies first. I don't find a lot of time to watch T V. And a lot of time I find it during the day when I'm rocking my little girl to sleep. So I watch a lot of reruns old shows Like DICK VAN DYKE all those old crazy shows. <SEP> Barney Fife I guess. I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH. Some-. So you're a homemaker? <SEP> I guess that's the right term nowadays. I guess so. I am. I stay home with two kids. My wife. We have a new one in the house. And she stays home too also. <SEP> I guess I have a wide variety. I like watching the T V for things that are interesting. Not so much the things that aren't. For example the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of a waste of my time and DIFFERENT STROKES. But I like SIXTY MINUTES PRIME TIME LIVE. <SEP> Of course I have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning but not the NINJA TURTLES. I like the old-timey ones TOM AND JERRY. <SEP> You sound like my husband. There you go. He likes TOM AND JERRY and BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS. And all those guys. <SEP> JOHNNIE QUEST. The good ones. If I'm ever home during the day on a vacation day I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW because he's one of my idles. <SEP>. But I don't know. It seems like nowadays everything is so electronic magnified and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings. <SEP>. And so now I do with the COSBY SHOW. I have seen it a couple of times. And I do. I like the show. I just don't watch it. Because of the timing. <SEP> But some of the crap that's on T V nowadays it's about. I do watch the special shows that they come out with the NOVA stuff. And the nature shows. <SEP>. But I think there's enough out there to pick from. I'm not. We don't have cable to the point of the H B O or any of that stuff. <SEP>. But. I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children. Because with two kids. <SEP> And I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch. Or I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN. Me. <SEP> And I watched that for ten or fifteen straight years. And then I'd eat. At work we'd have a T V or whatever. And then as my kids got older and started recognizing what was going on I thought this isn't really very good. <SEP> So I gave it up. Fifteen years. Bet they hated that. <SEP> I had watched it since it started. So. Now I don't know who the characters are. And I'll turn it on every once in awhile. And I don't recognize anybody. So I guess that's a good sign. I used to watch. I can recall. This might date me here. I can remember staying home when I was five and six and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT. <SEP>. You're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the SECRET STORM and the EDGE OF NIGHT. SECRET STORM. <SEP> I think they were back to back and black and white. <SEP> I was just a youngster. And I was. We used to. My mother watched all that stuff too. And. I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may still on or not. Still be on. <SEP> It was not too long ago. Now they got a lot of other crap involved. And so. You're right. I think some of the tones of the daily prime time is questionable. <SEP> And that could be. I have to agree with you. Keep them on the channel twenty one. The nature stuff. <SEP>. We do. And it's real interesting too the difference in my kids. My oldest loved SESAME STREET And those kind of shows. <SEP> My younger one doesn't. She's more into WALT DISNEY kind. We watch a lot of movies that we've got on tapes and stuff. She's more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing. But we do a lot of kid watching. <SEP> Sounds like you got your hands full there. And I do appreciate speaking with you. It was fun. Have you gotten your catalog yet? <SEP> I don't think so. I just spoke with Jim. I just got my in the mail. And it inspired me to make more phone calls. I don't really. I've had a few people call me. But I've never made one. <SEP> I need to get brave. Give them your pen number. That's what I need to do. Have a good day. <SEP>.
