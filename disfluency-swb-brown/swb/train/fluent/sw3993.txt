Do you do artistic painting? I do tole painting. You do? <SEP> I really love the tole painting. I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor. I would like to learn that someday. But right now my passion is tole painting. Do you do a lot of it? I took one class about three or four years ago. And I've done a little. <SEP> But it takes a lot of time. It does. It is real time consuming. And. Do you sell your projects? <SEP> Mostly I have just given them away as gifts. I've done perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and on and on just things like that. But I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job. <SEP> Where do you work at? I just work at Stop and Shop out there in Ogden. So. Do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique? <SEP> I've wanted to do that but just haven't mass produced enough to do that. I have five children of my own. So it's. That keeps you busy. <SEP> They keep me busy. And tole painting is just something I do in my spare time. So. Have you tried any of the. Do you cut out your own projects? I have my own saws. And so I really enjoy doing that. Do you ever spray your projects with a base coat first. Or do you brush it on? <SEP> I brush it on. I haven't tried a spray varnish. I use just a wood sealer. I just bought a spray gun one of those high volume low pressure spray guns. <SEP> And I do a lot of woodworking. And that's what I bought it for. Do you? <SEP> But I haven't used it yet. That'ud probably give you a smoother finish wouldn't it? <SEP>. What type of woodworking do you do? Fine furniture. <SEP> Do you? That's why I bought the sprayer is to finish my projects. <SEP> That's my worst part of my woodworking. I get so sick of making. But it's hard to finish it. But spraying does put on a nicer finish. <SEP> That is interesting. What kind of equipment do you have? For woodworking? Let me see. Table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers. And -t's about it. <SEP> It sounds like you're really into it. That is nice. It is. I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw. And I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router. The band saw is really nice. I have an Inca. I don't know if you've ever heard of those. <SEP> But it's nice to have the right equipment. That makes it easier doesn't it? <SEP> Have you sold any of your furniture. Or just. Not. Mostly I do like you do give it away as gifts. <SEP> But Making my own furniture. <SEP> That's interesting. Did you take classes to learn how to do that? Just in junior high. And then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment kept up with that. <SEP> So yours is mostly just a hobby too then. <SEP> That is interesting. I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to. I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture. But mostly just do more. The shelves and. <SEP> The woodworking. For your tole painting. <SEP> So it's fun. I guess I'll let you go now. <SEP> They come on. We're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us. They do? So this is my first one. You're probably a veteran at this. <SEP> It has been really fun. I've enjoyed this. Like I say I've made a couple of calls to Texas and just talked to all different kinds of people. <SEP> So I think you'll enjoy doing it. It's fun. Sounds fun. Where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here? <SEP> There's a shop in Roy that I really love. And it's there by the Copper Mill restaurant used to be the Hayloft. I am not famil-. We live in Roy. But we haven-. Is it on nineteen hundred? Let's see. I'm trying to think of the name. I know where fifty-six hundred south is. <SEP> I don't right off. Is that Ben Franklin then? Ben Franklin.
