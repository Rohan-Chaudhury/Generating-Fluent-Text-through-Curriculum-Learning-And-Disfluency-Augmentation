What are your favorite shows? It's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much T V. But the ones that are out now. <SEP> I've watched that SISTERS a couple of times. I think that's kind of a good show. I've never seen that. Haven't you? <SEP> I like that one. And I'm trying to think. I don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch. How about you? I like L A LAW not because it's realistic but it's entertaining. <SEP> I do like that. <SEP> Occasionally I'll see that one. Let's see. I watch CHEERS sometimes. And mostly just movies when there's a good movie on. Do you? <SEP> When there isn't a good movie on too. I just like to have the T V on if I'm home alone or something. <SEP> Have. Either the radio or the T V -s got to be on the whole time. <SEP> I do. I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately. I've been home with a. I have a baby. And so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much. <SEP> So I'll watch a soap occasionally. <SEP> Do you watch any of those? I don't because I work all day. But I pro-. I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days around Christmas or whatever. After a while I'll start watching it. <SEP> And then on. For a while I'll ask people if they know what happened. And then I'll just forget it. <SEP> What ones do you get into? I don't even remember. The last time I watched was back in college. It was GENERAL HOSPITAL or something. And I maybe watched it for a week. <SEP> But I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the. They wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera. How funny. It was a. <SEP> I don't get into them that much. When I'm home sometimes in the day I'll watch them. <SEP> But I was really trying to think. I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch or else. You said you have kids. How old? <SEP> I have a six year old. And I have a. He'll be a year old in January. So you aren't a SESAME STREET fan? They watch it. <SEP> My six year old's kind of. He's outgrown that one a little bit. But I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby. And he's entertained by it. <SEP> So. I do watch that one. Supposed to be a great babysitter. They're not entertained for too long with it. He's still too little. <SEP> But. I do turn that on. <SEP> And I do like DONAHUE. Sometimes I watch that. I think he has some interesting things on it. I know. What time is that on. I never see it? <SEP> It's on at four. I'm not home then. That's why I don't see it. I'll watch that occasionally. He's got some real. I don't know. There's some real weird people that he seems to come up with. <SEP> Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange? He does have some real bizarre things I think. <SEP> So other than that I don't know. What's that? Guess I'm not much of a T V person really. I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us. But. Tell me. Is it snowing up there? <SEP>. It snowed a little bit probably about four days ago. <SEP> And they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas. But do you have snow on the ground now? <SEP> There is snow on the ground. That's nice. I wish it would snow a little bit more. I've heard it's raining there. We've broken all sorts of records. <SEP> They've got. We still have some highways closed. And it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago. But just phenomenal. I. You see it on the news all the time. But until you've really seen it it doesn't really hit you. <SEP> But I was driving home from work Friday. And I saw there were some stop signs submerged up to the writing on the stop sign. And that was just. It was amazing to me. <SEP>. So there has been some flooding. And. There's been a lot. <SEP> It's too bad. But the thing is that this happens. In the last three years it's happened at least once a year if not twice. But the people continue to move back in the flood zones. <SEP> So I don't know. You got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for. I don't think I would. <SEP> Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood. What a mess. <SEP> Do you work for T I? I do. This has been an interesting thing to do. Have you made a lot of calls. Or. <SEP> I've probably talked maybe to five people. My husband is doing it too. And he's talked to a few more than me. <SEP> But it's been real interesting and kind of fun. Do you get paid for these? Five dollars. Five dollars a call? <SEP> I wish I could do that. Don't you have to do it as part of its. We can't get paid for it. <SEP> Don't you have to do it.
