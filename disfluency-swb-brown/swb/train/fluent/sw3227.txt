What kind of music do you like? I was thinking about it for a long time. And I like basically almost every form of music and type of music. I don't have a whole lot of dislikes. I like jazz especially the blues. And I like a lot of the classics everything back from Bach and Beethoven and Chopin and just in general everything. <SEP> I enjoy a lot of the modern forms. Do you like rock and those kind of things punk even. <SEP> That gets. Some of the punk when I was in high school that was one of the big things was punk music. And some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do. But the actual. <SEP> I don't think they have a whole lot to say even. It really expresses some of the opinions of the people who enjoy the music. I guess. But as far as a musical art form I just don't see a whole lot of art to it. <SEP>. Do you like rap? Some of it. It depends. The two types of rap I enjoy to listen to and one is the rap that is just funny. And they usually do a lot of satire. <SEP> That kind I kind of like. <SEP> Some of it is kind of pointless. The monotonous. That's not. I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about I'm better than you and. <SEP> I don't like that. I like the funny satire. And then some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in urban society. <SEP> It really does. It talks about race relations and police relations. And that. I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times. <SEP> I'm with you though. I like classical. I don't like to listen to it all the time but some of the time anyway. I like easy listening just kind of. I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more. I used to like it all right. But I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason. Let's see. Country western I'm not quite as big on that. Some of it's okay. That's about my opinion of that. <SEP> It's okay. Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess. The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it. <SEP> One country and western song sounds like every other country and western. A lot of them sound really similar. <SEP> And so the musicians don't get to really get into their music. They just play a certain number of chords. The drummer plays a certain beat. And you have a country and western song. <SEP> And. That's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes too I guess. They don't really. Has kind of the same sound over and over. And the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are. <SEP> You can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them too. And I can't say that I like a lot of the very modern rock and roll. <SEP> But I really enjoy the fifties the sixties and some of the seventies rock and roll. <SEP> Earlier things. And I really enjoy especially the sixties.
