Let's see. I think. I guess if I call I'm supposed to start. I think that's the way everybody has done it so far. But anyway I think that we are paying a lot in taxes. But I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money. We're probably one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have. The. As far as the quality of the streets the school systems the hospital stuff that the government gives money to. All the things that the government does like that. I think they need to manage it a little bit better. But I don't think anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now. So. <SEP> I have to agree that. And you're right. We do have a good government. We do have a lot of things that the taxes are there to support. But I do think they're mismanaged. And I think that sometimes it's to easy of an answer. It seems to say I'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or get all of the waste out of the spending. <SEP> I don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas. But it seems like we pay the state. There's. The taxes set by the state and the city can add theirs. And the county adds theirs. And we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now. Which seems to me nuts. I came from California. And when I left there we paid six cents on the dollar. And that was one of the highest in the nation. I think it's seven here. Seven point something. <SEP> Ourselves is seven point seven five. Whole state. <SEP> It drives me crazy. I'm thinking everybody is sitting here screaming about we don't want a state income tax. But yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up. And they don't do anything about it. Where are you at? What state? <SEP> I'm in Lubbock Texas. There's. We're still one of few that don't have the state tax. <SEP> That's true. And I did pay state tax in California. But. That. The sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay. That's true. You don't sound like you're from Dallas. Where do you come from originally. Texas? I do. I've lived in the Dallas area here since I was four. <SEP>. It's an urban area I guess. Whatever. I don't know. You just managed to escape the real Texan accent. <SEP> I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there. I've just lived here. But I don't know. I do. I can think of all the biblical things about it too. What did they say to. I can't think of the scripture. Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's. <SEP> That's right. Even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and Jesus said the money in the fisher inside the fish. And I thought of those two things when I was holding for a long time. <SEP> Were you really trying to find someone at home? <SEP> Back then what they tried to do. The would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would contradict himself. And so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation. And of course that's when he said you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's. You render unto God what is God's. <SEP> And of course there. I don't think they really cared about the answer. They just wanted to try and catch him in something. <SEP> But I believe in paying taxes. And. Like everybody else I try to take as many deductions as I can. I don't want to pay more than I have to. <SEP> And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons. But I believe that they're necessary. I really do. Are. <SEP> Do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work. Or. Not really. I spends a lot of time with our income tax though. Especially this year and last year. I have been married for just a few years. So I've had to really switch around from the E Z form to the. Schedule A. <SEP> All the deductions and all that. Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder? It really did. <SEP> I saw that too. I didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions the interest and other things. <SEP> We're looking at buying a house. <SEP> And that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house. And it will help tremendously. <SEP> We bought ours five years ago. And it's. The one thing. It seems like you make those payments every month. And at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles. So that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back. There's a thing I just. I've been trying to learn as much as I can about it. If you pay. I know I get paid twice a month every two weeks. <SEP> That's once a month. I get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in thirteen months. <SEP> That's right. So if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks Instead of once a month you'll come out paying one month extra every year. <SEP> That's right. And if have you a thirty year note it will take seven or plus years off of your note. That's right. My parents bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago. <SEP> And they did that. They thought their payment was automatically taken out every other Wednesday. And that's exactly right. Everyone. Though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years or something like that. <SEP> Just because of exactly what you said. <SEP> You're making one more month's payment every year. And that's going on the principle. It doesn't pay any interest. Or usually it doesn't. <SEP> So That's a good way to do it. <SEP> And when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment but not significant amounts. It was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner. That's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty. <SEP> We're not going to go longer than twenty. But we're taking our time. We're going to try to make our decision by July. <SEP> That's good though. We just started two or three weeks ago. And we're not going to just kill ourselves. Just two or three houses a week at the most. <SEP> That's good though. Is it kind of a buyer's market down there? <SEP> That's good. Credit union has nine percent interest. That's pretty excellent. So that's. I don't know. We couldn't think of a better time to buy than now. <SEP> That's good. But anyway. I can't think of a whole lot more to say. I can't either. I appreciate the call though. Me too. <SEP> I enjoyed talking to you. Same here. My wife she went to the school out there in Lubbock. In Lubbock? She was there for two or three years before we got married. I guess before I even met her. <SEP> Just a second. Go ahead. But anyway. <SEP> So she was at school out here? She went to school there. What was her name? Cathy Walker. <SEP> I didn't know any Walkers. Good luck in your house hunting. Thanks a lot. Y'all work at T I? <SEP> I do. You do. I'm in human resources. <SEP> That's interesting. I work in the waiver. Do you really. Because that's. I work with Elma. <SEP>. And I used to work. I did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years. <SEP> And then I have been in Human Resources for the last two years. And I work with those same people all those nine years. So I feel kind of part of the staff. I'm turning in a capital request right now. <SEP> You are. That's funny that's where you're from. What are trying to get? A machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers. <SEP>. So you work in back grind? I'm sort of an acting process engineer. Not officially. But that's pretty much what I do. <SEP> That's what you do. And do you? And. <SEP> Good deal. What did you think of Sam? I like him. He's hard. But we needed that. That's good. He's. <SEP> He was very good for Lubbock when he came to. It was the same kind of thing. He had a lot of good results. That's what he said here. He's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before. <SEP> That's been a real big plus. He's broadened the devices that we're making too which has made us as lot more stable. <SEP> That's good. Anyway it was nice to talk to you. <SEP> You too. And. They're are going to interrupt us any minute now. I can tell. I know they will. And besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed. Me too. <SEP> Have a good day. You too.
