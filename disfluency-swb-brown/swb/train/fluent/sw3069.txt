. I talked with people from Richardson and Plano. And the first three days. And then yesterday I talked with someone from Pennsylvania. So. Because. It's the. <SEP> I've only made. This is only my third call. I tried to make calls two different days. And I couldn't get through. I know. Sometimes I just. I'm in. It just takes a very long time. So. <SEP> Does it? I've been trying to do that. And sometimes I just can't wait that long. I know. So I just hang up. Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again. <SEP> This is hilarious. But I knew as soon as I heard your voice. I thought it's Kathy Kester. Tell me what books have you read lately? <SEP> Let's see. I can't even think. I haven't read any. And you're such a reader I know that. And I. I don't read all that much for enjoyment. I read a lot for school. But I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading. The last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom. <SEP> And it was called SMART WOMEN. Or something like that. <SEP> And it was kind of. I really didn't like it at all. It was written back in the early eighties. <SEP> And it was all this divorced woman syndrome of the. It was almost like a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing. Interesting. <SEP> It was really an interesting. Because I right away looked at when it was copyrighted. Because I could tell by the theme almost when it was written. <SEP> And it was all about women searching for themselves. And a lot of hanky-panky going on. <SEP> That kind of was kind of a pop psychology time when a lot of books like that were coming out I think. That's right. And so that makes real sense that that's when it was written. <SEP> I wasn't really aware that she had written anything for adults. I was always just more aware of her jer-. For her young people her books. <SEP> And she's more famous for that. But she has been writing for adults also. I'll be darned. <SEP> And so I thought I'll just try this and see what it was like. It was very. The style was very conversational. <SEP> You would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description. <SEP> You know how that is. And. I wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything in print. She has. Because I remember seeing a new book by her that was out. <SEP> And I think it was an adult book. I'll be darned. <SEP> But that's the last thing I've read. And. It's. The last actual book I read that wasn't. Let's see I think I read. When I was on vacation on semester break between spring and summer. <SEP> And I went to my mother's. I read a book that I should have read when I was probably in high school. I read JANE EYRE. I. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. JANE EYRE? It wasn't JANE EYRE. <SEP> WUTHERING HEIGHTS? It was PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen. <SEP> By Jane Austen. That's what it was. And I didn't know what to expect except I had heard that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist. And she really was good. I was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately. <SEP> And I just. But as I say I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then. <SEP> Because I think I read it in college or had to read it in high school or college. But I don't remember it. <SEP> And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg I got her someone. I think it was some actress reading it. How interesting. <SEP> They had an abridged version of it on tape. And so I got that for her. And she loved doing that. I'll bet. <SEP> But I remember that was the book. And now I think it's around here somewhere. I wouldn't be surprised. <SEP> I'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it. <SEP> But. I read that. And then I'm trying to think. Usually I try to find something long that I'm going to. If I have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while. <SEP> That's what I do too. And that's about it because otherwise I'm reading so much for school. I have just started reading a book. It's for school. But it's for. There's a literary jour-. Not a literary journal. It's kind of a journal of the history of ideas that's starting to be published from U T D. The first issue doesn't come out until next year. But. I'm doing some reviews of books to sort of recommend whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal. <SEP> How neat. And I've. It's really neat because these are brand new books. And I got this one. Most of the stuff is on literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that. <SEP>. This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach. And it's a biography that is really interesting. <SEP> That's fascinating. It's fascinating. It really is. <SEP> But it's so long. I don't really have the time to read the whole thing. But I think eventually I'll go back to it. But it was written. <SEP> The copyright is nineteen ninety-one. So it's a brand new book. It's a brand new book. <SEP> That would be wonderful to read something like that. And this man really shed some light on some aspects of Bach's genius and the more sociological things like the idea that to be a musician was as much of a family occupation as anything. <SEP> Families had just loads of musicians. <SEP> And they just went from generation probably to generation just with these all passing it from one to the other. That's right. <SEP> And. That's the way it was back then. So. <SEP> That's interesting. It was just really interesting. If that's kind of what. But I have to. Not only am I reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also because the board of advisers for this journal right now doesn't have a really respected name who's a scholar on music. And I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be in that position on the board. So. <SEP> I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not. But at least I can tell them what I think. That's rough. <SEP> That's real rough. So it's real interesting. <SEP> That's a neat thing to be involved in. Because I think my alma mater Gettysburg I think they were just starting a magazine that was similar to that. It is. <SEP> I think that's probably sort of a thing to do in small colleges. <SEP> But. That it. You see a lot of small colleges doing things like that. <SEP>. Because it attracts really a lot people's interest. That's one way. It's really good public relations for small schools. <SEP> I think so. But another one of my projects this summer it's helping a professor compile a bunch of translations of various poems for a book that he's writing. And so I'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people. <SEP> Translations what do you mean translations of. For instance a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people. <SEP>. <SEP> I see. And the translations are all so different from one another. All different. <SEP> That's interesting. So it's multiple translations of single works. And that's right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as. My work is just kind of compiling all that for him. So. <SEP> That's great. It's real interesting. You really lift me up to a different. <SEP> Here I'm dealing with cleaning the stove. And. Let me tell you There are days when I would prefer really doing that. <SEP> I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire. <SEP> That would be nice. I don't know if I've told you. But this is not on the subject.
