Who's your favorite team? My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pittsburgh? <SEP> You bet. I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little. I. When John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama. <SEP> So I kind of grabbed on to that team way back when. That's pretty nice. That's good. I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big steel curtain. <SEP> That's right. How about your favorite team? Last year it was Buffalo. And I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just impressed me as being so efficient. And they never score. They never blow out their opponents. They just score just enough points. <SEP> And that really impressed me. But then down here I li-. Is pretty close to New Orleans. And I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot. They are exciting aren't they? The Saints are starting to impress me this year a lot. <SEP> They are just a fun team to watch. They are really. Did you see the game Sunday afternoon? <SEP> I didn't. It was funny. They ha- a fireworks display at halftime. And some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire. <SEP> You're kidding. So they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire. Those big piece of something came falling out of the roof and landed on the field. So there's this big fire on the field. And they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything. <SEP> I can't believe that. It was funn-. You just really can't tell what's going to happen. That's hilarious. I know. It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints. <SEP> And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal. And it was beautiful right down the middle. <SEP> He is tough. He has an incredible leg. He is. <SEP> Do you think they're going to be able to make it this year past the first playoff game? I sure hope so. I'm not sure who they play. Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams. <SEP> Who's that? It's pretty much going between Washington. And Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice. And one of those was to Buffalo. And they beat the Saints. Their only time they lost. <SEP> What do you think about Houston? Houston. I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis. From what I saw they were playing. When I was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers. <SEP> And from what I saw the game Houston impressed me a lot. But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night. And if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night. <SEP> He definitely is one of the best I think. He's. Their backfield is really impressive. Haywood Jeffreys and Drew Hill and Allen. <SEP> They really impress me. They squeaked out a game on Sunday. That's right. Who did they play? <SEP> They played Dallas. Dallas. That's right. They won in overtime. All because. <SEP> That's right. I remember that now. So that was. I watched that game. And that was. Do you have a favorite between those two? <SEP> Because I'm right here in Dallas I kind of pull for Dallas. Also Houston is in Pittsburgh's division. So I'll almost always root against them. That's true. <SEP> I hate to say it. But I hate Dallas. <SEP> That's okay. I was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here. And they just kind of grew on me. I imagine. That's the way. I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two. And they've actually started doing something. <SEP>. So I've actually paid attention to them. Do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in? <SEP> To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that. What cities are they looking at? Right now I think this Memphis they're trying to get the teams. <SEP> And that's where I was when I saw Houston play. Saint Louis is trying to get a team. Baltimore is trying to get a team. And there's some other city. I'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham. But I'm not sure. <SEP> I think you are right. I think it is Raleigh. Think so? I think I remember hearing that. Because I know they've got a football team. But I think it might be them. <SEP> That would be fun. I'd like to see some more teams get in. I would definitely. I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after. And right now I think it's Memphis and Baltimore have a really good shot at it. Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis. And when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did. <SEP>. It's like the Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two.
