I really haven't seen any movies lately. So when the computer picked this one I was a little bit surprised. But I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about six months. But the last movies that I've seen were probably on video. That's. We rent a lot of videos too. <SEP> We saw. I have two little babies. And we saw one movie recently. And that was THE TERMINATOR movie which I didn't like after all. I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie. And that's kind of blood and guts isn't it. I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff. <SEP> I don't either. It. On all the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie. He doesn't. He maims them. He maims them pretty good doesn't he? <SEP> I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part. In the movie. <SEP> I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. I saw it. I haven't seen that one yet. Couple weeks ago I rented it and watched it. And I was pretty disappointed in it. Because I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense. <SEP> And I was pretty disappointed in it. It's a good movie. But I guess that they built me up too much. For my expectations in it there. <SEP> With all the commercials and everything. <SEP> I haven't. That's one we want to see. I want to see DANCES WITH WOLVES. But we haven't seen that one yet either. I haven't seen it either. But I've heard that it's real long. That it's a good movie but it's long three hours. <SEP> That's what I heard too. We've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it. That's right. So We saw the movie with Sylvester Stallone OSCAR. That's right. <SEP> OSCAR. Supposed to be his debut in comedy. <SEP> Which was an interesting movie but not very funny. I know my daughter saw that. And she liked it. So. Did she? <SEP> It was an amusing movie. It j-. I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to just at the house watching it with no one else around. <SEP> So. And of course I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO. And because I have a ten year old. So we watch a lot of movies around that category that she can watch. <SEP>. <SEP> My son just turned two. And so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie. We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID too. LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN are his two favorites that we've got. <SEP> And I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video SHIPWRECKED. I didn't hear that was coming out. It's fixing to come out on video. And I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out. <SEP> They just had THE RESCUERS movie. But. <SEP> That was a Disney movie wasn't it. I think I heard that was just out. He doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet. But he likes to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the movie. I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater. <SEP> I tell you ever s-. My kids are just small babies. And I tell you we really want to go a lot. And there's so much out on video now that it's almost. The movie comes out quicker than you can go see it. Sometimes. <SEP> That's right. And then they go to the dollar movies. <SEP> That seems to happen. I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the Granada Theater. And someone said that was a lot of fun to go do. You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie. I thought that might be kind of fun to do. That does sound fun. <SEP> And of course you need a baby-sitter for that. Definitely. But. I'd really like to get out to the movies more often. Course it's so expensive now too that you can't hardly afford it. I know we get discount tickets where my husband works. <SEP> But other than that it just seems like it's so expensive. And then the popcorn and everything else. You almost can't afford to do it. No matter what. That's right. Although we did actually get. We went on vacation couple months ago. And we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB? <SEP> That was kind of a funny movie with Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. That was fun. I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie. <SEP> Richard Dreyfuss is a psychiatrist. And Bob is his patient. And Bob follows him on vacation. It's. That's the one where they burn down the house or something. The house explodes? <SEP>. That's the one. Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is. I just forgot the title of it. It's supposed to be a real scary one. Here's another one that I've seen. I saw. I can't remember the title of it either. <SEP> Must have left an impression.
