Are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the. <SEP> I'll offer anything that I can on the subject. My husband and I just moved here recently. And we bought this house about year and a half ago. What we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is completely different from what I had had before. When I was working and before I married I lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and historic old houses and things like that. So I tried to. I was in the process of renovating a house that was about seventy-five years old. So it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint. Everything you can think of that house had to have. You are experienced I would say. <SEP> I really did enjoy it. It was amazing what I found out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it. I agree. <SEP> I have done something like that too only not nearly as extensive. But it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home. After having a one that was historical looking. <SEP> It is. It is. <SEP> That's true. When I met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time. And the town that I was living in only about eighty miles from here. So we. Really it was just. The market was so good. We hadn't really planned on buying. And as you probably heard in the Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal. You can get things for such a song. <SEP> So that's really why we ended up in a house like this. This is not what we want to stay in forever because I've found that after doing this other house I have to have my hands into stuff. And I'm always just wanting to paint and wallpaper and redo and redo. So I'm ready to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into. So. Maybe you can make that one charming and make a little bit money. <SEP> That's the key. The thing is when we moved in they had just painted wallpapered new carpet and everything. So I feel sort of like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because I'm in the mood to do it. So we'll see how much longer we're here. We just moved to Charlotte from Enid Oklahoma. <SEP> Oklahoma of all places. So I know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned. <SEP>. <SEP> And I'll tell you we had kind of a charming house. It was a cedar shake house and very weathered. And it was about fifty years old but not really traditional looking particularly. <SEP>. <SEP>. So I tried to make it after I sold my business. I in. I spent almost three years redoing. <SEP> And I considered it a full time job. It is. And when we did. We kind of had planned this trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country. <SEP> I see. And so I think some of the things that I did paid off. For instance one thing that I did that might even be a good suggestion for you was something I did on the outside. <SEP>. I love old estate sales. <SEP> I happened to go to just a little estate sale just a little white frame house where the couple was very old and had gone into nursing homes. <SEP>. And all the men started going down to the barn. <SEP>. And so I th-. I'm going. <SEP> That's where I need to go. I'm going to the barn too. They auctioned some tools and things like that. <SEP>. But then they went over and started auctioning this big stack of bricks. <SEP> And so I thought I've been wanting to do some brick walkways for a time. <SEP> Work. Anyway it ended up after some pretty heavy bidding that I got all those bricks for forty dollars. <SEP>. And so my husband and I loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days. <SEP>. But what we ended up with was about four thousand. <SEP> For forty dollars? For forty dollars. And so what we did. We had built a deck on the back of that house. <SEP> But it needed. And it was quite large into the yard. Something. <SEP> But on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together. So we made brick patios and walkways. <SEP> How fun. How nice. And so for. And he did the digging which was about six inches. <SEP> But I figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and placed most all the bricks. <SEP>. <SEP> And it turned out beautifully. I bet. And what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way. It nearly killed me. <SEP> But you did stagger back and say doesn't this look nice. I hated to leave it. Let me ask you. When you laid those bricks. I know my parents bought a house about ten years ago. They're fixing to sell it again and move again. They're kind of. My mom's like I am. She's a renovator a lover of old things. <SEP> And they have to be doing something constantly. And the patio that came with that house was not laid on a. I don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something on top of the sand and then lay the bricks. We. But they have a problem with these little sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks. I. <SEP> And of course you have the weeds that come up in between the bricks and things like that. I didn't have that trouble because we laid the. I did get some material and studied every bit of material that I could study. But we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them. <SEP> I see. Because when you start. And we put them on a base of four inches of sand. <SEP> And then we swept sand in between. But it was an error to leave an eighth of an inch or whatever. You just put them together as close as you can. <SEP> As tight as you can. That's probably because they had. Every spring my mom says we're going to have a barbecue and tell everybody guess what. We're going to redo the patio. We're going to pull up all the bricks. But they just haven't brought themselves to do it. <SEP> So. And I also used a rubber hammer a lot to. <SEP> If it wasn't quite level or something I'd just get that rubber hammer and prob-. I think that they could. If they have problems with sand bugs of some kind I think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a fairly regular basis for a while anyway. <SEP>. <SEP> The thing that's funny is they've done things like that. I'll catch her out there spraying around. And then it's like in two days time they'll come home from work. And those little things are back. It's just they're the most resilient little characters. And so I don't know what they're finally going to do. She may just. Hopefully they'll sell the house and go somewhere else. <SEP> I think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are. And then she won't have to worry about it. And. <SEP> What are these things? Is it diazinon. Or what is it that will. Dursban or something like that. <SEP> What it is that'll take care of them. Dursban. I think in this area or most all areas they use for ticks and fleas. <SEP> And they're awful hard to do anything with. <SEP> That's true. That's true. But my dad farms. And she's always telling him isn't there something that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs. But. I bet Dursban would do it. <SEP> It might do it. She's got just a gorgeous yard so many flowers and her four cats. So she's sort of real funny about what she sprays. I think you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very well before she lets her cats out or something like that. <SEP>. <SEP> Deb we could talk all day couldn't we. I know. It just seems. As I said when I heard what the subject was I thought I haven't thought about what I went through at that other house in so long. I've been so busy. But I don't know. Of everything that I did I guess I enjoyed probably wallpapering the most. And I thought that would be the hardest thing to do. <SEP> But I ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house up the stairway even. I just had a ball with it. <SEP> It was so much fun. Good. And I've sworn up and down. My mom's great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris Texas. And the one thing that she ended up with was the old door that was on the front door of that house. <SEP> And she has that up in her attic. And I have sworn that it. I'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does. <SEP> So as far as looking toward the future that's my plan. I'm going to have to move fast though because as a.
