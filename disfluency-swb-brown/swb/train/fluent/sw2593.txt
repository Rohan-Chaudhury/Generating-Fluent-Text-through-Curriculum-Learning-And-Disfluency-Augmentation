The topic is hobbies. In your spare time. Who has spare time? <SEP> I don't really do any handicraft things like that. I used to. I used to do salt ornaments and things. But that was good many years ago. And I really my spare time. <SEP> I usually go do aerobics and read. And that's about it. <SEP> I understood that. I work full time. And I have two kids. So my spare time usually involves something with the kids. Hobbies. I can't really say that we have hobbies. It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend. We like to go out. <SEP> Family. That's what I meant by salt that we did that as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it. During the Christmas season making them up for other people and things like that. <SEP> But as far as. I've just never been very skilled at far needle work cloths. <SEP>. And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good. <SEP> And. I guess mostly as far as crafts go I've done some needlepoint. I've done mostly cross stitching. I used to do. One that I did for both kids are. They're plaques with different kind of animals. And then you have their birth date on them. <SEP> And then you have a little picture of them. And you frame them and stuff. But nothing steady. Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it. But it's nothing that I can really. It's not like you sit and knit every night. <SEP> Not at all. I don't even know how to knit. And my mother used to knit all the time. <SEP> And I don't even know how to knit. I'm that's a lost art from this family. <SEP> But it's not a very good topic. It feels like if. Not when you're n-. Neither one of us are really. I have seen things I really like that were done especially like needlepoint. <SEP> Needlepoint cushions and things. But it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it and that the petty point and things like that. <SEP> It seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made. I don't know what. It's like there. But here a lot of the country stuff is in a lot of the woodwork a lot of stenciling. <SEP> And you can go to a flea market and stuff. And there's just tons of stuff everywhere. And people just do it in their garage. And then on weekends they go out and sell it. And during the week they go back and do some more. And they do that as their job. Whereas for us it. <SEP> And they make it cheaper for us to buy. And I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that. Because I can remember when I used to do those figurines and things. It was relaxing creative. You felt very creative. <SEP> But it just was so much time involved and the different steps and things. <SEP> And. I think we're okay. I think we did the five minutes. So we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore. <SEP> Thank you. I hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
