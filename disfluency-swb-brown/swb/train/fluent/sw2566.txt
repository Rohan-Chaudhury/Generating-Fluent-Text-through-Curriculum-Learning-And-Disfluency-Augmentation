. Do you have any children? I don't. <SEP> You don't. Do you? I have one. A five year old daughter. <SEP> Did you ever have her in child care? I do. She was at a private. I stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born. And then I had her at a private sitter for two two and a half years after that. <SEP> And how did you choose that sitter? She was referred to me by a couple of people. And she turned out to be wonderful. I couldn't have asked for anything better I don't think. I didn't want to send her straight to a day care. <SEP> And even though she was that old I still didn't want her to go to a day care. And this lady you would think it was her own. <SEP>. She's real good. It's hard to find people like that. It is. And now I have got her in a Montessori school. <SEP> And she's really really doing good and learning a lot. And actually I've started working up there in the afternoons too. <SEP> That's neat. Y-. I guess. I'm going to quit as soon as the school season's over. But I really enjoyed being with her up there. I hate it for her. She has to stay that much longer. But. <SEP> Do they have classes for them during the summer too? They go year-round teach them. Now in the summer they have a lot of field trips. <SEP> There's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one and stuff like that. It's a lot more lax. But they still go through all their curriculum as usual. What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there? I ca-. My husband and I both went. We kind of give her the third degree. <SEP> I'm glad to hear that. We went over to her house. So we told her pro-. We just told here we'd be over that day. We didn't tell her when. So that way I didn't think the house would be cleaned or anything for me specifically. <SEP>. And she had a daughter. And I want to say her daughter was six or seven right around first second grade. And at the time she kept one other child about a four year old. But it was only a part-time basis. So we went over there. And we questioned her about what she fed them and what she did with them during the day and just how she treated them how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that. <SEP> And we really seem to be pleased with her. And. Did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision? <SEP> And she still loves her to death. When they see each other they just love each other to death. And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter. Either making her clothes or buying her things. <SEP>. <SEP> So we're real real lucky. But aft-. So she stayed with her about roughly two years. And she had to go back to work. They had some other expenses that came up. So she had to go get a real job. Get a real job full time. So. <SEP> So what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school? I checked a lot of places out the Kinder Cares and the stuff like that. And I live in Garland. <SEP> And there's this Montessori school that's nearby. And it had been recommended by some friends of ours. But it's an older place. And so I checked out all the new places that were near us. And then I checked that place out. And even though it was older it was real comfortable and kind of homey. <SEP> And they didn't just play all day long. I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went and or interviewed at they did a lot of play work and stuff. And then they. Almost all of them had a Montessori section. And I thought that must be pretty good if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into their school. <SEP>. And they made sure they pointed it out. But after I looked at this place and I took Randi with me just about to every place. One place I think I didn't take her. <SEP> And I just kind of let her go see what she felt like doing. And that place. If somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them. <SEP> So I felt more comfortable at that place. That's the true test. <SEP>. And she was real comfortable. And she has really really done good. I. It's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her. <SEP> But she seems to me to be pretty quick and smart. And she's already reading and writing and stuff like that. That's good. And she just turned five last month. <SEP> That is good then. I think so. I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time. But. <SEP> Especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years in school. Exact-. I wanted to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months because I know she's going to have to face that. <SEP> <SEP> And. Here we go. That's right. I just hate that. But. So you don't have any children. Do you have any nieces or nephews then? <SEP>. I have a nephew. He's a little brat. He goes to a really crummy day school. My sister's not real bright. But he's always sick. He has always got some kind of cold or something. <SEP> And I don't know. I don't think this place is a very good place for him. It's just kind of convenient. And she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else. Just easy to get them there and stu-. <SEP>. That's a shame. <SEP> I don't think she checks things out very well. Which really surprises me. That's scary. <SEP> It is scary. I was petrified. I know. <SEP> I would be too. That's. I don't know. That's just it. And that's why I don't mind paying more. I don't know. I just feel m-. <SEP> Too many horror stories out there that. And that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is because I know what's really going on. <SEP> That's right. I think that's an ideal situation. Because you don't know. Because at her school as soon as you drive up it's got a circular type drive. They sit. And they have car callers. And some kid goes out and gets the kid. And it's time to go. <SEP>. At first that always kind of bothered me. Not bothered me. But I thought I'd like to see what she's doing. <SEP> But now that I'm there it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle. When their parents come. <SEP> And it's hard to get them out. And a lot of parents have places to go and things like that. That's right. And it's late at night. So now it doesn't bother me at all. But. <SEP> Is that where the. Over there off of. I'm not sure what the street is. Is it near Country Club. And all. Sixty-six. That one that's set back in the woods? <SEP>. <SEP> I've seen the signs. That's it. But I've never actually seen the place itself. <SEP> It's pretty set far back off the road. It w-. And that's something I like too. <SEP> Because a lot of those places are like the one over here on seventy-eight Skaggs. <SEP> That little Kinder Care whatever it is? It's right there on. Which this is on a highway too. But it's set back enough to. <SEP>. There's a difference. I would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out. Or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could go in and get one. <SEP> Ye-. <SEP> That's right. Or a car accident. And that was one of the places I had checked out. <SEP> And it was brand new when I checked it out. And of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there. But I that. <SEP> I didn't base everything on that. <SEP> Because that all wears off. That's right. That's exactly right. You get some kids in there. And it's over quick. <SEP> But I've been real pleased knock on wood. I'm scared to death her going to public school. <SEP> I don't know. I w-. I do know why because drugs and everything else. I would be too. <SEP>. And they talk about how soon they start that. <SEP> And that scares me. I know. It is scary. You're just with them. <SEP> Do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs? They've had police officers come in and talk to them about it. But of course they still have no concept of what in the world drugs are. <SEP>. But. <SEP> And what to do when they're faced with it. But I just think of her. Next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with ten year olds. Isn't that sixth grade. And that's a big gap. <SEP> It is. And I can honestly see the peer pressure there. And that just terrifies me to death. And stuff. <SEP> I can see it too. Those kids getting snatched. And I'm probably a little too over protective. <SEP> But nowadays you have to be. Nothing wrong with that. <SEP> You do. If. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I at first thought when I didn't have kids. I was going how can you be so protective? <SEP> But it's easy now. Now you understand. <SEP> That's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own you'll understand. That's exactly right. And I do. <SEP> But. Are you married? Are y'all planning on having kids? Or. <SEP> We'd like to. That's good. Because they're really neat. It's just.
