I think I get most of my news in headlines from the radio. And then I follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention. I do about the same but in a different fashion. I'm from New York originally. And now that I live in Florida. I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the summertime. <SEP> And I feel that the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES. I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger. And I try t-. Now that it has a national edition I read that. I guess I do watch MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I lean to that coverage. <SEP> And I guess I'm. I like them. But they take so long. I don't always have time. <SEP> There. It's a whole hour show. Actually it's an hour show each evening. And we turn it on when we start dinner. We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up. I find that I'm leaning on. I travel a great deal even overseas. And I find that I lean on C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff. And I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out. I don't believe everything they say. But it's coverage. I think C N N does a pretty good job. I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad until the Gulf War. <SEP>. And they seemed to have the best coverage. They had more information sooner than most of the other networks. <SEP> I. Peter Arnet was reporting direct from Iraq. I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him. <SEP> I think he reported what he saw. And if you didn't like it that was just too bad. I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted. But I think they said that frequently enough. That you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective. <SEP>. <SEP> That's right I think so. And I guess when it comes to magazines I don't read. I used to when I was younger. I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper. Or I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS which is a magazine that only talks about other excerpts from the WORLD PRESS. Which sort of gives you a different slant than. It's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper. <SEP> But that and the radio. I listen to P B S radio a lot. And I also listen to these twenty-four hour news stations when I'm driving. I. We have a C B S twenty-four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work. And. <SEP> Do you read. Are you from Southern or Northern California? Northern. I'm from the peninsula. <SEP> What is that. Palo Alto. The San Francisco paper out there is the major paper? <SEP> It's horrible. And that's a terrible paper. The San Francisco paper is just wretched. <SEP> So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS. Is that pretty good? Palo Alto is about midway between. It's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper. And. <SEP> What is that the CHRONICLE isn't it? There's the CHRONICLE and the EXAMINER. But they're both run by the same peo-. <SEP> They really are probably the worse papers I've ever read. I. They're just horrid. So we read. <SEP> Can you get the L A paper up there? That's a pretty decent paper isn't it. Or. We can. But I don't like it. So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and MERCURY NEWS. <SEP>. <SEP> That's another one I read. I forgot that. I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL. Not as in depth as I used to because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer. But. Again I read that two columns on the front. <SEP> I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff. I feel pretty well versed in what I'm doing because I do spend more time on that than I do on sports. I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now today. And I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the news coverage. <SEP> If anything I think they list-. We almost have too much. I don't know. I hear a lot of criticism about listening to the Dan Rathers of the world and taking their word for it or their comment. Actually I think they slant things. But. I can not stand Dan Rather. <SEP> I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston. No kidding !. And I hated him then. <SEP> I didn't know that. And I would not watch that man for money. And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach. <SEP> Was he. So I watch Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw. Sort of alternately. <SEP> How do you feel about it? I guess I got to say if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to. I don't know. If it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped. Do we get enough news or something like that? To. Do we get the news that we want? <SEP> And I do. I really think. I think I do too. I think you got to segregate some of it. <SEP> That's about all I have to say. Nice to talk to you. Nice talking to you.
