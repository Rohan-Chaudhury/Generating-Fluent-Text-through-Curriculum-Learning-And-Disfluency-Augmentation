Credit cards. I'll tell you what I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I tore mine up. <SEP> Is that right? I know some other people that have done that. I got in some financial problems because of credit cards. So I basically just got rid of all of them. I have a couple. I have a gas card that I use just for gas and one that I use just for emergencies. <SEP> But. We have some friends that did exactly the same thing. They kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed. And finally they realized that they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole. And they just cut them all up except for one they kept for emergencies. And they're still paying away to get out of debt. <SEP> I know it. But. I did just the opposite. I guess I sort of followed in my parents' footsteps. I have quite a few of them. I use them continually. <SEP> But I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for. And I always pay them off totally every month. Is that right? <SEP> That's a good policy. And they're just a convenience for me. I don't have to get cash out of the bank. And I don't have to be writing checks. And. <SEP> Sometimes I wish I had them. But in most cases I'm glad I don't because unfortunately I don't have the control you have. <SEP> I wish I did. But I don't. And it. I just don't want to get into that situation again. So we'll. <SEP> It's easy. You don't have anything transferring just a little signature. So what. That's it. And that's. Even with my gas card I find that I'll go in to get some gas. <SEP> And I'll end up buying candy and drinks and sweets and whatever. And then at the end of the month I get a bill. And I'm thinking what did I get that costs so much. <SEP> Surprising. <SEP> And. But the. <SEP> There are some inherent limits there. You're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that. That's true. But I can certainly understand where. Now I. You know. <SEP> W-. The thing that probably helps me most doing that is really not so much discipline. You have sort of a discipline in general about finances. But I hate their interest rates so badly that I. Isn't it. That's unbelievable. <SEP> How. Let me ask you this. How old are you? I'm thirty-three. Thirty-three? <SEP> Thirty-two. Excuse me. You'll be thirty-three this year? <SEP> You want to be thirty-two as long as you can. It's coming. <SEP> I know what you mean about the interest rates. It's unbelievable. That just irritates me so much that I refuse to pay them interest. And my wife recently decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off. And she's from there and didn't really have the money. <SEP> But she could pay it off. And so I sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards. But she's paying it. And I just won't do it. She's paying I don't know what per month forty fifty dollars per month in interest. <SEP> And I just refuse to give it to them. If I need to borrow that kind of money I'll go to the bank. And. And then you bet. <SEP>. That's. In fact I've even heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less rates and have paid off their higher interest rate cards and just sent them back. Income. <SEP>. <SEP>. And I guess there's some negotiating there too. Because I heard. On one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and said what you can do is call. If you've got a pretty good credit rating you can call wherever you got your card from and tell them either drop my rates or drop my annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else. <SEP>. <SEP> High. I might. And if you've got a pretty good history with them they're more than willing to do that. <SEP>. <SEP> I might try that because I have one card that I've had for about nine or ten years. In fact that's what this guy. He wrote a book on it. And he says he's tried it with several of his cards. And he's just told them I can get this card from this bank at this rate. And yours is at eighteen or nineteen percent. <SEP> It does not make sense for me to do that. And if you won't drop my rates I'll just go ahead and send you back your card. And I'll go somewhere else and get it. For me the big thing is the annual fee. And I just refuse. I won't get any card now. I've got a good rating. And I've got. <SEP> And I'm not going to pay an annual fee. The only one I actually pay on is this one that the very first.
