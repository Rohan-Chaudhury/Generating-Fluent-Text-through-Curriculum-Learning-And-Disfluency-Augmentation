What kind of car would you like to buy next? I guess Cadillac. I guess that's kind of everybody's dream. Why would that be? <SEP> I guess it's a General Motors product. And I like General Motors because they're made in the United States. And we've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them. That's good. If you had no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy? <SEP> I think I'd still go with the Cadillac. Do you? I don't care about a big fancy. Which type of Cadillac is your favorite? <SEP> I don't know. I guess the Seville or. The Seville. That's a sharp looking car. <SEP> That really is. It always has been though. They have been. It doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness. It never really has. It's always had it's own unique look. <SEP> I've always liked that. I liked the. A couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it. I thought that looks sharp. <SEP> That looks real sharp. I think the ones now with all of the fancy gold lettering and all I think they're very pretty. <SEP> And course a vinyl top I think those are pretty. And the. I've never ridden in one recently. But they're supposed to be just real smooth. Just a nice comfortable ride. <SEP> They are. And they're just always. They look like they're sturdy. They look like they're very sturdy. And you don't have to worry that much about getting hurt like you would in a small one. Now they've got a unique feature in them now. If you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't go into the inside. It'll go underneath the car instead. <SEP> I didn't know that. So that's a big safety factor they've got in them now. And I suppose they all have the balloons. The air bags. <SEP> The air bags. That's great. That's great. You say you've always have preferred General Motors products. <SEP> I do. I go for things built in the United States rather than foreign countries. Help our economy. And. What kind of General Motors cars have you had in the past? <SEP> Mostly Oldsmobiles. Oldsmobiles. Those are real nice riding cars too. That's what we have now. But of course if I have a choice I'd still have the Cadillac. But I've been very satisfied with the Oldsmobiles. <SEP> We've driven them for about probably twenty years. Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra? The Ninety-Eight. The Ninety-Eight. <SEP>. I don't think. Let's see. The Ninety-Eight. That's got that big V eight engine in it doesn't it? I don't know. The one we have has a six. Has a little V Six? <SEP>. But it's a very good car. It's not had one minute's problem with it. It. <SEP> And now I have twenty-three thousand miles on it. That's great. That's great. That's always nice to get reliability in a product. Especially when you're spending anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for a single item. <SEP> You just don't want any hassles with it. You expect it to do its job. And I think a lot of car manufacturers don't take that into consideration. <SEP> That's true. They just expect you to buy their product. But that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car going to be. <SEP> Price is an issue. But it's not the most important issue. It really isn't because now you can get five year financing on them. And. <SEP> But I would go with the General Motors any time. I've always been a Ford man myself. <SEP> But that's all right. It's American made too which is good. <SEP>. But I've. Ever since I was growing up my dad's always had Fords. And I grew up in South Dakota. So everybody has a truck. <SEP> And my Ford trucks have just. I've just never had problems with them. I honestly think I would die before my truck would keel over on me. <SEP>. <SEP> I. Those are good products also. Let's see.
