Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel. And then I'll respond. I'm very guilty of not doing my part with recycling I'm afraid. We recently moved here from North Carolina. And they had curbside recycling. And it was very easy to put everything out there. But we don't have it at least in our neighborhood right now. <SEP> So I've been very guilty about not making the effort to take things where they belong. How long have you been here? We've been here since January. So we still feel very new. <SEP> But it's working up to a year now. So I guess we're old timers compared to some people. I think that's a good excuse. You need to get into the system a little more and know where to take things. <SEP>. We've been here probably two and a half years. And we didn't recycle at all before we came. <SEP> So I think we're doing well. We save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now. <SEP> Where do you take those things? The glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart. In behind Walmart they have bins. And then we usually save up our cans and change them in for money. <SEP> Where do you do that. Because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir. But I didn't know where to take them. There's a place on Parker Road. It's just over the overpass before you get to K-Mart. I think there's a service station there. There's usually a semi truck that has a person there that will weigh them. And they aren't worth much right now. <SEP> But it's better than nothing. So. <SEP> Better than nothing. And what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the pickup now. And hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October. I. It seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that it's coming in a couple of months. And I think it's been delayed. <SEP> But. I think it was originally scheduled for February. But the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with from what I've read in the mail that we get. <SEP> And I can't wait for that. That will be easy. I get tired of newspaper littering the garage. It gets to be a bit much to haul it off. But. I feel guilty we don't recycle our milk containers because they seem like a big waste. <SEP> They're a lot of bulk anyway. They fill up the whole kitchen garbage can. <SEP> So I'll be glad when the bins do come. And I think that's when I'll start doing the plastic too. It was real easy with the bins. It really was. It was just no effort at all no more trouble than taking out the garbage. So. I've gotten used to washing the salad dressing bottles and things like that. <SEP> It's not that big of a deal. And it's nicer to just throw them out. But we can do our part take an extra minute or two. <SEP> How much do you earn on the cans. I didn't know what kind of an idea to give her for. When we first were here it was like we'd take maybe a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full. And it would be two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar. <SEP> So it's gone down. <SEP> Which is understandable. I think more people are recycling. <SEP> That's something we don't really make any effort to. And whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter the cans. And that was kind of fun. But we haven't done that for a long time. <SEP>. That sounds like a pretty good project. The boys think it's fun plus you get your exercise. And you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest. <SEP> <SEP> But. I'll have to keep myself and get on it. My neighbor across the street is so careful about recycling. And so I keep telling myself I'll get it organized. But maybe they'll beat me and do the city wide first. Hopefully the bins will be here in this month. And that will spur you on. So. <SEP> I won't have any excuse then. That's for sure. It sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting Trying. Thinking about it anyway. That's all you can do. <SEP> But have you. Do they time this thing for us. Or do we. You can do it as long as you want. They. If it's been long enough five minutes is when they cut in and say we don't have any more room for recording. <SEP> You can't chat all day. So we can say good-bye now. It was good talking to you. And maybe we'll get on line again. <SEP> Sherry.
