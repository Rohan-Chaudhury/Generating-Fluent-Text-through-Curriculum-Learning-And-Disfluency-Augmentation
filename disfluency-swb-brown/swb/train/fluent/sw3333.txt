. I've never done it before. So I guess that's all I have to do. I guess so. I've been called several times. And I pushed in my number. They kept saying you have the invalid code. <SEP> And then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right. So this is the first time I've even done it. <SEP> I wonder how long it's going to be on for. I think five minutes is the max. I mean this whole thing for two months or something. Do you know? <SEP> I don't know. Back to crime. I guess we're supposed to talk about that. They say what aspect are you worried about. I think at this point I for one am worried about every aspect. <SEP> Especially you since you're in the same metroplex. There's so much going on here. I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that's really something you got to protect yourself from. That and in the schools too starting to put metal detectors in. I know. <SEP> And. Have they done that in Garland? I. Not that I'm aware of. <SEP> I just heard last week at that one school they started putting them in because there was that one shooting. So. We had a vice principal shot at here last year on the school grounds after school. <SEP> Is that right? And the one boy killed himself a few years ago in a grade school. So these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any neighborhood doesn't seem like. <SEP> Not at all. It's kind of scary to think you send your child to school. And you wonder if he's going to get shot. We didn't have to worry about that before. <SEP> I know. What next? I know. It's getting. It's been out of hand for a while. And it just continues to get worse. And we can't really depend on the police to solve all this. They just can't do it. <SEP> I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent. And how we going to bring that back together. <SEP> That's. I thi-. I agree. I think that's where it stems from is that and you've got a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children. And. <SEP> And that may impact it as well. I think so. And then there's a drop in the training of morals really. Some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all. <SEP> I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood. They don't think twice about it. <SEP> Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the. I think it was just rare. I really do. <SEP> My mother. When she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in California. And she was dating this millionaire's son. And he wanted to marry her. And she wouldn't marry him. And so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both. And. You're kidding. I'm the one. <SEP> Himself and her? That must have been at least fifty years ago or more. But the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks. <SEP> I bet. But now you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas. I know. It's just another killing. <SEP> They were. I was watching some show the other day. And they were talking about mass murderers. And they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently. And they were saying that these guys want attention and that when it happens they're glorified because it's on all the newspapers and T V -s and everything. <SEP>. <SEP> Lots of their picture and life story and everything. And then you get to their life story. They came from a broken family. <SEP> This person had mental problems. <SEP> I know how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible. So that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin the same thing happened here in Arlington to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with. <SEP> Is that right? I think it was on a Hard Copy. She was a real attractive blond girl in her freshman year of college. And some boy she tried to get rid of he was in his twenties. <SEP> I remember seeing that. Remember that? I saw that on Hard Copy. That's. <SEP> My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School. Is that right? Can you believe it. That's just. <SEP> I'm trying to remember. He had her in the car in front of a Taco or something. Taco Bueno. And he just shot them himself and her. <SEP> I remember seeing that. Isn't that weird? <SEP> There's just too many crazy people out there these days. I know. And the police are not going to do anything until they've committed some sort of a crime. He was just begging her on the phone. That's not doing anything. And there are times I think I should give my kids gu-.
