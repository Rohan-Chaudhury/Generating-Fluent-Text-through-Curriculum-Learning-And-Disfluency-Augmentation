Do you keep a family budget. Or do you have some. I don't use a family budget. My father who is very old has kept one his entire life. <SEP> And I probably rebelled against it. I probably should have kept one. He keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage. Interesting. <SEP> We sort of started doing it years and years ago. And my husband started graduate school when we were first married. And I sort of just got in the habit. And never have gotten out of it. I can not really say that it's a formal budget. It's more just a fairly accurate recording of what I spend and what I think I am going to have to spend. And. <SEP> I think it makes much more sense. And I have recently gotten out of debt and everything. And I will probably start keeping a little better track of it. <SEP> I just spent whatever came in and never knew what came in and what went out. About like the government runs. <SEP>. That sounds real similar. <SEP> So I think it is probably better to have at least a record. But my dad was so precise that if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent. And that was put over there. <SEP> And of course he is from the depression. So it's his life. <SEP> But I think it would be smart if somebody would keep some sort of a plan that works for them. I think you are right. It must have been sort of interesting to us. It's because since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years I can go back and look. And it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years. It is. For instance. <SEP> I'm a historian. And my father had kept them since nineteen twenty-seven. But he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-. I could not believe he did that. So I took the ones from fifty-two on to the present. <SEP> But to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that. <SEP> But. As a matter of fact my mother was going through some things not long ago. And she came upon a budget book that she had back in the thirties. When they. It was the late. I guess it must have been in the forties because they had been married probably fifteen years at the time. And it was just fascinating to see how little things cost. It was just almost laughable in some instances that. <SEP> Of course it's all relative of course. I know. But never the less it was fun to see those figures next to. For a pair of shoes was like five dollars. And. <SEP> I know. Even in nineteen sixty-three. I found a record that I had what I had paid for hotels. And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now. <SEP> And I paid between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty. Isn't that something. <SEP> And that's really crazy. Cause that's about thirty years ago. That is really something. But of course it's just what the market will bear. That's true. <SEP> If people will pay two hundred then why charge ten. That's right. That's just good old economics working. <SEP> We have tried to instill some sense of budgeting in our kids. But our two children are just as unlike as night and day. And our son could care less about a budget. And our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost just sounds like your father. <SEP> She has everything planned so closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop. <SEP>. Then you never know how they will. One. They may flip flop when they get to be older. <SEP> The other one may be very careful. <SEP> And she may marry somebody. And of course it would be good because it you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching. You should have one in the house. I think that is true. I. And I think that is probably what happened in our house. <SEP> And I think. Because I think my husband was not quite as good at saving and so on before we got married. And I was really diligent about that. I was putting money aside before I was married when I was working out of college. And that really paid off. Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts. And. <SEP> That's about the way it is here. If it had not been for my wife I would have probably been in debtor's prison if we had one. <SEP> But what does you husband do now? He is an engineer. He is an electrical engineer. And in fact went through many years of graduate school and got his P H D. <SEP> So we had a lot of years of budgeting. <SEP> You have to do it when you are in school. And. <SEP> When you. My wife is still in school getting her doctorate. <SEP> And it. I'm working on my master's degree now. And I have got. So in fact this last year we had three. Both of the children were in college. Our son has a year left. And our daughter graduated this year. And I'm just about ready to finish my master's degree. <SEP> So we have had once again a real lean year for us. I know. We had three in college plus my wife. But. <SEP> So that was four. So we were both in the same. You know exactly what it's like then. <SEP>. And it's. Which you learn. I guess you figure that that is an investment that is really invaluable. <SEP> That is the best one. With education you can't take that away from you. <SEP> That is right. It's one that you can live through. And I think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel. That it was worth it to save and to not have something and in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it. <SEP> So it really makes it easier. That's true. But I have enjoyed talking with you Jerry. <SEP> I have enjoyed talking with you Kathy. And I wish I could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me. I am interested in that. If I had your address I would send you. I am also in the travel business. I do tours. <SEP> And I can take some real great tours to Europe. So if you. My husband and I just went there last year. Actually we did not take a tour. We were in England and went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and did it on our own. <SEP> But I. That sounds interesting. Is your business in Dallas then? It's here in Dallas. <SEP> In the Quorum. I'm Jerry Hammond. And I'm out at Brookhaven College. So you could just holler at me there. You are kidding. I'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall. <SEP> What is your last name? Kuenzer K U E N Z E R. And I'm. K U E N. Z E R. And I will be in the communications department teaching English One Oh One to. <SEP> Good. I will. I have a couple of sections. I know Zack Miller real well. That's the guy who hired me. <SEP> Wonderful. I will look you up in the fall then. Fantastic. It's been a good type conversation. <SEP>.
