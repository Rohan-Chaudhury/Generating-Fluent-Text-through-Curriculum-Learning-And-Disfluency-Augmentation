. Wonderful touch tone telephone there. What kind of books do you enjoy reading? <SEP> I have a wide variety of hobbies. Therefore my reading pleasures are quite wide. I get a charge out of TEXAS HIGHWAY which is very colorful and not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to find out about the different areas of the state by reading it. I've read that one too. I only had a subscription once. But my mother always gave me hers. And I really enjoyed all the little things that you find out about Texas. <SEP> Absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can set up little trips and day trips and things. It's pretty neat. I like photography magazines. I don't take a subscription or anything like that. Things. Being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of building magazines and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines. And kind of strange because it's not unusual to see an engineering manual or something laying around the house. And then I'll sit up and read just to refresh to keep active on it. But. <SEP> How about yourself? I have an interest in art. So I frequently purchase and read books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment. That's great. And I guess I like a variety of things lots of fiction type books. Right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history. <SEP> That's fairly interesting. I bet that would be rather interesting. That's self improvement. That's kind of a hobby. But it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing. I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement. How about you? <SEP> I hate to. I do. We have these classes we attend management classes. And they give you books. And the last book I read was AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht. It talks about who the customer is and being customer oriented which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments. <SEP> One of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is. So that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is. And as you probably well know all of us are our own customer. You're my customer I'm your customer sort of thing. <SEP> Every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about better outlooks on things and the philosophy of Pat Hagerty and these kind of mind stimulating philosophy type. Which all betters yourself. Maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement. <SEP> They are. But I don't label it as such. Like what for example. I don't know. I have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things. But they would be things on how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. Getting yourself in gear to sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it. <SEP>. How about items like THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER which used to be a big. <SEP> So those are self improvements. Our supervisor subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW. By a man named Doctor Bittel B I T T E L. <SEP> And it's a very layman's approach towards managing different types of people. And the very last chapter is how to manage engineers. So it's interesting. Here again it's casual reading. And it's not eaten up with a lot of mechanical stuff. And it's really excellent fast reading. But as you say sometimes it's difficult to know if it's. I think if somebody would say read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them. <SEP> If he casually just walked into it and put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested. I don't know. I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King. That's a little heavy for me. They're hard to set down because it's so interesting. And of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies. But they're always challenging to get through one of them. <SEP> I have a hard time finishing books. I guess I also have been reading a lot of things on quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work. In quality especially now days that's almost everything that comes across the airways. You could almost label everything quality in some sense or other. But I think sometimes the word is a little over used. <SEP> Exactly right. But. I think we name drop it a little too much and don't fully understand what it is we're saying. I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk. And all that kind of rolls in together there. <SEP> But that's just kind of part of it. Any other comments. Not that I can think of. I think I'm under my quota a little bit. I need to probably make a phone call or two. We just started. <SEP> This is true. I've enjoyed it. You too. And. Have a good day. <SEP>
