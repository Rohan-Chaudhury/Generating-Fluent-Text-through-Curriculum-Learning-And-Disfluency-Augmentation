Michael what do you think about funding for AIDS research? Do you. That's something I've thought a lot about. <SEP> I work in a hospital. And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years. And I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. <SEP> When they asked us did we want to keep it the same or spend more spend less I think right now what they're spending is adequate. For my personal opinion. Because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a vaccine for. <SEP> I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with. <SEP> Or I think they already would have by now. So I don't know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now. I think they're doing as much research as they can possibly do. <SEP> And what about you? I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now. I'm not either. <SEP> I'm definitely not aware of how much. That's something I've never really kept up with at all. <SEP> I'm not sure. I. Go ahead. I know I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research. You know what I mean? <SEP> And that sort of thing. If we were talking about the money I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because I don't know that much about it. <SEP> I can see that research is needed. And. Definitely. <SEP> I think so. I think so. It's becoming a major problem. But. I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on preventing it in more. <SEP>. <SEP> That's true. That's true because it's such an easily preventable disease. And I feel like just saying safe sex is not the answer. <SEP> It's abstinence in certain cases. <SEP> It's definitely not. And. That's true. That's true. <SEP> And knowing. Myself I'm about to get a divorce. <SEP> And course I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything. But it's sort of scary to find yourself single again. <SEP> And because you never know what's going to happen. You don't know who you're going to come across. Course I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see. <SEP> But it's something you got to think about these days. A single person. <SEP> And it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry. <SEP> And. I think for a lot of people it has. Certainly. <SEP> But I know that in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing so that the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything. <SEP> Drug addicts. <SEP> And I don't know. I don't think that's a bad idea. <SEP> I know it sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction. It just sort of keeps that going. <SEP> But I don't know. At least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far can not be. So I don't know. I think that's. I'm not too much against the passing out of the free syringes myself. <SEP> I don't know. What do you think about that? That's a hard issue. It really is. <SEP> It really is. It really is. They gave us a hard topic. I definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed. But as you say people in the meantime. Someone who's not ready to give up drugs. <SEP> That's true. <SEP> That's true. If they're perpetrating the AIDS problem passing that on to each other then. <SEP> I guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first as far as something to do about it. <SEP> So I don't know. Course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another. <SEP> So I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse. Which is the most important to solve at the time. And. <SEP> I don't know. But I've never looked into how much money they're spending. I have no idea. <SEP> And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that. But I really have never looked into it. I have no idea. I haven't either. I've heard different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough. <SEP>. And Mostly that's what I've heard. <SEP> So I don't know. And yet I know it sounds like big money to me. <SEP> But it probably takes a lot. I think it is. <SEP> I think it is. It does every. <SEP> It seems to take more than for any little thing they do. It seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would. <SEP> But. Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that. That's one thing I've never really feared. <SEP> I. A lot of my family they fear me working like that and under some of those conditions. But I don't fear it at all. <SEP> I work in the operating room a lot. And of course when w-.
