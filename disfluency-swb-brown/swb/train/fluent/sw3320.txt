We're supposed to talk about crime in the city. And seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it? <SEP> I. That's. I think it's. Statistics obviously vary greatly. I always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe place. It is. But our crimes up here as I think it must be in most cities now. But I was listening to the news the other day. And they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because so many people are without work nowadays. Economy's so bad. Do you really believe that? It's been up every year for many years. And the economy hasn't been this bad for so long has it? <SEP> That's a good point. That's just what they quoted over the news. I don't know if I believe that or not. But it does seem up. And. <SEP> What kind of newspaper do you get down there? What kind? I think we got a pretty good newspaper. We have two the MORNING NEWS and the TIMES HERALD. <SEP> MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation. I think it's a pretty good. It's a locally owned paper. The HERALD is owned by the TIMES out of L A or somewhere. <SEP> But. Do they play up the local crime angles. Or do they. They don't. Not really. They don't play it up I don't think. But there is too much of it too many homes broken into. <SEP>. We had our fact about. Last year sometime our home was broken into. <SEP> We. So this is a topic of personal interest. We. I didn't think ours ever would be burgled. But so many in our neighborhood had been. And because we live on a corner and back up to a real highly traveled main street. <SEP>. But we were so. <SEP> So you saw this happening in your neighborhood. And you figured it wouldn't happen to you. Sort of. And I never did get a security system. But since that happened I certainly have. What kind of system do you have? It's just a standard. With all the doors and the infrared motion detector. <SEP> Pretty standard. Is this one with some company that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff? <SEP> It's monitored and all that. <SEP> And. Is that a necessary feature to have somebody at the other end of the line. Or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise? I think the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice. <SEP> I really do. But this deal that was part of it for three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever. <SEP> But it. The monitoring is not that bad though. Because we've goofed it up. Several times you'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something. And they call back pretty quickly. So I think it's all right. But I. To answer your question I think that is a pretty good deterrent in itself. Whether it. <SEP> So you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system. And what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line? It's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly. That if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway. Supposedly. <SEP> How does it do that? Who knows. But that's a selling point. And I think it probably does these things supposedly pretty good. They sure advertise so many of them nowadays. <SEP> But don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there? I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's. Down here we seem to. Or not here. But the statistics seem to say that. I don't know. <SEP> I think it's the murder capital of the country now. Is that right? I would gather probably from drugs. <SEP> And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere. But I don't think there's anyplace. Used to. Years ago you thought these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem. But they do. <SEP> We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it as anyone. So what's the solution? That's a good question. I don't know. I don't know what the solution is. I really don't. <SEP> And all these politicians make hay over being anticrime. But they haven't seemed to have changed anything. <SEP> Th-. And nothing seems to change. And I'm not sure that anything will because if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it. But they want to buy it. So. <SEP> Supply and demand. Long as somebody wants to buy it somebody going to provide it for them. So I don't know what the solution is. I really don't. I don't think anyone does in fact. <SEP> What.
