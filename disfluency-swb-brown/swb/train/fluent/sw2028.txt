. How has it been this week for you? Weather-wise or otherwise? Weather-wise. <SEP> Weather-wise. Damp cold warm. Damp. We have gone through what might be called the four seasons in the last week. <SEP> We have had highs of seventy-two lows in the twenties. I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then. It was ninety-six yesterday. <SEP> I heard about that. And we set a record yesterday. And very windy. But then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool. I think right now it's sixty-nine. And that's cool for u-. Or it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant. No rain in the last month I don't think. The ground's very dry. And our yard work everything is in bloom. So our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry. But I guess it also brings about allergies. We're having a lot of allergies down here right now. <SEP> Everything blooming. And the weather. And I think a lot of people have contracted spring fever too. Had a lot of people out at work for fishing and golfing reasons and things like that. <SEP> The blue flu. <SEP> The blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work. As I've said we have had variable weather. <SEP> It has been untypically wet for this time of year. And also we have a lot of green. The grass has been growing. And if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and buy a new spark plug or something along those lines. <SEP> But fortunately it rains. And you do not have to go out and buy the spark plug. But we've had an unusually warm spring. And I guess we're still in winter. And we have had no snow. <SEP> No snow? To speak of. <SEP> We usually average anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter. And this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation. So it's been inordinately warm here for this time of year. <SEP> So in that regard it's fine. But I envy you your ninety-four degrees. <SEP> I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday. It is. Down in the more southern and western areas. And of course we are about two hours from the northern border straight south. And very windy. It's amazing to me. Because I have only lived in Dallas for three years. And I can not believe that the wind blows all the time. <SEP> It does. I. Very seldom if any. I can't remember a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing. I spent six years in graduate school in Indiana. In the flatlands. And it was that way every day. <SEP> Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter. So that. You became accustomed to it. <SEP> But otherwise as I said we have had a relatively mild winter speaking for this area of the country. Where did you go to school in Indiana? <SEP> Purdue. Purdue. I have a brother that lives in South Bend Indiana. And I had to always. I've lived there for eight years myself. I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame. <SEP> But I didn't. You are not from that area originally I can tell. Originally I'm from New Mexico. <SEP> I was born in New Mexico. And we lived in South Bend for eight years and then moved to Tennessee actually. And. <SEP> I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere. Very much. Very much. Cause I spent thirteen years there. And then moved to Dallas about three years ago. So. <SEP> You've moved around as much as I have. My father was in the Air Force. So. I see. <SEP> I worked for the government. So I moved much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years. But I guess this is my first conversation in this series. <SEP> I received a call last night because of the. I had not received my personal identification number. So I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was because I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line. <SEP> Is there any. I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk. It's just as long as you want to. It's just as long as you want to and just a reasonable lengthy conversation. Do you work for Texas Instruments? <SEP> I do not. I work for G T E. And I was sent an application from Jack. <SEP> I've known Jack for some time. I'm in the speech processing business and have been for a number of years. So I was very much interested in being a speaker for this. <SEP> Actually I work for Texas Instruments. And I'm an environmental engineer. I see. And they just published this internally getting people involved. <SEP> That's really strange. I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though. I was saying do we have a TI in Maryland. Or. I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative. <SEP> But I have been a speaker in other similar type of activities. And I know the reason why this is being gathered and the program and so forth. So as I said I was interested in being a speaker. <SEP> We haven't talked much about the weather. I know that's what we're supposed to do. Really the letter just says. Let's see I can't. I was looking at it. I was trying to find out speedy short cuts. And I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and end it when needed. So. <SEP> In environmental engineering. Is that with regard to work place engineering or just the work place environment. Or. It's actually waste water. <SEP> I see. Taking care of. I'm actually in the air division. And we monitor anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building. Or we do have customers that their concerns are in the work place. And we take care of that. But within our department. We take care of everything. Waste water solid waste and recycling and air and. <SEP> I had. The call last evening was supposed to be concerning recycling in the community. The call I received. And so I had thought a little bit about it before hand. <SEP> So I. But that's interesting. I have a friend who is a planner. A city planner. <SEP> And one of his. And he models city districts and so forth does computer modeling. <SEP> And one of the. He gets inputs from an environmental engineer. Actually our division is corporate wide. And we take care of just the Dallas area. Of course we have several plants here. But we do air modeling also. <SEP> I see. And I take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area. What we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information temperature wind speed wind direction. And we have a huge chemical data base. That's interesting. And our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site. And its concentration. And if anything ever happened a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.
