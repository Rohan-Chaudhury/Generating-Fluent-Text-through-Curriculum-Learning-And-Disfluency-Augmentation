The thing is that I. Since I'm in school I don't basically have a monthly budget because I'm living off my dad. But the thing is that I have to keep it under control because for example it's like the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything everything is pretty rough. But he controls that part. But then whenever. It's like once the semester starts I'm the one who has to control how much spending there is. And the only thing that I basically spend my money on is just food. So. What about tuition and rent? Who takes care of that? The thing is that I live in a dorm. <SEP> So what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts. And then the tuition is also the same thing. So the thing is basically that I spend maybe thirty-five forty dollars every two weeks on groceries. And that's about it. But the thing also is that if you want to go out if you want to go to a restaurant or something then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars three times a week. <SEP> You can't do that very often. So it's. For us it's I can spend that money. But it's not what I want to spend it on. Are you working anywhere while you are going to school? <SEP> Because they don't allow me to work since I'm a foreign student. And so the government doesn't allow me to work. <SEP> So all the money comes from home. So you got to make. So how do you keep track of where you are in your monthly spending? The thing is that I basically know how much I have? <SEP> And so the thing is that I can tell. I get all my money out of the teller. And besides one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call international. <SEP> Where do you call to? Argentina. Argentina? <SEP> And so the bas-. One of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills. Talk too long. That's. They want me to call down there every so often. <SEP> I told my dad Dad listen if you want to save money I won't call so often. He goes we want to keep in touch. So I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you. So you call him collect? Because it is more expensive that way. <SEP> What makes you think so? Any. Basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of. <SEP> And because it's considered a luxury in other countries. You just call him direct. And then. Since it's his money anyway. <SEP> And you get the bill and send it to him? I got money to pay that too. So it's basically. It's not too much money. And it's not too little money. So I won't have to rush a letter to him or something. <SEP> Because he really wants me to concentrate on my studies. What are you studying? I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering. <SEP> And what do you think you'll do with that? With those degrees? I can work here up to a year. <SEP> And? And hopefully get a job after that. You want to get into some kind of manufacturing. Or what's the specialty that you're looking for? Computer communications and data transmissions. <SEP> So you want to find a data transmissions. You're looking for long distance type stuff. Anywhere from local area networks metropolitan area networks all that. And so you have a family? <SEP> I have a wife and two children. And. And does your wife work? She doesn't work. She does. It's kind of hard to say now days other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself. <SEP> And she gets paid for that. So she brings some money in. She is trying to start her own business where she does that full time. Alterations and sewing. Stuff for the public. <SEP> And do that on a full time basis here in town. And you have a monthly budget? <SEP> Sort of. We're probably like most American families I guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month. And we know what bills have to be paid. And we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with the monthly budget. So. You don't have any problem in overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that. <SEP> We're like everybody else. We've got several credit cards that sometimes instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time. That's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff. Then that's one of the points which I don't see. I don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas. And I don't like to give any at all. <SEP> Because the thing is that it's like if I want something I'll ask somebody. For Christmas my roommate goes what do you want. And I said I want a backpack. <SEP>. I told him if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack. That's something that you can use. Because I needed a backpack. So he gave me a backpack. And I knew he needed an alarm clock. <SEP> So I bought him an alarm clock. So the thing was that. That's great. Utilitarian. <SEP> But. Necessary things no frivolous gifts. But the thing is especially remember when I was down in Argentina to me it was ridiculous. Because you have to. Once a year you go out. And you spend all this money on all these people. And some you don't care about. It's like. <SEP> That's true. Why bother. But the thing is that. <SEP> Especially being a college student your. I don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving. That effects the budget especially around Christmas time. At the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect. <SEP> What about when you have breaks Christmas or between sessions? For example we had spring break now. And I went skiing. And I spent around maybe two hundred dollars. I expect so. But it's. <SEP> You've got to budget that though. You've got to save up in able to do that? Because it's like we were saying let's go eat out before spring break. I go let's not go eat out before spring break. <SEP> Let's see how much money we have afterwards. And if I felt like I spent way to much then I won't go out. <SEP> And so my roommate went home. I went skiing over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything. But I guess it was worth it. <SEP> Sure it is. Any time you can get away and get away from the daily grind. It was a nice place. Especially if you live on campus and you don't have a car you just go crazy. <SEP> I know the feeling. So let's see how long have we been talking here. Six minutes and a half. Is that okay? <SEP>. Nice talking to you. Nice talking to you. Have a good time. <SEP>
