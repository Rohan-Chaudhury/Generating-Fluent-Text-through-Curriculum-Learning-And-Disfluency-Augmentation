Where are you from Tina? I'm from Maryland. And I have one son who's almost sixteen months old. Are you married or. <SEP> You are. I have two children. I have a seven year old and a three year old. So I try to spend as much time as possible with them. <SEP> That's good. What kind of things do you do? We do a lot of things with them. Taylor my youngest is. Or my oldest is in school. And so she has a lot of school programs and things like that. Was it a big change in your life to have a child. <SEP> It's really nice. My husband is working most of the time. He's working long hours. But I'm staying home. <SEP> I'm just working a couple days a month. And. What do you do during those days? <SEP> We spend a lot of time at the playground. And we go to the zoo. And we go. And we wa-. You said you worked a couple days a month though. What do you do? <SEP> I'm a nurse. Are you? It's real easy to work out my schedule to still stay in with that and to have enough time to spend with Matthew. <SEP>. <SEP> He's just now really starting to get interested in a lot of things. I understand that. They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age. But my wife was. She worked part-time when my oldest was little. And now she's staying home all the time. But that worked out really well because it's a big transition to have children. <SEP> To go from nothing. If you want to do something every night that's fine. But when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore. That's right. And I think a lot of people are realizing that. But still there are so many people that have their careers first. And I think it's really hurting the kids. <SEP> But. I agree with you. I think that my wife leaned that way. And I'm really glad she did. And I'm glad she's staying home. But I know there are some days when she wishes she was back at work. I know. <SEP> That's why I like to work a couple days. I think it gives me a break. That's why I'm glad my wife did too. 'cause she worked either two to three days a week. And that got her out of the house. And yet she'd get to spend three or four days with. <SEP> Most of the time at home. And. We had started out like that. And I think that was really ideal. I do to. I agree. But then when you start having two of them it's a little bit tougher because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff. <SEP> It's. It's difficult. But. Are you from the Maryland area? <SEP> I've lived here forever. I live in Germantown. And. Where are you from? I'm in Dallas Texas. <SEP> In Dallas. I've lived here eight years or so. My wife's from Fort Worth. But. I work for Texas Instruments. <SEP> So that explains. That explains it doesn't it. I don't know. We do a lot of things on the weekends together the family. <SEP> But as far as during the week it's usually just my son and I. And we're. What's your husband do? He works for Coca Cola. <SEP> He manages a plant out here. And it takes a lot of time. I'm sure it does. <SEP> But it. We take walks and go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that. <SEP> But. What. My wife did some teaching at a private tutoring place. A Sylvan Learning Center this year. And so that got me to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff'cause normally if they need something they just go to mom. No matter what it is. <SEP>. I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them. But it's so much easier to go to mom. <SEP> I guess they get used to it. But we'd go to the library and do things like that. But. <SEP> That's good. That's good. I know my husband was real. In the beginning when he was transferred to a larger plant. And he works about an hour and a half away from our home. So it takes him a little bit of time. <SEP> And I'm not able to work during the week because of that. I was working in the evening. And he was coming home. And I could go to work. But their relationship when I was able to work in the evenings really grew. <SEP> He. Just the time that they were spending together. <SEP> I think it really helped to have that time together. It really does. Because I think you grow closer. Was your husband naturally a child. Had he been around children. Or. He has seven other brothers and sisters. <SEP> And we have thirteen grand. His parents have thirteen grandchildren. So there's a lot of kids in the family. And he really enjoys it. <SEP> But right now it's kind of a difficult time. But. And the cost of living here is just so tremendously outrageous. <SEP> It's difficult to do it any other way. I understand. I. It's hard because. Then you're not getting to spend as much time at home. Your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to. <SEP> That's right. That's a tough situation. But then again some. You got to do what you got to do to get along too. <SEP> At least I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home. It. Like I said my wife normally feels that way. There are days when I come home and she says take these kids. I'm getting out. I know. So she's had about enough during those days. But for the most part I've really feel like that's led. <SEP> I know. The way that we- jus-. Like what you said with the cost of living and everything I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary and won't. <SEP> And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially. It has. And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that we need to do something about. But I don't know what. <SEP> I believe that too. And I think the kids are where they need to. They need to really focus on the children in this country. Would you have said that a couple of years ago? <SEP> I didn't even really think about it that much. I was vaguely aware of it. But it wasn't really that important to me. And. It's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child. <SEP> It really does. I. Just the whole. Seeing how you really are forming the mind. In the next year or so you'll see so many instances where he'll mimic something that you've done. And everything I'm doing he's learning from. <SEP> That's right. And you think if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care. That's how they're developing their patterns. And I think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it. That's. <SEP> Or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide. I've seen a lot of people just say he'll learn everything when he gets into. Eventually. <SEP> It's true. But it. I know. Even just this first year that I've been with my son here he's. I can just see how much of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of. <SEP> Plus I think it becomes part of you too. You get to stay home. It's not just for him. But it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too I think. <SEP> That's true. It's been nice talking to you. It's nice talking to you too. Good luck. <SEP>.
