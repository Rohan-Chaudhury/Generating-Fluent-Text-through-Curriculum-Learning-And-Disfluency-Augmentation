Do you have any pets now? I sure do. I have a cat and a dog named Joey. Joey. The dog is Joey? <SEP> The cat is. He's the little boy Pomeranian. <SEP> And we just got a new addition to the family. We also have a fish. It's a mud dog. I beg your pardon. <SEP> It's a mud dog. It's a cross between a catfish and a salamander. Did you all catch it. Or. <SEP> We have a cat Stripper. The mud dog. Did. Did you catch the fish? <SEP> We had a friend give it to us. And it's all alone in that aquarium. We'd like to get him a friend. But we haven't found one yet. So how about you. Do you have any pets? At the present time I have two dogs. <SEP> What kind? An English setter. That's the white dog with the feathers. And it has yellow spots on it which they call liver spots. <SEP> And that's a male. And I have a wonderful female lab black lab. How long have you had them. Quite a long time probably five or six years. And unfortunately the black lab that's a female it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had. An i-. When she was about three years old we noticed that she was having problems limping and so forth. And she has hip dysplasia. <SEP>. And it's in that breed. <SEP> But now I think there are tests that can be conducted to tell whether or not the puppies have it. But I think. I don't know. Apparently they've been so inbred or what. But. <SEP> Is that right? N-. I'm not sure that's the situation. But it. For those dogs that are registered. And if you should have one that also has hip dysplasia you can not breed it. I had no idea. I didn't even know that. But she's wonderful. <SEP> Our dog Joey has a back problem. Ha-. What are the symptoms? He's got a bad back. But he's seven. I guess he's almost eight years old. <SEP> He just. He doesn't. He rolls o-. He doesn't like to roll over. E-. You just. When you touch him a certain way on the back. <SEP> But otherwise he can jump just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way. I have had just wonderful luck with this lab. When i-. Let's see winter before last we would bring her in when it was cold. And she wouldn't. I. The next morning you want to take them out. And she wouldn't. I couldn't get her up without picking her up which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds. <SEP> I bet. Until. If I allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon. Anyway I met my son's college roommate is a vet. And he said let's give her some race horse shots. And in. I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this because you all the time run into people with problems. <SEP> That's when we lived in Oklahoma. So he gave this dog a series of. It's. They give it to race horses to get rid of cartilage. And it's called. Anyway it's a series of six shots once a week. And then I noticed after two shots she was. <SEP> Do you have to give those? I could have. But I can't give a shot. I. Believe me I understand. I took her from Enid Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks. <SEP> And after the second shot she was significantly better. Then I didn't notice any improvement till after the sixth one. And ever since. And he said a booster every year or two maybe every six months or something like that. <SEP> And when I notice in the winter when it's worse it's cold weather and so forth then I have gotten a booster for her. But not many people in this part of the country know anything about. I've had to get it from Oklahoma. They've heard about it. But they've really never used it. <SEP> I've never heard anything about it either. So dogs that get down in the hips. I think German Shepherds do it and probably large dogs. And it's just wonderful. <SEP> Does he get. Is he an inside dog also. Or does he just run out in the backyard? Is he fenced in? We're living now in an area where we're in the woods. And we take walks. I just don't let them go away from me. <SEP> But we take walks through the woods twice a day. That's nice. And I can over do it on her. <SEP> But anyway at least she can go. And she's not limping along and all that. Tell me about your cat. <SEP> Stripper he started out being a little orphan. And we took him in. And he's about two years old now. And he loves his treats. Both Joey and Stripper get treats. And let's see. And is Stripper an inside cat or outside? He's outside. And he's got a way to get in. <SEP> He's got free access of a window we like to keep open. So he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to. Of course. <SEP> That's nice. They. Joey on the other hand is a little different. He has to go out whenever we ask him. And when we ask him he barks. He'll either bark for food or he'll bark to go out. And he'll tell you which one he wants. He's been through obedience school. He just can. He has been trained. And you've kept it up haven't you. <SEP> It is wonderful. I have some neighbors across the field. And they. When we first moved here when the dogs and I didn't fe-. We have a very nice kennel and everything. But since I didn't want to. I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while. So I kept watch and never let them get away. But now every couple weeks one would slip away. And my neighbor said to me I noticed those dogs are so well trained. Anytime they hear your voice they come. So that made me very proud. <SEP> Have we been talking five minutes? I'm not for sure. I'm not either. But. <SEP> I think maybe we have. But. It sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure. Have you ever done this before? <SEP> I haven't ever called. I've put in the paper work I just never made the call. I didn't know if they stop you when the time is up. Or. They don't. I glanced at the clock when we started. And I think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something. But one day I was talking to a lady about gardening. And I love gardening. And she did too. And after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape. <SEP> <SEP> At least you know you did your part. But it's been so much fun too talk. How did you get into this. My best friend in Virginia's daughter is a part of this project in Texas. <SEP> I see. And so she knew that I had the time and would enjoy it. That's true. <SEP> I. But I have a hard time getting anybody because. Do you work. I do. And probably just got home. <SEP> So during the day I me-. I thi-. And I understand also they want men. I was going to tell you the same thing. They're really looking for a lot more men to participate. My husband does. <SEP> Does he. I need to. I've got some applications. I need to hand them out. But this is a great project that they're working on. And it's really going to lead the way for a lot of applications and development in the voice area. I think so too. And I haven't helped them out on men particularly. But my husband probably has made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time. <SEP> I try to make them during the day. But nobody's home. This is the perfect time for me. <SEP> Maybe I'll get you next time. It so much fun to talk to you. Have a good one. You too. <SEP>
