. So you enjoy camping? <SEP> Like you I haven't done any in quite some time except for what I call living now which is very close to camping. <SEP>. <SEP> Is it? I camped in the Boy Scouts. And my dad and I went out sometimes. But even my first eight or nine years of working I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction. <SEP> And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress. When you have to have it you have got to have it. <SEP> And in those kinds of situations room rent which is outrageous. So my buddy and I we just camped. <SEP> And we figured what the hell. We did it when we were kids. And we loved it. Of course we didn't really rough it that much. When I was in high school. He is a couple years older than me. And he graduated and went off to college. And during the summer we would camp out at the lake. <SEP> But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove. I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine. <SEP> And it was fantastic. We would get up in the morning go skiing. That substituted for a shower. And then we would go to work and come back to the boat house at night. And in the afternoon it is still four o'clock. You have got four hours of day light good skiing left. <SEP> And it was great. But now all my life is more like camping than not camping really. <SEP> Do you have electricity out there. You've got a phone obviously. Actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago. <SEP> We didn't have a phone. They didn't have phone lines. You just couldn't get phones. <SEP> And we are third from the end on the electric string. So we are at the end of the mail route. <SEP> Like I said we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas. I guess so. But right now what we did my wife and I is we got a mobile home. One of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed And swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day. <SEP>. <SEP> I'm in construction. And I just had this place to shower up while I was out here putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in. And I came home from work one Friday afternoon. And our truck was back. Everything we had was in boxes. And my wife said we're moving. <SEP> And I said where. And she said out to the trailer. And I said oh. She said yep. And I said okay. So we have been roughing it out here for about three years. But it is not bad. We have color T V microwave. <SEP> It is not horrible. But it's a lot like camping. I grew up in California in central California right in the valley. <SEP> So it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains. So my dad loved fishing and camping. So we would go up. First we went up with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and cooked our hot dogs by the fire or whatever. <SEP> But then later my mom and dad got a camper. So we have kind of moved up. Became civilized. A little bit in the world. My mom goes camping. She takes her motor home. She's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning color T V microwave oven. <SEP> She just. Roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. <SEP> But she has a lot of fun. And mostly it is just a way to. She goes to dog shows. <SEP> She shows dogs. And you can sneak a dog into a motel. But you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel. <SEP> So she takes the motor home. And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing. And she. If he would buy her a motor home. <SEP> So he did. But as far as camping my wife and I have plans to not really camp per se but to drive up the Highway One there in California as soon as we get this house finished. <SEP>. That will be pretty. I am going to need a vacation. <SEP> That's really pretty out there. There are a lot of nice places.
