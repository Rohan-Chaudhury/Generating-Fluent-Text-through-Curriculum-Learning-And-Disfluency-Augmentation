Do you have children? I have a daughter. Do you. <SEP> How old is she? She's only about a little less than two years old. I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to promote a college or anything. <SEP> I've got one that's seven and one that's three. So we started saving. But that's all. Are you planning to encourage your children to go to a particular school? <SEP> No particular school. I think that's really a decision that. That you are going to let them make. They. Help them make in terms of what they are wanting to do. <SEP> That's a big influence I think and not only what you can afford but what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are. <SEP>. <SEP> So you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do. Where did you go to school? University of Mississippi. Was that local or. <SEP> It was within the state. But it was not necessarily local it was. So what's. <SEP> What's the criterion for choosing to go there? At the time I was thinking of going pre med. <SEP> And in the state they had the best pre med curriculum for the state institutions. It was choice between there and a private college that was a bit more expensive. <SEP> At the time we really could not afford it. So I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me. <SEP> It. I enjoyed it. Did you commute everyday then. Or. <SEP> It was a six hour drive. When you said it was quite a way away I did not know that meant you had to drive an hour. Or. It was like another world. <SEP> Basically it was a. Did not get home that often. And at that age it's kind of difficult sometimes. <SEP> Especially if you have not been away a lot that extended. Did you go there straight out of high school? <SEP>. I did not get my degree until later on. So I just finished mine a couple of years ago. And I guess when you have to do it that way it makes your choices a lot easier. But. <SEP> That's true. That's like when I went on to get my master's it was where I was at the time. <SEP> I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled. And I was trying to work. So when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go. <SEP> Which group do you work in in T I? The computer science center. Where is that at? <SEP> North building. I see. How long do you work for T I? About three years. Did you work somewhere else. Sounds like you got your master's before here. Or. <SEP> I have. Actually I came straight from school to here. I see. Cause this was the first real job after getting my degree. After your master's or after your. <SEP> After my master's. I see. My undergraduate degree was not in what my master's was. I see. <SEP> So I made a career change basically. I see. Let's see. I have not. There's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools just like you said. Depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that. So I have not really made up my mind whether to encourage them to go different places. <SEP> Or. One day I would like to the. I like the school where I went. <SEP> And I would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to. <SEP> Or the school where I got my master's at which was a different school. And I liked it almost as well. <SEP> But you know that I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there. I think that's. <SEP> If they want to that's fine but otherwise not. Although I would get quite a break on tuition. Because you went there. <SEP> Because they allow for tuition break for out of state students who children of alumnae. I didn't know that. <SEP> Certain schools do it. This school does. So it. <SEP> I was involved in some alumnae recruiting here in town last year. And it was kind of fun because you are trying to get people interested in your school. <SEP> And they were. This was a college night at a high school in Richardson. And it was. And there were a bunch of kids and a bunch of schools. There were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids. <SEP> It's kind of interesting to talk up your school. Your own school. <SEP> And I was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of our school. And were interested in it. <SEP> We. Situations like that you don't realize until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others. And so I was real real pleased with that. That worked out so well. Did you drum up any interest then. Or that's good. <SEP> I think so. I don't know offhand. But it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there. <SEP> So There was one mother who came by right even before we started who obviously was very interested in getting her daughter in or having gotten her daughter in or something. And that. And she was wanting some more information. But her daughter was. A baton twirler or something. <SEP> And she was letting us know how good her daughter was. <SEP> She had business cards describing her daughter's she had won several different twirling awards and all this. <SEP> And she had these business cards she was passing out. And it was quite a production. I think some parents go a little bit overboard. It sounds like it. I think Richardson is probably one of the places that would definitely.
