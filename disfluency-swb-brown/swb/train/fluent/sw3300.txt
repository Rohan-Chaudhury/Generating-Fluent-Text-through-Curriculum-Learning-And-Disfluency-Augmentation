So we started recording already? I guess. I don't know. It's the first time I've made a phone call on it. So you pressed one? <SEP>. So I guess we're supposed to start talking. What kind of books do you read? I read a lot of Steven King Dean R Koontz some Danielle Steel. <SEP> My aunt got me hooked on those. So I. So it's mostly all novels? <SEP> They're all novels. I'll read some classic too. Like what? <SEP> Like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck. I'll. I like that. I like Steinbeck a lot. A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner. That's one of my favorites. I have never read a lot of Faulkner. <SEP> And this is more of a play or something that it was from that I saw. And I read the book from that. And by the way my name's Bill. I'm from North Carolina. I'm Doug. I'm from Pennsylvania. <SEP> I. Let's see. What kind of books do you like to read? A bunch of stuff fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones. And I don't really like the six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that. I really have to be in the mood. <SEP> I read one maybe once a year. I'm not as. I like Richard Broudigan a lot. <SEP> I've never read anything by him. He's dead now. But he was really a pretty amazing writer. He wrote books that were pretty short and pretty easy to read written at a third grade level or whatever. But they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny. He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA. <SEP> So that's. And I read a lot of non fiction books too. Let's see. I like to read a lot of non fiction history Civil War era and that kind of thing. <SEP> I found that real interesting. I'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now. And that was on T V. What's that? <SEP> It was during Teddy Roosevelt's time. And about a American woman that got kidnapped in Morocco. <SEP> This is when they were having their revolution or whatever. And Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man. <SEP> Surprised me. I had no idea that he was like that. How crazy? Just one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle. <SEP> And it should be a grizzly bear because. Sh-. The grizzly and stuff like that. So it's. I saw the movie. And that's what made me want to read the book. <SEP> Candice Bergen was in the movie. I'm a real big fan of hers. So. I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things. I like to read some of the philosophy stuff. <SEP> Let's see. And even like reading some new age things things that I don't quite believe in. Here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE BODY. I think that. It's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that. <SEP> I'm fascinated by that. I'm fascinated by that. <SEP> That. And even stuff about not ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses. I like. I'm kind of a doubting Thomas. And I like to read stuff like that. Some of it really freaks me out. <SEP>. And I like to read some self help books like. I read DIANETICS once I got past all the gibberish on it. Did you like it? <SEP> It was okay. It took me a while to really get into it. It didn't help me that much. I see. But I think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways. <SEP> Then I. One real interesting book I read recently was when I was looking for a job. I read HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED. And it had real good tips. And it. And I got the job that I wanted by applying the methods that.
