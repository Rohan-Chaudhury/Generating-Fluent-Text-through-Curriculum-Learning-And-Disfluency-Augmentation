How is the weather out there? It's really cold. And supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold. And they've gotten more snow than they've ever had. <SEP> You have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff. How about you guys? It's about same. The usual I think. Nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff. It's good. <SEP> The weather let's see the snow here is different from Utah's. Because I have lived in Utah for like ten years. What part? And. Provo. I was going to B Y U. <SEP> And the snow is really cold. It's really humid. So it seems wetter or something like that. It's. It's more humid in Utah than there? Or there? <SEP> It's more humid in Iowa than Utah. <SEP>. And it seems like when the winds blow it goes right through you. It's really different from Utah's weather. I thought Utah was cold. But I think Iowa is a lot colder. That's how it is in Texas too. Because when it's cold it's really cold. So. <SEP> I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. What's that? I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. So the humidity is what does it. <SEP> I think that's true. Because I noticed when I got here too. Because I'd. When it would snow in Texas we'd be really cold. And we'd have to get really warm. And here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing. And you don't feel super cold. <SEP> That's true. It was weird. So how long ago did you graduate? Or did you. Or. <SEP> I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven. My husband got his doctorate at B Y U. So that's. And so he just graduated this past year. So you just barely moved away? <SEP> We really miss Utah. Do you like it out there? We miss the mountains. You do? <SEP> Because it's really flat here. Not flat but hilly. But no big mountains or anything. So you just moved away a year ago? <SEP> In August. Really recent. But what else can I say about the weather. Today was warmer. It was forty-five. Warm. <SEP> So what's the temperature today over there? It's probably fifty fifty-five maybe. Maybe not that warm. Probably about. It's not that cold really. <SEP> And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill. But they talk about wind chill here all the time. That's a big deal in Texas too. <SEP> They said it could be like six degrees out and negative forty-one wind chill. So that's what we're not used to. That's true. That makes a big difference. <SEP> So I. So did you used to ski when you were out here? What's that? Did you used to ski when you were in Utah? <SEP> I've only skied in Utah once. I only skied once my whole life. <SEP> But do you do a lot of skiing there? Not tons. But I like to when I get a chance. I've only been once so far but had the opportunity a couple times since then. Just saving my money for Christmas things and that. <SEP> So is this your first year in Utah? This is actually my third year. <SEP> And you're going to school there? <SEP> At U of U. Or. At B Y U. <SEP> But I'll be here a long time at this rate. What's your major? It was nursing. But I'm in the process of changing it right now. <SEP> Because it's really really competitive at B Y U. You have to have a three seven to get in. So It's really. <SEP> That's true. I'm going to look into some other fields. I'd like. All the science classes and that I'm just not really enjoying too much. So I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school. So. <SEP> That's a good idea. Did you graduate in a certain field. Or. Education. I got a double major. In. <SEP> Elementary and special ed. That what my sister did. <SEP> You might know her. Here name is Lori Bird. Maybe not. I think she graduated around then too though eighty-seven probably. But she got her doc-. I can't. There are so many girls in all my classes. I can't remember how many people. <SEP> Because they since stopped that program. Where you can get it double pretty easily. Have they? <SEP> It's really.
