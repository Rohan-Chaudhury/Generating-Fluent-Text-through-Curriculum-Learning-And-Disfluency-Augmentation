Do you have a pet? I have two cats. And do and two fish. Two cats. You're lucky. <SEP> Your two fish. And what do you have? My husband. You know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing. <SEP> My husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog. So we have a black Labrador. Beautiful gorgeous black Labrador. But to me he belongs up in the farm. <SEP> Does he sleep in your house? And. Because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind he sleeps in the laundry room. And then he goes out for the day. But this is a beautiful dog. And he is wonderful with our little girls. And he's comes from a purebred line. And there's nothing you could say bad about him except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle. <SEP>. And this is huge. Course when he runs around the yard he just digs. He doesn't know that he's tearing up things. But he does. <SEP> And the worst part that I had with him was when he was about eight months old. And I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one. And I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour. And I came home. And he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall. <SEP> And it was in the floor. And I just about lost it. And I called. And I said come home and get your dog. And so he said puppies just chew when they're nervous and I wish you had told me. And it was about eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum. He kept picking at it. And I didn't kn-. The tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it. So the last thing he did was when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch. And I told my husband. I said it's either me or the dog. And he looked at me. <SEP> He loves this dog. And every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him. And he's a good dog. So it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to. And that's why I laughed when they called with the topic. I thought do I have a pet. But I grew up with cats. And I'm very comfortable. <SEP> I love my cats. I had one cat for eighteen years. I got her when I lived in Hawaii. <SEP> Before I even got married I had my cat. She's old. I had to have her put to sleep last June. Isn't she? <SEP> I started to say. Then you broke your heart. <SEP> It was awful. It was just awful. And she just sat there on my lap. <SEP> She just waited. And. Bless your heart. It was awful. That makes me feel so bad. <SEP> But her hair. But the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband's shoes. And she just liked his shoes. And he'd have these hundred dollar shoes. <SEP> It was just bad. <SEP> And my closet. And it was something. That's awful. I never heard of that before. It was terrible. And once she did it then she wouldn't. If our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husband's shoes. <SEP> She must have known he didn't like her or something. Or the smell or something. I. And I would bar the closet doors and would clean the carpets. <SEP> And. It was just awful. Does your cat sleep in the house? <SEP> That was very funny. They are house cats. I have two cats right now. <SEP> And of course. They sleep with my kids. My fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat. <SEP> But the cat doesn't destruct does it? It doesn't do anything. I'm not going to have a dog. <SEP> We've had two dogs. And they both got ran over. After we had them for several years just nice little outside dogs. But. <SEP> Were just my kids' friends. They would go with me when I would go running. And the last one got hit as she was following one of my sons across the road to the school. <SEP> It was awful. It was just. That is. And it's too heartbreaking. But they do dig up. And they just wreck things. And I'm not a dog person. They do wreck things. <SEP> I'm not either. I'm not either. And it's just been. <SEP> I wouldn't want a Lab. It sounds beautiful. But. He's beautiful. But it's just one of those concessions I just had to make. <SEP> But I kind of ignore him. Today's the first cold we've had in Texas. And it's really cold and drizzly. And it's freezing. And people are doing their fires. And I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there. And he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square. And he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me I won't make any trouble. <SEP> And then my daughters both have hamsters. And I. <SEP> And how old are your girls? They're eleven and eight. And I gave in at Christmas. And they keep their cages real clean. It always smells of cedar. And they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and. <SEP> I think they're cutting us off. That's. <SEP> Somebody's trying to cut in on my line. And I don't want to answer. I'll just wait. <SEP> I've got incoming calls. And I don't know why -body's calling. I hate to cut it off. I think they would cut us off. I understand. <SEP> So we'll just wait. Whoever it is will call back. They'll cut us off pretty soon. <SEP> It's somebody calling for my kids. I know. Actually it's my son. I know it is. <SEP> My older boy. He never likes to come home from school. Anyway that's what we have. And I've tried to start a fish tank. How does. And I keep losing all my fish. In the salt water? <SEP> Salt water or. <SEP> Just regular water.
