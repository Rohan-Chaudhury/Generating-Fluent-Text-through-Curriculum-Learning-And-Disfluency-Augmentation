What do you think about it? How are we doing in recycling? Are we. I think we need to do more. I know I need to do more. They have programs around where you can reach the. They come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up. <SEP> But I have a hard time of separating my trash. And get all the cans from the paper. And I just haven't gotten that dedicated yet. So. I do a lot of work with the boy scouts. And we try to do a lot. <SEP> But there's still a lot more we can do. I don't recycle my newspapers myself. But I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a clothes hamper kind of thing that you lay your string in then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up. <SEP> So I figured I might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper. Sometimes it just sits around for a while. And then we just chuck it. <SEP> I don't get the paper every day. But I get it on. I try to buy the early edition for the coupons the Sunday edition. So. But then I just bundle it up and put it on the front walk every Monday or every other Monday and have them pick that up. <SEP> But that's the extent of what I've done. I'd like to be able to do more. The problem with a lot of it is it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it. And. It's not always convenient to do it. And here in Lubbock everything's so close. I can imagine what it's like up there. <SEP> I'm not exactly sure where the can thing is. But sometimes it's just so. Seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them. I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall. <SEP> And then I put me a little five gallon bucket. And it's just outside the garage door. So every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket. <SEP> Do those can crushers work good? I got one from Payless Cashways. And it's actually metal. It's not plastic. I didn't want to buy a plastic one. <SEP> Because those things would just snap. But Payless Cashways has them. And they're metal. And I don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there. But it was only seven dollars not too bad. <SEP> I'd have to check into something like that because we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here. But occasionally we have some around. But for other kind of cans it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they. I don't. I don't think it would crush steel cans. It's pretty tough. <SEP> So. I don't know. I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that. But I need to look into it more. You could probably just. It. Sometimes even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper. They won't take paper that's shiny. <SEP> They won't take any lint free paper. Or I work at T I. So does my husband. We do a lot of recycling out there. <SEP> Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard. But that's just now come on board. We've been throwing paper out there away for years. And we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out. <SEP> I don't know what. I haven't. I'm sure they're probably doing that here some. I'm sure they are. T I is doing it pretty well nation-wide I'm sure. <SEP> I think it's necessary. I like it. It makes. I think it's good that you see these boxes cereal. They're now starting to make the packages out of recycled paper. And I've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper. And I think they're just fine. I bought a. I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work. It's his birthday. We're pretty good friends. And what it is is a recycled paper bag. <SEP> And it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside. And it's just a paper bag. And it's really cute. <SEP> But I think we're doing better and better all the time. Still don't. <SEP> I think we're becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more. So. There's not going to be any room shortly. The office. I don't know what New York does about theirs. I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere. <SEP> It's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere. But I think we're getting better at it. I think there's quite a bit more we could do. <SEP> Girls put that away. Now. But you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth. I just wish it was a little more convenient to do. <SEP> Seems like you're so busy anyway. And then that's just one more thing to have to worry about. So. It sure is. I think if the cities locally they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier. So. They'll get at it sooner. I guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later. <SEP> Get the kids interested in it too. They have. We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have. And we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans. <SEP> If we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people they'll save them for us there's no problem there. But what do you do with them in the meantime? <SEP> That's right. I don't want a garage full of cans. That's right. Who does. People don't have room for that kind of stuff. <SEP> They're not prepared for it. And in Texas they're just get things like that. They just get bugs in them. So. They do. <SEP> So you don't. The more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get. That's for sure. That's right. So. <SEP> I'm pretty lazy about it right now. Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the. Pick it up. So. Myself. About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans. <SEP>. I need to get better at it. So. If we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way. <SEP> That's right. That's right. If everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then we'll get there. That's true. <SEP> That's right. Thank you for talking to me. <SEP> Thank you for calling. I. No problem. Take care. <SEP>.
