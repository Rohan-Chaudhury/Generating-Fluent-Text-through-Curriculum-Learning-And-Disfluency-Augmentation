You ready? Is that it? That's it. <SEP> I guess we have to talk about magazines. And what. What kind do you subscribe to or do you? I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time. I do. I enjoy PEOPLE. And now I subscribe to LADIES HOME JOURNAL. I take a computer magazine. And also BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS. <SEP> Are you interested in computers? And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside. And the cardboard pages. <SEP> <SEP> That would be one of my peeves. My pet peeves with magazines the woman's magazines especially. It's really geared to. All they have. You have too many recipes first of all. I just don't. That's what I don't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines. Too many recipes too many can this marriage with saved nonsense. I like to read articles about things that matter. Of course PEOPLE magazine is not one of your more intellectual magazines. But it's nice light reading. If I want something intellectual I usually read a book. That's true. I like it when they have short stories. REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it. <SEP> That's true. They did. And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while. So I guess. I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore. <SEP> Is REDBOOK still in existence? I don't know if they're around anymore. I think it is. Surely. It's an institution. Surely it would have to be. But. <SEP> I'll tell you the only reason I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of. Which I think it was either. It was Publisher's Clearinghouse. They told me if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their list. So. Mine too. This was it my last chance. <SEP> My last chance to win ten million dollars. So I figured look. For twelve dollars. I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that to ENTERTAINMENT. <SEP> That's it. And I was real disappointed with it. <SEP> I don't know. It just. Not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into. It's little short articles more than anything else. <SEP> And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE. It doesn't seem to have enough story to it. I don't know. I just think It's light reading. If you've only got a short time to read. <SEP> You don't have to concentrate. That's true. It's entertaining. And that's. I enjoy it. I. That ENTERTAINMENT is very. Isn't it similar to the TV GUIDE? Not really. Not the one I take now. It's a magazine. And it goes into all the movies previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes. <SEP> I see. And I'm a real movie buff. So that's why I thought I might be interested in it. But it just hasn't been what I thought it would be. <SEP> And the reason I get the HOME JOURNAL and the computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me. Otherwise if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf I'll pick it up then. Rather than having them delivered and think I really need to read this. <SEP> I'll tell you since I've been getting the JOURNAL maybe I'll read two maybe three. If I read three articles in one of the JOURNALs I figure I did really well. <SEP> Because there's just nothing in there that interests me. I'm not into recipes. And. I do like recipes and crafts. And I'm not into crafts. So that eliminates three quarters of the magazine. <SEP> That's true. I just got the new issue. They have Bette Midler on the cover. So that should be one article that I'll read anyway. Do you.
