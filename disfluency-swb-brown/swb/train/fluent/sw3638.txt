The Cowboys are my favorite team. That's pretty easy to say nowadays. Lot easier than it was a couple years ago. But they had a big win today. Did you get to watch it? <SEP> I didn't. I have been at my computer all day. So. Are you a Cowboy fan? I used to be a real big Cowboy fan. And I'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan. <SEP> Being an Okie I just really don't care much. It's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan though. <SEP> They've always been my favorite. And I guess I still have a soft spot. <SEP> I just hate that that's the coach that's leading them. <SEP> So have they. They're in the playoffs? They made it to the playoffs finally. Just two years ago they were one and fifteen. They won like just one game. And so pretty fast turnaround. But this year they made it to playoffs. And today was the first game. And they beat the Chicago Bears. So everybody's really going crazy down here. I'll bet they are. They're going crazy. So they turned it around. But they have a lot of young exciting players now. Everybody was real upset when they fired Tom Landry. But now it's like they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that. <SEP> Football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world. Hit a bad season. And it's the coach's fault. Let's dump him. <SEP> First good season the coach can do no wrong. But Dallas has always been good ahead heading good players and both running backs and defense. <SEP> They have a young team. It's a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old players every year and same coach same everything. So now it's like a taste of something different. They're all not mister nice guys like they used to be. <SEP> Now it's tough and dirty team. So everybody is really excited. And. Who is the competition going to be? It's supposed to be the Redskins but we beat them already. We beat them this year in Washington. So everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl. But it's just that we have to play every game away. It's going to be tough. But every-. The competition are teams that they've already beat this year. So Atlanta they're in it too. And we beat them. And Detroit we play them next week. But we should beat them. Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them. So everything's looking real good. <SEP> Course I think you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal. <SEP> And it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played. <SEP> The Cowboys are on a roll. They've won six or seven in a row now. So they're supposed to be the hottest team in the league going into the playoffs. So. But since you have an O U drop out as a quarterback. Troy Aikman. He got hurt at O U. So he transferred to U C L A. <SEP> He really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U. <SEP> O U has always been known for their running game. More than. They're playing tonight in fact. <SEP> I'm watching them on T V right now. But they're doing some stomping on Virginia. I tell you. They've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts. They're doing good tonight. <SEP> Are they? I haven't been watching. They're winning. They're winning forty-one to seven. <SEP> Good for us. <SEP>. But. And that's right. Aikman did go to O U. I forgot about that. <SEP> They h-. Then he went out to southern Cal. Is that where he went? U C L A. <SEP> But the Cowboys did good today. I was proud. I thought they would get beat today because they're so young. Playoffs.
