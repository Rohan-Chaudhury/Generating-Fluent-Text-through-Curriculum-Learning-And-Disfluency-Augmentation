I guess I've always been kind of interested in space and stuff. I've read a lot of the astronomy books and stuff like that. <SEP>. <SEP> Have you been following the progress of the space health code? To a degree. I haven't kept up as much as I would like. I've just been so busy <SEP> I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then. So. I think it's pretty exciting that they can. It would be interesting to see if they can find other planets that will be more habitable to humans. And. I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if it is at all possible. I wouldn't even mind being a pilot on one. <SEP> Or right now. But I'm probably getting a little too old for that. I know if they make the advances that they have been making that maybe age or even physical abilities may not be a barrier anymore. They just made leaps and jumps. I think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel equipment and stuff that. <SEP> I agree. As a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to visit the space center out there. And one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro. And that vacuum little space program was one of the big backers of that. <SEP> It's amazing. You. It's hard to imagine what life was like without it now. I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher. He's one of the comedians. And he talks a lot on Velcro. <SEP> I've seen him before. What would we do without it? <SEP> We were talking about that just the other day. What did we do without it back then? I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps. <SEP> There's a lot of little things that have come up. I know maybe some of the big things that. Concentrated foods for one maybe. I don't know. That's right. That's right. It's also just I've often pictured in my mind what would you find if you just kept on going? <SEP> That's true. I guess our minds are so. Finite. When we try and picture the universe as an infinite object and it's hard to see. <SEP>. I always thought what do you do hit a brick wall eventually. <SEP> It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely. That is something that would be hard to think about. I agree. Like you say we're used to finite things. And something that is infinite and just incomprehensible. But. <SEP> But. I would like to see them do more in that area to make space travel more something that the ordinary person can enjoy. I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something. And I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some. <SEP> Me too. I wouldn't even mind not so much being first but just get out there and just explore. I think it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't or experience something indifferent. <SEP> I think that's what made us progress to the state we are is our curiosity. Of course. That's true. There must be some better way of doing this. A better place to be or whatever. It's. <SEP> So you are always looking for something better. That's true. I know at work people always complain to me. You are always whining. And it's I'm always looking for something better. <SEP> There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it. <SEP> That's right. That's right. And if you are just content with the way things are then you must lead a pretty dull life. Because if yo-. They are always finding easier ways. And just because they don't talk about it or something like that. <SEP> And they are doing it unconsciously. I guess you don't really think about it too much. I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff. But yo-. It's a subconscious thing. Somewhere they can sit down and write down what things that you've improved upon. You probably wouldn't have a pretty good list. <SEP> But you just don't think about them. And that's true. I think. We've gotten different programs at work to make it visible to management that we are doing things better.
