With credit cards me I try to get maybe just one or two. I don't like having credit cards for every store. I just don't like them. What are you afraid of with them? What am I afraid of? <SEP> I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much. I just don't think that I need them. I. They are tempting at times. But sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me. So. <SEP> That can be very very true. And everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money. So. That's the idea. They figure that if they give you card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it. <SEP> And. That's right. They make money off of it whether you use it or not. <SEP> The other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you would be paying interest. That's right. <SEP> I use mine a great deal for groceries for everything that I can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing. <SEP> That's what I do. That's what I do. Just a second. <SEP> That's all right. Sounds like you have a little one there. I have two little ones. You have. So tha-. <SEP> How old are they? Four and two and half. Those are two very active ages. So. I'm like you. I only use my credit card for when I. I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check. But I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month. <SEP> Do you ever use the A T M machines? I never do. My husband does at work just to get cash out. But I take the checkbook. So if I need cash I just tell him. And he gets it out. And I don't even think I know my number. <SEP> I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash. That's right. He couldn't do without it since he can just do it right there at work for nothing. <SEP> That helps. <SEP> The other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash. And when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on. You're right. And that's kind of silly. <SEP>. Because they figure that that's correct. You're defeating the purpose. <SEP> The idea is to use their money. <SEP> And during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month. I get at least one or two a week. People sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it. <SEP>. Because I. <SEP> I think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted. It's like I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line. <SEP> I-. You've already been preapproved. Preapproved. That's their favorite word. Everybody in the country is preapproved I think. <SEP> I think so you're right. It's interesting that people have generally the same view. Of credit cards no matter where you go. <SEP>. <SEP> And then some people they get so wrapped up in them that one day they find I didn't realize I'd spent this much money. That much stuff. <SEP> And then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it. And some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own. <SEP> And that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem. It does because you're just costing yourself more money because if you can't make the monthly minimum payment you're paying interest again. That's right. So. <SEP> That's right. So. It's been enjoyable talking with you. It's enjoyable seeing that somebody feels the same way. So. <SEP> Take good care. Take care of your little ones. You too. Good luck. <SEP>
