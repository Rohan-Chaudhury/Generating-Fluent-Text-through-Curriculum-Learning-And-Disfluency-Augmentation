Donna you said you have three children. What kinds of activities do you spend with them? Is it? We have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old. And my husband he coaches basketball with Brian. <SEP> So he spends time doing that with him planning and practicing outside. He's a real sports kind of person. So he plays tennis with the kids. We all kind of play tennis as a family. Except the baby plays in the playground. <SEP> We take turns with her. Let's see. We have a computer. And we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer. Let's what else we do. Plus we watch a little T V together. We really don't watch as much T V as a lot of people. We don't have H B O. We do get the Disney channel for the kids. <SEP> My kids have a Nintendo which they play. And my husband sometimes joins them with that. My little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things. And I'll take some time and do that with her. And of course we always read a bedtime story at night. And even the older kids sometimes sit down and will join in and listen to a story. I'm basically the story person because my husband doesn't have. <SEP> He gets home from work late or whatever. And once in a while he'll read the story to little one. But that's basically my job. So do you find it difficult to find time. Or is it pretty natural? <SEP> It is. It is hard because at the end of your day you want time for yourself. <SEP> And it. And that's kind of cutting into your time. And with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed at ten which really is late. <SEP> But on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine. They go upstairs at nine. And now this weekend we'll have a baby-sitter come. And my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home probably not too late. Maybe Brian will still be up and spend some time with him. But it's really hard. You have to be a very unselfish person to spend a lot of time with your kids I think. Do you work during the day? <SEP> I don't work. Last year I had a little part time job in a private high school tutoring high school students with learning disabilities. That was two days a week. And even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot. I don't know how. I admire people that can do it all. <SEP> But with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way I want it kept it is hard. I can imagine. <SEP>. Even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything. <SEP> And that's another thing. I'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping usually on the weekend. And that's kind of a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son. And they'll be my helper. And then they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out. So I try to do things like that. But it's. <SEP> And then of course they have a pretty busy social calendar too. You fit it in with all that. What do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general in America? <SEP> I think a lot of people set their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies and kind of leave them to their own means. <SEP> I think it's very very easy to fall into that trap. And I'm not totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape. <SEP> But I think different parts of the country. I think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids. People are real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and. That's good. <SEP> But. Families are facing a challenge. I know that with. <SEP> What. I'm a newlywed. And we're thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years. And. <SEP> And it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to cut back to one. But if you have the type of job. I have a friend that's a nurse. And she can pick her hours. And. <SEP> That's a great career. I wish I would have gone into nursing. Because she has such a flexible schedule. But it's very hard to spend time with the children and your husband and do everything at once. <SEP> But I do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because. I think it's a big responsibility. You just don't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single. <SEP> When you have children you have to say this is different. And you do have to give things up. I personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child at least for the first two years of their lives. If you can possibly swing it. <SEP> Because they.
