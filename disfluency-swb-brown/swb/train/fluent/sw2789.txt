Are you on any kind of regular exercise plan? I do aerobics step classes and toning classes. Step classes? <SEP> What's that? It's a new form I think. It's like low impact aerobics. But it. Instead of hopping and jumping you just step. And. <SEP> You have a step. And you literally step up on the step and move your arms. It's new. <SEP> It's fun. I probably couldn't do that because of my knee. Bad knee. <SEP> And I do toning a lot and some. Every once in a while I play tennis. I'm not too great at it. But I try to play. I've kind of gotten out of the habit myself. It's. I guess what I do now is I play softball right now. <SEP> That's about. Right now I'm on two teams. So it's four nights a week. So I enjoy it. But as far as. <SEP> Instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there I went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it. <SEP> Ye-. I need to make myself do that. I slacked off a little because of. I'm about to graduate from college. And so this past couple months have been really hectic. So I haven't really gone. And I've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out. But. What school you going to? <SEP> I'm at East Carolina. But. I. My step classes and toning is about the only thing. What's toning? Is that lifting weights? <SEP> It's isolated movements for certain muscles groups. You can do with. Isometrics stuff like that. <SEP> You can do it with weights if you wanted to. But you leave out of there. Usually the next morning if you haven't done it in a while you wake up the next morning. You're. What did I do to myself. And your whole body aches. I know I'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape. I feel like I'm out of shape. But I feel guilty for not going because I'm so used to going for three or four years now. <SEP> I stayed in pretty good shape during school. But. I played baseball all the way through. <SEP> And working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape. <SEP> But ever since I got out of school just jumped right into the job. And I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule. <SEP> Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling. <SEP> Some. I walk a lot because being in school we. I don't know if your campus was anything like ours. But our parking lot's in one end of the campus. And the buildings are all at the other end. You ut-. I didn't have much of a problem. I guess I went to a small Baptist school. And we had about maybe thirteen hundred people. <SEP> That's if. So it's pretty small. But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant. <SEP> It's. I live on the second story apartments. So I walk up and down stairs all day long. <SEP> We've got a one story house now. That's enough. I guess I push the lawn mower around. That's fairly regular. <SEP> That's one of the exercise now. I would like to start running. I've never been much of a runner. But I want to start. I want to run. But I don't know if I'll be able to do it. What. Just because you don't like to or because you won't be able to. <SEP> I'm afraid I won't be able to. If you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running. I wish I'd. <SEP> I hope not. We ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough. I don't even own a bike. I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve. I don't know. I'd be afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike. You can't forget how to ride a bike. <SEP> I guess that's about the only form. I'm trying to think of other things that I do that will be considered exercise. There are things I should do. I know it ju-. When I was going to. I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred. When we were at this junior college our coach. We. One semester the whole team was required to take aerobics. And the next semester they were required to do weight lifting. <SEP> So they. It was a regular. We had it for course credit. But still it was pretty high impact stuff. <SEP> Those aerobic classes are tough the high impact. Definitely are tough classes. And she'd. Most of the guys were all in one class. So she'd kind of lay it on occasionally. <SEP> First at eight we had. Eight o'clock in the morning was our class. Wake up. <SEP> Now they have those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for toning instead of using a weight. You have bands. I don't know if you've seen them. <SEP> They're weird. I think my wife has some. They're just made of different kinds of rubber. <SEP> And they get. Or sand even some of them. They're elastic. So I guess it wouldn't be sand. And there's some that the different colors denotes how much the tension they are and how easy they are to move. <SEP> I know there's purple gray and green. And some of them are real short. And they're the ones that are the tough ones to use. But those classes I enjoy. I think with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun. If you don't have one that's fun and not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out what they should get out of the class. <SEP> If the. Are you going to get into instructing? What are you studying? I'm an interior design major. Not in the aerobic instructor type field. <SEP> I could never do that. <SEP> I'd rather just be the student. And Occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights just. Some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting. They really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups with those things. <SEP> But they are. I don't know. To me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back. <SEP> I just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized machines. And you set a speed on it and the weight. And it makes you do it. And it tells you. If you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you. And stuff like a turtle goes faster. And it tells it. And the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you. A little negative reinforcement there while you're going. <SEP> So do stuff like that. But just I've never used those machines. I just use the regular machines and the free weights like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights. Just to do some bicep tricep exercises. Sit-ups of course. That's where I'm really starting to get noticeable. <SEP> I'm just getting real soft in the middle. I think that's number one problem with everyone. I haven't really started to put on a lot of weight. I guess I probably put on about nine or ten pounds since I stopped playing which was about four years ago. <SEP> But I just notice myself just real soft. And I'm sure I don't have near the endurance that I did. But I keep saying I intend to get back into it. <SEP>. I just need to put the old nose to the grindstone. I guess at that point it would turn into a task. I don't consider it fun doing that. But. <SEP> I plan on getting back once I graduate next weekend. Next weekend? Next weekend. <SEP> One week. Then I plan to get right back into it. It does a lot for you I think. Makes you feel a lot better. There's no question the end result is great. And I enjoyed. We. When I was playing ball we could run all day and not be tired. <SEP> And you feel so much better about yourself. <SEP> Just that you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner. I still don't. But. That's a problem. <SEP> Good luck on your graduation and your. Thank you. It was nice talking to you. You too. <SEP>.
