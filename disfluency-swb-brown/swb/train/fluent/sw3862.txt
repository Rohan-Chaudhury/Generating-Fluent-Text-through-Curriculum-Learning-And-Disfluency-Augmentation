. My name is Dolphene. I live in Texas. <SEP> My name is Pat Johnson. And I live in Texas too. I work for T I. Do you also? <SEP> I live in Dallas. I work for the Dallas school system. You ready to begin? We might as well. <SEP> I understand we are doing care of the elderly? And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? I don't think that any of my relatives would really like to go there. I believe if I am in a position when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also or have someone go into their home and look after them. <SEP> That way. I would find it very difficult to place my father or my step-mother in a place like that. Particularly since I know how they feel about it. <SEP> It's more how they feel about it. And it is like they feel like somebody had thrown them away? <SEP> I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to look for if you are faced with placing someone. In a place like that aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such. <SEP> But attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference. And I have a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who could care for her. <SEP> And I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about her situation. And another thing to think about on the positive side of the nursing homes here. I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home. And I got to see a lot of the things that they did. <SEP> They had a lot of crafts. And they had a lot of games. And they get together and just do they do all sorts of things. And then there. Some of the people that are in there are very nice and friendly to everybody. <SEP> And then there are others that are. It is just a job. And they just want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home. <SEP> The attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important. <SEP> I think it would matter too kinds of disabilities that the nursing home accepts. Because there are some who poor things don't have any real grasp on reality any longer. <SEP> And they may be ambulatory. But they tend to behave like small children. And that would be very difficult for an adult who wasn't in that situation to have to deal with on a daily basis. <SEP> It is like wel- the one that I worked in you would see some of them just in wheelchairs all day. They would just roll themselves around all over the place. And they would enjoy themselves with activities. And then you would see some of the others that were distant from the other group. And they just didn't participate together with the others because they had some slight mental disabilities and things like that. <SEP>. What do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that. <SEP> Alzheimer. And they weren't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities. And that can.
