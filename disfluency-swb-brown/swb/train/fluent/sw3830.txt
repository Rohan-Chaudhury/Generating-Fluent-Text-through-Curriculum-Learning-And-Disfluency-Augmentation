. How you doing? <SEP> Fine. I'm Lee with. I'm over here in Plano Texas. Let me ask you something can I run a minute and shut my radio off? <SEP>. Where are you calling from. Or where are you at? <SEP> Arlington. Arlington Texas. Arlington. <SEP> There's a lot of stuff going on in Arlington these days. Not all good stuff. Are you involved in any of that? <SEP>. I'm not personally. What benefits do. Do you work? <SEP> I'm going to school right now. You are? I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think. <SEP> I've got a lot of. Because I work for myself. <SEP> And so there's a lot that I guess I do miss a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation. I miss insurance and the steady paychecks that come. <SEP>. But. <SEP> I've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact. I'm selling in out now to go to school full time. And I enjoyed the freedom of having that. Is that right? Go to work when I wanted to or not. <SEP> But the benefits weren't there. I own part of a roofing company. <SEP> Do you? In the Dallas Fort Worth area. And unfortunately we were part of a bigger company. <SEP> And we had all the benefits there. And I do miss that. But on the other hand I enjoy having the time that I have with my family and being able to work when I want. <SEP>. And. <SEP> I think today the thing that I would appreciate the most. Because my husband gets his medical through his company. But we have to pay for mine. <SEP> And I'm the only one that's being insured. And we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has. Is that right? So it's kind of. <SEP> And I would. I really. And the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits you need to have. It's. <SEP> It. I'll tell you what. That is the single most benefit that I enjoyed and I do miss. <SEP> Because I looked into picking up some medical insurance just for my family just. And it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it. It's out of sight. <SEP> It's out of sight. And. Even at a group rate I couldn't believe how much is our. <SEP> Even at a group rate. It's unbelievable. And the amount that you have to pay for kids. And if you want to add dental to it that eats even more. It goes up. <SEP> I guess the other benefits that I miss is some of the bonuses and stuff that goes on with just being involved with a big company. And course these days you can't count on that because. <SEP> I feel bad for the people that are involved in that G M deal there in Arlington. And I'm sure it will be quite a few people are affected by that. <SEP> It's going to hurt the city. Although I will personally tell you I used to work at a bank. And I would see the G M people come in when they would shut down to retool. They were paid that whole time. And I don't know if you're aware of this r-. <SEP> They come in there. Just they go off fishing and stuff and come in every Friday and go to the safety deposit box. And I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week. And they had all these gr-. Is that right? I really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked. The union. <SEP> And right now anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck. I just read this in the paper the other day. Is that right? Plus probably an additional six months through the worker's stuff that they have through the company. So I'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt. <SEP> But I don't feel as sorry for them. If my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check. Really the. <SEP> And that would be it. Really the ones it's going to hurt is actually the businesses around in that area. <SEP> That's already hurting. That's the ones that that's going to hurt because they depend on that. <SEP> But I think there's a case where benefits have gotten. They voted them in. And they got so good like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things. <SEP> And it made the prices of cars go up. And the. <SEP> I believe in unions. But they went too far. I'll tell you I've had my fill of unions. I can't make eighteen dollars an hour. I. <SEP> I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour.
