I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job. At least their plans are good. However I was. Maybe you saw in the paper this morning that they've had some problems with the recycling on plastic. <SEP> With the plastic. I thought that was most interesting. I thought it was sad that it started out as a good program. But then people started dumping trash. And the wrong objects in there. <SEP> And that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump. <SEP> That's right. And it's too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing. <SEP> I guess that's going to happen. <SEP> A really good effort. That's right. But. I was thinking about the other day many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri I went. This was probably. It have been nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight. I went to a meeting. And one of the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling. And she was from Saint Louis. <SEP> And she had this fantastic family effort in recycling. And she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum. And I thought one person is doing that. But my thought was it's a shame. It's wonderful that she's doing it and it. But wouldn't it be much nicer if we all did it. Because her effort would have really really been a good example for all of us. And we were just sort of talking about it at the time. And here we are. Now we're doing it on a city wide basis in communities. <SEP> Doing it. So it's wonderful that we've come that far I think. But. What did she do with. If she. Was she a group that was doing it. <SEP> Or was she doing it on her own. And what did she do with the. I think she was. I was trying to remember. It seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in Saint Louis. There were places where she could actually take her things herself. <SEP> And so it wasn't something that was being picked up. And I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would. But I remember her saying I have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing. And I thought that is wonderful that somebody does that. You have to really want to do it though. <SEP> This is. Even what you recycle. Because we do the plastics and the aluminum and the glass and the paper. <SEP> And of course then you try to buy right too. But a lot of our neighbors say you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that and you have to. Sure you do. <SEP> We had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans. Isn't that amazing? <SEP> And I thought what are you complaining about when you're only going to get picked up once a month or once a week. <SEP> And. People I don't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort. Rather than work with it. <SEP> I don't know. It's. I know what you're saying. Kind of people like that. And it is. It's for everybody's benefit. <SEP> It's not. So maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime. But you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren. And what kind of quality of life are you leaving them? It's on down the line. <SEP> And I have a real concern about that. <SEP> I agree. When. We've never had much trash. Because while. I was raised in a big family. And Gene's family wasn't big. <SEP> But they weren't rich. And they had to recycle. <SEP> And the fu-. They didn't. They just used things. They didn't throw things away before they were used up. <SEP> And. I know. I guess I got a good example from my mother. Because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things. And she is to this day. And she'll even. If she. For instance she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for when she made cookies. It would go on that. Or if she needed sandwich paper or something she'd use that. <SEP>. She recycles everything. And I have done the same thing. I recycle zip lock bags and things like that. <SEP> My kids get the biggest kick out of that. Although they do the same thing. I think they give me a hard time. But I think they know that it's the right way. <SEP> They've picked up the hab-. They do. And when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things then they say mom used to do this and dad used to do that. <SEP> And they appreciate how much it costs to do that. <SEP> That's right. And pretty soon they're figuring out that's not such a bad way. To go. But. That's true. <SEP> I don't know. I wonder how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to make this whole thing work. The extra washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually making sure that you take stuff over to. Some people now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside. And I think you just do your part. People are not. You can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always work out. <SEP> This is what concerns me. You. Over in Europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here. That's right. You've got to be in a country. Even in Mexico you don't see things thrown away like we do here. <SEP>. <SEP> What we throw away is a king's ransom to most people. <SEP> And I. And even to people in our country who scavenge for food. And I think you have to get into a period of need bef-. <SEP> You can't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful. <SEP>. <SEP> This is why I thought Jimmy Carter was never very pos-. People didn't like him. <SEP> Because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that. <SEP> Do those little things. And nobody wanted to hear it. That make a lot of difference. <SEP> I. And I think you're right though. It's. I think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes. <SEP> Or you have to grow up with it being important in your life before the message really takes hold sometimes. And I don't know. It's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am even myself than I used to be a few years ago. <SEP> I'd go to the U T D cafeteria for lunch sometimes. And they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't need to use styrofoam plates. <SEP>. And I think to myself that's crazy. I wonder if maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention. <SEP> And I'm seeing more and more of that. And I think it's just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of styrofoam boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff. I think is a good example that even industry is willing to do it. <SEP> I think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled. <SEP> I think that's kind of what it's coming to I'm sure. That's right. And do we have to wait until all the landfills are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage. <SEP> That's right. <SEP> And I don't. With the mind set of the American public I think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash. That isn't harmful. That wouldn't surprise me. <SEP> Or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean. I know it. <SEP> That's the way we solve problems. And unfortunately. And it's sad.
