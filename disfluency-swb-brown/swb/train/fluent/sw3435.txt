Push my number. Are you a golfer. Or are you a spectator? I'm a. I play golf. But I don't actually play golf. <SEP> I'm the same way. I go out there and hit the ball. Hack it all over the place? <SEP> It's sickening isn't it? In the Carolinas it's just we've got a bunch of golf courses around here. We've got tons up here. But I don't know. How do you feel about your game? I guess that's a good question? <SEP> I'm not a serious golfer at all. A friend of mine goes golfing a lot. And he drags me out every now and then. And I don't really even have a game. I usually. When I go out and play golf it's usually at one of these par threes that you. But I like watching it on T V. I like that too. <SEP> If I can hit a great deal my friends. I don't know. I try to play. But a couple years ago I played two three times a week and got lousy. I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy. And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come. And then I got worse again. So. To get me they say I hit worm burners because I can't hit it up in the air. <SEP> I'm pretty bad. But I get great distance hitting it across the ground. And if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm. But I'm getting better. I've got where now I can hit it in the air some of the time. That's pretty good. So I'm kind of a novice at it. I'm that and worse. I play. Next year I. Actually I take it kind of seriously. But I've been doing so bad. Next year I'm starting over from scratch. I'm going to go take lessons and everything. I'm going to do it right and see if I can actually play this game or not. <SEP> I guess that's what I need to do is get some kind of lessons or something. Because my tee off is not bad. I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that. It's just that initial tee. What do you do when you're putting? That's a good thing. That's something I could learn actually. That's when I do my worst. I finally get to the green. And I think I'm doing all fine. And then. Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really. Checking the ground and so forth. <SEP> See how it's going to break or whatever. Can you really see it though? What about the speed? <SEP> If you get down on the ground you really can. But can you tell how fast you're going to hit it? You know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it. But you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's. Because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction. But you can feel that? <SEP> I don't know. I can get it within four or five feet or something. But I don't have enough field. Now I'm T V watching. They make you die at the hole every time. <SEP> It just dies and rolls in. I don't know. But I. It's hard for me. <SEP> The. It's like I said. Once I get up on the green I'm fine. But that tee shot it. When teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground. So it takes me awhile to get to the hole. But. Once you're there you're all set though. I'm all set. We should play team golf then. <SEP> I'll get us there. And you put it in. That sounds good to me. I s-. The T V golfers they do that. It takes them two to get there and two to get it in. So it's fifty percent. And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in. <SEP> It usually takes me about probably two or three to get it there. And then that's according to the hole. And it ju-. Maybe one or two putts. It's according to where I'm at on the green. That's good. <SEP> But the friends I play with they play all the time. And they're really good. Joe Pros? They're not Joe Pros. But they golf in the high sixties low seventies. So I guess they're pretty good. That's pretty good. For eighteen? <SEP> For eighteen. That's pretty good. I'm talking to the wrong guy. Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen. <SEP> That's not my golf. That's my friends. Mine. I'm usually in the eighties or nineties. So I'm not good. When I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good. I'm usually around a hundred. That's my thing. Around a hundred. I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole. But it ain't going to happen. Teeing off I either slice it. Or I hook it ever single time. And I alternate. It's a good thing with me I slice it every single time. That's good. I aim.
