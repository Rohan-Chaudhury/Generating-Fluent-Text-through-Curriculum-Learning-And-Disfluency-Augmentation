What do you think about the school system? I think they're having a lot of trouble right now. I know my son goes to a private school. But I think big city public schools by definition are having a tough time right now probably from budget cuts and everything else going on. Why did you choose a private school? <SEP> I had one that needed to be able to be moved along at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school. So he has been going to private since kindergarten. Public school. Has he? <SEP> Then how does he like it? He's loved it. He is a senior in high school this year. So he's. So he's been there all the time. <SEP> He's done it the whole twelve and so many years. And it's been really good for him. How big of a school is it? <SEP> Overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper four grades about four hundred and something. So it's maybe a hundred per grade. A hundred per grade that's a good size. It really is. Kind of gives them the. I get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids. But. <SEP> We were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture. And he's done really well. So they don't. That's good. <SEP> And he was just ahead at an early age. And I didn't feel like what was available particularly in the first three grades. And even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program. <SEP> And I just didn't think that was going get it. I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead every day. But yet still be with his peers age wise. Still enjoy the. <SEP> One thing I think I've noticed is my oldest is in kindergarten. So I'm in a little different ballgame. You're just getting started. <SEP> I'm just starting her. But seems to me that kids these days can really get away with murder. And the teachers aren't respected as much. And they have to be so careful of the things they do and say. <SEP> I know. That's a big problem. And makes me a little nervous that students don't seem to show that respect. And. <SEP> We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school. <SEP> Wouldn't have thought of it. And they'll stand there now with them toe to toe. You wouldn't. And. And the things they can say and do to a teacher. I think that's wrong. I think we need to get back to show some respect. And course I guess the teacher used to warrant that. But. <SEP> But a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in responsible positions I don't think have had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases. For other people. <SEP> And. And so then you wind up with little brats on your hands. How do you think that that's happened? You think our society's just stopped talking out. Or this generation's just kind of changed a little bit. <SEP> I guess I. The world changes. So obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be. <SEP> They're exposed to a whole lot more things. They have a whole lot more variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age. So life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time. But I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to teach basic values and basic respectful -ness of authority. And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore. That just isn't coming through is it. <SEP> I remember it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's. We used to have to wear dresses. <SEP> Had to wear dresses didn't you? And then you had to go to dresses. They had to be a pantsuit. And it was polyester. And it had to be matching. And. <SEP> And when it was skirts it was get down on the floor. And we hold the ruler up here. And it's no more than so many inches above the knee. <SEP> Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time. So it's really changed. It's really kind of gone the rounds. So I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree. They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit. So I. <SEP> I think that probably does have something to do with it. And it's also. This school your son goes to do they require to wear a uniform. Or. They do not do uniforms although one where he was between second and eighth grade did. <SEP> There are quite a few of your s-.
