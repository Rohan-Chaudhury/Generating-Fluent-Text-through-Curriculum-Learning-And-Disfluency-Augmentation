Tell me what you like to do. I collect antique tools for one thing I'm sort of in an antique business. But it's a little sideline part time thing. <SEP> And I'm building a log house at a farm that I have in East Texas which is a hundred miles from here. <SEP> It's really neat. And course I've been working on it for five years. But. But how wonderful. Are you close to getting it done? <SEP> It's getting real close to. Of course there's still a lot of work to be done. And then when you get the shell finished you still have a lot of stuff to do inside. But. Are you going to move your whole family over there then? <SEP> Actually I'm not even sure. I may. I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas. Kind of your getaway place. Escape. But it's beautiful. It's Eastern Hardwood forest. There are a lot of pine trees. But it's mostly oaks. And. How beautiful. And it's pretty flat there? <SEP> It's kind of hilly. But it's low hills. It's not. I've only been to Texas once. I have two sisters in Texas now one in Austin one in Dallas. And the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this. And I thought Austin was beautiful. <SEP> You. I liked the hills and the trees. In Aus-. <SEP> It's really different because that's the chalk hills down there limestone hills. And you've always lived in Texas have you? <SEP> Except for time in service. Born and raised Texan. I had never been there. That's pretty neat. My sisters both seem to like it pretty well. My brother-in-law works for the University in Dallas. <SEP> At which one? He's admissions director. University of Texas in Dallas. <SEP> It's just north of me here. He's got a job there. And this is his first year. So it's been a real interesting thing for them. <SEP> That's great. But they seem to like it okay. I think they're too far away from me. But maybe some day they can get closer. We'll see. <SEP> Pretty good trip. So what kind of hobbies are you in? I'm mother of four. So basically I'm just real busy with my kids right now in sports. And we have a little Halloween talent show tonight. And I substitute at the schools part-time. <SEP> That's great. I am a travel agent at heart. And my hobby is just. I love traveling and being involved of that and finding out more. But it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband. So I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school. So I've been librarian all this week which has been real interesting. And I'm enjoying it. I'm around my kids. And. <SEP> That's pretty easy substituting isn't it? It's great. It's great. And what else do I do. I do lots of cross stitching when I have time. <SEP> And I enter things in our little state fair. And that's pretty fun. That's great. But actually my hobbies mostly is my sports. Tennis. I play tennis. <SEP> I love tennis too. Do you? And I ski. Do you ski? We snow ski. We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly in Oregon. <SEP> That's great. Have you ever been there? Wonderful place. <SEP> I've skied in Colorado. And we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper. Where in Colorado? <SEP> I've been to Telluride which is on the west side and Copper. Copper is kind of my favorite up there. Breckenridge and Keystone. <SEP> I guess those are the only places I've skied up there. I would love. I can hardly wait to get up there. <SEP> Me too. Are you guys getting snow? We. It is snowing right now. We're to get one to three inches tonight. <SEP>. I heard Aspen got three feet. We are on the dry side of the mountains. Seattle is only about two and a half hours. So of course I'm a real Seahawks fan. <SEP> And going over that pass is just a real nightmare. I can imagine. And we're on the colder side. They're on the rainy side. We're on the snowy side. And we ski. My children all ski. <SEP> And we have been to Whistler in Canada which is just a marvelous place. Whistler and Black Home is in Canada. And then we've gone to Sun Valley several times. That's just a great place. But not in Colorado. Since I went to school. What about Utah? Haven't been there. I keep hearing these marvelous things about Deer Valley and. <SEP> Haven't either. City. Always want to go to Canada to Banff or somewhere like that. <SEP> And your kids all ski? Not all of them. <SEP> My kids are all grown. But my youngest son is a skier. That's great. My boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death. <SEP> When they're skiing they're fearless. And they go off.
