Do you have any children? I have two boys twelve and sixteen. Twelve and sixteen. <SEP> How about you? I have three. And they're five and three and nineteen months. So we kind of got different ball game. But. <SEP> What. Do you feel like you have any time to spend with them? <SEP> They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents. That's true. <SEP> You actually of course spend less time with them when they get older. But it's of course still really important. I have a kind of a fortunate situation right now with my sixteen year old. I work two nights a week at a. I'm a librarian. <SEP> And I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library. They keep it open for kids to do their work. And then the school district hires an aide to work for me. <SEP> My son is my aide. That's nice. So two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together. You're stuck together. <SEP> And there's usually not very much business. Some nights it's just real real quiet. So. I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part. <SEP> So I have sort of a captive audience. So I really do spend probably more time with him than most. But of course I'm away from my other son those hours too. But his dad's at home pretty much that time. And so that kind of gives him time with his dad then. <SEP> That's true. Gives him a little bit of that individual time. <SEP> But it is hard once they get that age. Their friends are the most important thing there is. And they want to be able to spend. That's right. I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year. And every day that she's not at school she thinks we need to have someone over and play. <SEP>. And that kind of. <SEP> It's kind of hard. It's hard. I think I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should. I'm more worried about. I didn't this done. I didn't get. The kitchen needs to be cleaned. <SEP> This needs to be done. And I need to remind myself to slow down. And it'll still be there tomorrow. <SEP> That's true. But that's kind of hard to do. <SEP> It is hard to do. You don't see yourself getting. If you're kind of a person that likes things organized or neat. <SEP> Or. Then I think it is hard. It's. I think one of the nice things about holidays is that it does give you the opportunity to spend more time with family. Slow down a little bit. <SEP> We often go to Illinois for Christmas. And we're not this year. And it's just really nice because we can do the things you want to do. You can do more than when you travel. <SEP> That's right. This is the first year we're staying home too. And I think it's going to be real quiet. But that's an opportunity to get out the games. And. <SEP> We usually do that. My kids even have already gotten out. My twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer. Of course. <SEP> But every now and then he's got a lot of those hard kind. And he wants to be an engineer. So he still likes all that kind of building stuff. And we have the train. And we haven't had that Lego train together for years. So he sat down. And I told him I really wanted him to build the train. And we would put it under the tree and that I would keep it together. I wouldn't take it apart. Wouldn't take it apart after that. <SEP> And every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree. That'd be kind of fun. So he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on Friday. And then his sixteen year old brother started helping too. <SEP> These are kind of things during the normal rat race. Those kinds of things never happen. <SEP> But. In fact I think if people would learn to turn off the T V -s. And. I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family. <SEP> Which is. Usually people are not sitting in front of that. <SEP> And there's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it they're totally turned off to everything else. The rest of. And you can't communicate while you're doing that? That's right. Whereas I'm the type of person I could not sit. I shouldn't say I could not. But be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something. <SEP> Me too. I don't watch very much of it at all to the extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that Because they talk so much. Isn't that the. <SEP> They talk about T V shows. And I. How can you watch that. You're kind of what are you talking about. And. It's the best show on. I don't know. You feel like you're a little bit out of it don't you. <SEP> They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's.
