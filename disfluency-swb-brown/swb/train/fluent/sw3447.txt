The way. I'll go ahead and start. The way I dress for work this year nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie. Or I shouldn't say suit but coat and tie every day. <SEP> A year ago I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group. <SEP> I guess it's a different set of standards. So I dress almost the same every day. Pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat. <SEP>. <SEP> But it was very different before. How do you dress? I'm a drafter. So I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes. And I have sweatshirt on today. <SEP> And that's pretty much the norm for me. If I come in in a dress everybody's shocked. I understand. They ask me what are you doing in a dress. And it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately. <SEP> Ran out of jeans. I understand. That's funny. So does it change? Your dress. <SEP> Or I guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that? So back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like. <SEP> But probably once a month or so there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something. <SEP> Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in. But that's for my husband's job and not mine. I see. I understand. I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him. But. That's interesting. <SEP> Let's see what else about this. It seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two or three levels. That there's the upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't. <SEP> If I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research. <SEP> And I guess you are. That we dress in the jeans. And then there's kind of the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing. <SEP>. But there's not much. <SEP> Middle of the road. It's nice that there's not a requirement for it. <SEP> Sometimes I think there should be. Some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines. I guess you see those once in a while. <SEP> And they have the no shorts deal. And some of these mini skirts are worse than shorts ever thought about being. But I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code. <SEP> That's right. That's right. I guess they're the isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps. I'm not even sure what they are. Supposedly and backless things. Backless. <SEP> But I've seen those too. But. So this wasn't necessarily a big conversation. But I think we did it. <SEP> And your name was Lisa. Lisa. <SEP> Are you the Expressway sites? I am. And I work in the north building. Thank you. <SEP> Thank you.
