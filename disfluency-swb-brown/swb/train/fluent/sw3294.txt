Let's see. So what gets you? As far as I'm. <SEP> The thing I think that annoys me the most is I have young children a baby in the house. And inevitably as soon as they're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something. And I think that that is probably the most aggravating. <SEP> It invades my time. I'm the one that pays for the phone. If I want to buy something I'll take the initiative and go find it. And that just really does aggravate me. What do you think? I. That's exactly the kind of thing I would have said. Although in my case it's my wife and I both work. We come home. And just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings. <SEP> And it's one solicitation call after another. And. Your time is valuable. It's like you say very annoying. And. <SEP> And why do we let this happen. I. That's interesting. I. The market seems to just be growing too. I guess enough people are not speaking out. I'm not speaking out that's for sure. I just get aggravated about it. And. Would you. If you could legislate something what would you legislate? I really don't know. I'm not into heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas. But I don't know. I do particularly find it annoying. I'm really not sure. I haven't given that a lot of thought if it should go to be. <SEP> It seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that. That might. <SEP> And the people making these calls would be obliged to compare their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called. Identify themselves. <SEP> That would be an interesting way. <SEP> And that way those who want it can have it. And those who don't want it don't have to have it. Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself. You're. <SEP> Except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers. Automatically. Is that right? That's interesting. And. And they just get everybody. <SEP>. I do wish that it would stop on my end because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments. And I guess the next one is door-to-door solicitors. <SEP> I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school. I have kids. And that's just kind of part of it. But when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning it makes you not feel particularly safe. <SEP>. And it's annoying as well. <SEP> And these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob. You really don't know. So I find myself being a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than I might normally be. But I do feel like it's an invasion of my space. <SEP> And. What about these telephone callers. Who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire. I've never quite understood the purpose of that. I. <SEP> I think these people were hired from different sources. Just be-. With. And so therefore there's no one answer. But. Basically it's a market survey. Just a survey. <SEP> But they never say who they're really working for or what questions are. There have been a couple of times when whatever the subject was caught my interest and I went along with it. And then there have been several times when I just said I just really don't have the time to deal with it at that moment. <SEP>. But I don't get too many of those. <SEP> I've had just a few. Generally someone's trying to sell me something. Or. <SEP> And sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too. Other times it's wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose. <SEP> For which if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider. <SEP> That's right. But a dollar isn't it. It's. <SEP> And I also sort of worry that sometimes people giveaway personal information. When the call comes and they sort of seductive to. Somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things. And so I start answering. And then you go down a path. And you don't know where it's going to end. <SEP> In fact you don't even know the totality of what you've revealed. We. And This is most likely not going to be used against you. That's true. <SEP> But it could. And that seems to be something that should really be outlawed. Because it's subject to abuse. You just never know I guess. That. I. <SEP> And it. Asking for information is. I can't really see that. I think if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp. And when it arrives at your house I.
