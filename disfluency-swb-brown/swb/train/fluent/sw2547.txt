. What go ahead and tell me about your home. My home at the moment is an apartment. Is that right? <SEP> I work here in Germantown. But I live in Pensacola Florida. That's interesting. I own a home in Pensacola. And let's see. We are to compare homes. Correct? <SEP> My home is typical for the area. I live in a development. It's a relatively. It sounds like I'm bragging. That's okay. But it's upper middle class kind of an environment. <SEP> It's a two story colonial which my wife and I designed. That's neat. It has around thirty-two hundred square feet. Five bedrooms and so forth and so on. That's large. <SEP> And I would imagine in terms of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area. It might be. I would say it's probably midsized for the area. There are some smaller. And there are several larger. But based in terms of in that area of Florida it's what. <SEP> It is probably ten years old. That's not too bad. That's still fairly new. <SEP> And so it's. In terms of cost and size and so forth it. The housing there is extremely affordable compared to other parts of the country. Let's say compared to Maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars. But. You're kidding. <SEP> Do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there. What it's. I really haven't. When we built it ten years ago it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars. <SEP> So I haven't really priced in the market. So I. It sounds like. From the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand. <SEP> Dallas is a very marked up area. Although right now it's a lot lower because of all the layoffs and everything. The economy around here is real poor. <SEP> I thought that was on the upswing again now. Not really. The area itself the Fort Worth Dallas area has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies including Texas Instruments. <SEP> There's been tremendous amounts of layoffs. So really housing is real bad. The economy itself around here is not too terribly bad. But housing is still real bad. <SEP> Pensacola has. It's really is a buyer's market there now. This is. And it isn't because of the. There has been a lot of speculative building. I don't know perhaps not in Dallas. <SEP> But I'm sure people in Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it. Pensacola is a Navy town. And home porting was a possibility a few years ago. <SEP> They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy. A new carrier was coming in and the attendant support vessels. That's no longer the case. So do you think. <SEP> It was overdeveloped then? It is. The number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population. <SEP> And so. Overbuilding has been a real problem there. So you can still get a good house for a very very reasonable price. And good I would. Let's say typical say three bedroom two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land reasonable construction would probably run you right now somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. And probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood. <SEP>. <SEP> What about your home? Right now we're just renting. But it is a home. It's a four bedroom home. It has about eighteen hundred square feet. It's on one floor. <SEP> We have no basement. I don't know. Nor do we. But. <SEP> I wasn't sure. Most of the ones up north and everything do. But anyway it's also pretty typical for the area. Most of this area was developed. This house was built in seventy-four. <SEP> So most of the. It's almost twenty years old. And most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style. We have a friend that lives two blocks over. And his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four. But otherwise the layout is pretty much the same. So I think most of them are. There was. It. Like most areas that are built. There were probably two or three styles you could choose from. <SEP> And that's pretty much all the houses in the area for probably a square mile at least maybe even a little bit more than that. The housing here in Maryland is just atrocious. And in the entire D C area. I'm only about twelve miles or so from the border of Washington D C and Montgomery County. Maryland is probably one of the most expensive places to. Where are you in relation to Sevren? <SEP> Are you close to Sevren? We are west. <SEP> Sevren is east near the eastern shore. I just. If I had. I have a sister that used to live in Sevren. <SEP> And they bought their home around nineteen seventy-five or something like that. And they paid. They had it built from. They designed it and everything. And to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it. And when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand. That's not unusual. So I just wondered if the whole area was like that or. <SEP> That area over there is not as expensive as in the immediate Washington area. And so I was just looking. For example there is a condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live. And I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium. And ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment. <SEP> It was very nicely done. I would have thought. Sounds like a lot of money though. <SEP> I can't envision spending that much money on something along those lines. <SEP> So it's. I guess you pay the piper. Plus the taxes around here are phenomenally high. <SEP> For the. And so you on that. It's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on. What you described as your house and what I would describe as my house. In Pensacola Florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. Maybe a little bit higher than that now. <SEP> But that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it. <SEP> That's. So it's so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county drive twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately the same price maybe a little lower. <SEP> But the taxes would be perhaps maybe one-third of. That much of a difference? <SEP>. So. <SEP> It's really sad. This is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country. Why is that? Do you know? <SEP> They do have such things as extremely good school systems for example. It has one of the best school systems in the country. And because the cost of living around here is so high. <SEP> Public employees make great salaries around here. I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the Montgomery County Public Schools makes. <SEP> And I'm not. This is the figure. He makes eighty thousand dollars a year. That's. <SEP> And I. By administrator I think I mean. They did not define it. But for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone in that range.
