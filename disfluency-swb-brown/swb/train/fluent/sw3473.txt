Go ahead. We're going to compare notes. <SEP> I often desire to exercise often believe I should and rarely do. Don't do it. I tell you I firmly believe in exercising. I think it's a. I do it every day on a regular basis. I. <SEP> What sort of regiment do you have? I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles. But this time of year you can't get much biking in. But every morning I use this President's council of physical fitness. And it's worth doing. And you can do it anywhere. I travel quite a bit in my business. And you can do it wherever you're at. And if you do it. I do it every morning usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get dressed to go to work. <SEP>. And now what I do. I've done this for fifteen years. So you don't start at this kind of regiment. <SEP> I. So what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do. And you'll hurt yourself. Every. It takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time. But I do twenty-five where you have your arms above your head and your body twisters touch left and right toe. And I do ten right and left trunk twisters. <SEP> And I do about sixty leg thrust type things. And I do twenty leg lifters on each side. When you're laying on the floor. <SEP>. <SEP> And then I do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups. And then I do about. You do all of this in fifteen minutes? And then thirty. If you did football like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you. <SEP> Prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing. And that takes maybe about thirteen minutes in the morning. <SEP> What keeps you doing that. I sometimes start much more modest efforts. But I give up. I just find them boring. Hard to find the time for it on a given day. And. Years ago I used to referee football. <SEP> And to stay in condition I did that just as a normal basis. And I tell you just by doing it. Example this summer I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be. So I increased. I do three hundred sit ups a day now but not in the morning. I do a hundred then. And then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed. <SEP> I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles. And you can eat anything you want drink anything you want. But you don't. Within reason you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being. <SEP>. And I just. You're ready to go at a. I think it's really important. <SEP> Whenever I do it I feel. Good that I have done good because it seems right and good because it has good effects. <SEP> But it's this maintaining a regular habit that I just can't seem to do. That's why Chuck I think if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things where you can make excuses like. <SEP> I like biking. And during the summer I'll do at least seventy-five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty. But you can't. <SEP> There's excuses weather. Or you don't have time or something like that. But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour. And you get up a half hour earlier. <SEP>. And once you start getting into that one you just feel good. <SEP> And you look a whole lot better. Does your wife participate in any of this. Or. Unfortunately not. And there's no way I can get her to. <SEP> It's something you either just really want to do it. Or you can't talk anyone into it. If you don't like to exercise it isn't going to happen. I sure wish she would. She's unfortunately overweight. But she's a wonderful woman. And no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it. <SEP>. I keep saying if somebody else would do it with me little bit of peer pressure would help considerably. <SEP> But you seemed to have solved that problem without any external help. No problem at all. And if you get one of these mats. Go to a store they normally have these exercise things these A B C -s of physical fitness on them. <SEP> One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year. And. What's this mat. It's just an exercise mat that rolls up. So you can put it up just in the corner. <SEP> Is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it. You can do that. It's that kind of half inch of foam or something. But it doesn't. <SEP> It's a foam thing. And it's just about six feet long rolls up. <SEP> And I don't take it on trips with me. You could. But I don't mind. If I do sit ups I'll throw a towel down or something. So you don't have the abrasive.
