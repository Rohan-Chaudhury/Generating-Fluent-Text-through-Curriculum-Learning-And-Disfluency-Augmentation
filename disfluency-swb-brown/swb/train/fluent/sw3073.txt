I'm back on. You say you watch evenings mostly? <SEP> I watch evenings because I work all day. I used to watch daytimes. Mainly ALL MY CHILDREN that kind of thing. So. <SEP> And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE. But now it's mainly evenings. Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there? Which ones? <SEP> I tape THIRTY SOMETHING and L A LAW. Those are the two I like the best. Two they're going to change. One they're taking off. <SEP> I know. It's going to be history I know. I don't know what's going to ha-. We like L A LAW. We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING. But that's kind of young for us. My husband and I are grandparents. <SEP> So we don't watch that type of show. But we like L A LAW. We like that. We're just. I'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there. <SEP> I know. I'm amazed. I'm not sure I like the new ones too much. I was surprised at the ending with all the funny things happening and different things. I just wonder if they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long. It looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show. <SEP>. <SEP> I know. Of course I guess that's not bad. Alan Alda did it on MASH. I know. Isn't that funny? It hasn't hurt him at all. Do you mostly like a story type of thing that lasts an hour? <SEP> I don't usually like stuff that continues. That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows because usually I like stuff that just ends sort of that you don't have to have watched. In one hour like QUANTUM LEAP. <SEP> You don't have to. That's one of our favorites. You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow. So I usually don't like that. Which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention. <SEP> That's always a bummer too. <SEP> I know. Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one. We do that sometimes. I guess I'm not into real heavy stuff. L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch. Mostly I'm into it for relaxation. <SEP> So I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS. Or Monday night is real good with me MAJOR DAD and NORTHERN EXPOSURE and. What's that one with Burt Reynolds? That type of show is what we watch. We generally just stay on one channel for all of Monday night just to watch those. Just some of the times they're continued. But mostly they're just little vignettes. A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS. Have you seen that? <SEP> It's really funny. They use animated. It's not a cartoon. But it's dummies and things that are used. And it's really. And robots probably. But there's always a moral to each story. <SEP> And what night is it on? We watched it. The times we've seen it it's been on Friday night. But it's. We've only seen it a couple of times. But it's real. The first one we saw it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five. And I can't remember what day they call it. But the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff. Anyway it goes on. <SEP> And the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all. And then when it comes time for him to throw her over the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her. And she said no. You can't do. He was running in a wheelchair to hide her. And she said `` You can't do that. ''. <SEP> `` This is tradition. This is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the cliff. ''. And he said `` I don't understand. ''. It's real funny that they give the teenagers as the one that questions what's going on. And in the end the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says `` you can't do it'' and then `` we've got to do it. It's tradition''. And the son was `` Why? ''. And so in the end he doesn't throw her over. <SEP> He doesn't. And of course the town thinks he's just terrible because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it. And then we saw one when a teenage boy comes into his manhood. They call it the night of the howling or something like that. <SEP> And they all go out and howl. And the son refused to do it. He did. He thought it was not. <SEP> So he didn't go howl? He wouldn't go howl. So all the people that worked with the father ostracized him. How funny. It is. It's real interesting to watch the show. And the relationship between the family is really now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them. <SEP> So it's. Our oldest grandson is the one that got us to watching it. But it moves real fast. It's real short. And there's always like I say a moral to it. And. <SEP> It's just a half hour. Or is it hour? Half hour. That's all there is to it. And they. <SEP> There's not many half hour shows. It seems like that. They're trying to liken the father in there of the teenage son to JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. The way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth. And I guess maybe there are some parts of that. But I didn't really see that in there. But what I've read about it they talk about that. But anyway we've enjoyed that. And I guess mostly I like the news shows too the news magazines like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that all of those shows if I can do it. <SEP> I watch those if I. But my husband likes to watch old movies especially war movies or sports which I'm not. I like sports. I don't. I do I like ice skating. And I like gymnastics and some track and field. <SEP> But I. And I'll watch snippets of baseball games. And I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing. And no matter what's on I don't ever just sit and watch T V. I'm usually either doing dishes. Or I may be sewing. Or I always have letter writing. <SEP> I know. Or I may be working around in the room somehow. But I don't ever just sit and. That's something that comes from your old age. I don't sit. Idle hands are the devil's workshop. <SEP> I know. Who has time? I don't have time to sit I know. It's. That's why I don't get to watch that much. I watch nine o'clock. <SEP> I do okay because the kids are all in bed. But before that there's not much time. Or at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that. Our. If our grandchildren are with us they have to watch that. We don't watch it unless they're here. <SEP> I like that. I'll watch game show kind of stuff. But they. But. It's. And the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS. <SEP> We've wound up sending in one. That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do. Did you send one? My oldest grandson pulling his tooth. He wouldn't let us pull it. <SEP> How funny. And it got to the point he was eating a pear here. And he bit into it. And it was just hanging by a thread. And I'd tell him it's getting ready to fall out. And he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it. And he wound up pull.
