. Go ahead. What kind of books do you like to read? <SEP> I like all kinds of books. Mostly I like true life documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life. <SEP> And I also like romantic novels. I like READERS DIGEST believe it or not. So do I. <SEP> I usually read that from cover to cover. I like it because there's a little bit of everything in it. <SEP> That kind of a thing. As far as real novels I haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing. I wish I had in some senses. But I don't have time really as much as I would like to get into that kind of thing. How about you? I like like you said real life. I like biographies of people's lives especially athletes. <SEP> For some reason it seems to interest me people that make a big comeback or Orel Hershiser things like that. <SEP> And I like to read books on improve like family marriage things that are written by Christian authors or doctors about family and how to improve your home and all that kind of thing. I like to re-. The magazines I. To rel-. I like to read. I read a lot of bicycling magazines. They're. I mainly look at the pictures and stuff. But they usually have some good articles in it. But I don't know. I haven't really found any romance type stuff I like to read. I'm more nonfiction. <SEP> I haven't found a lot of fiction books that I really like. But not to say I wouldn't. Eventually. What was the last book you read? <SEP> Let me think. It. I tell you I haven't read a book in a long time. And it. I can't even really remember. I think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those. Honestly. I don't do as much reading like I say as I would like to. <SEP> Working a lot of hours at work. And. And then of course we have a home. I know. <SEP> So it's. A lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or that type of thing. I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is about eleven more books than I would have read last year. But so far I've only read two books. And so I'm not doing very well. But. <SEP> But I do crafts too. So it's hard. If I have a minute that's what I do. I find it's real hard. I let newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them. <SEP> That's the. And that's like myself. I miss it because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too. I really do. And I don't know. It seems like you can get lost in a book. It's like an escape for me. <SEP> I don't know about you. It's. If I'm really interested in what I'm reading hours can go by. And I look up at the clock and say. <SEP> In fact I'd rather read sometimes than watch T V. I would too. Kind of train your mind. But I think you get out of the habit like you say. You have to kind of set yourself. <SEP> Have you ever read or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS? That was one of the books I read this year. And it's really fast paced and intense. It is a fiction book. But it was ar-. It was one of the best I read. It was real good. And it was one of the few books that. It. Just hurry up and go through without putting down. <SEP> That's the other problem I have. If I start into something and I really enjoy what I'm reading then I have a terrible time getting away from it too. I'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning because I'm so engrossed in it. And then before you know it it's time to get up and go to work. That type of thing. <SEP> That's why. I don't know. I'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that. Even if I'm doing something like an afghan if I'm close to the end sometimes I'll do the same thing. I don't know what you would call it. Maybe I have a problem. I'm sure it's fast or something. <SEP> It's terrible. I really like books that you can get into. And that's that. I know what you mean. I like reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes. I just sleep better or something. You do. You kind of get relaxed. That's true. But. <SEP> I have a lot of craft books that I have too and magazines. I like PEOPLE those things that are about real people. And I like to read about people who made a success of their lives. <SEP> What book have you read that is along those lines that was really good? To give you specific titles I can't. <SEP> How about who. Like I say haven't done it in such a long time. Do you know who it was about? <SEP> I went to uh seminar on. It was by American business. And some of the people. What the heck was his name. I'm trying to think. He's one of the. Paroe. And it was more like. It was tapes and things that they had about him too. How he started out as just a salesman and now he's multimillionaire and that type of thing. And how you have to be aggressive and really want something for yourself and that type of stuff. It's up to you whatever happens in your life. <SEP> It's not up. It's not someone else. You have to do it. And I find that fascinating that people can do that kind of thing. Just make up their minds that that's it. Have this one direction. And then do it. <SEP> Do it. I can't. I'm not that focused on something. I'm off in all directions. <SEP> And I'm not a planner which I wish I was. Kind of off the wall. If someone says do you want to do this tonight and I got a mountain of things to do it's okay we do it. That's all right. <SEP> I know. I know. But I wish I was more the other way. You're more fun though. You're not ridged? I. That's. I like it that way though. I don't want to change that part of me. That's good. <SEP> That's funny. Even though I admire someone who isn't like I am and I wish I could be more that way. But. There may be some schools you could read about and learn. <SEP> That's true. That's true. How many people do you supervise? About twenty. That's not bad. <SEP> That's not bad at all. Do you like your job? Sometimes. <SEP> Sometimes more than others. But. I do. That's important. I've been there about three years. <SEP> Do you have a family? I just got married last year. And most of my family's in Indiana. So I've only been in Texas three years. <SEP> Do you like it? I do. I love the weather down here. I loved Abilene too. That's what I liked too is the weather. I know. <SEP> Except for tornados. They have storms here. I've. They do. And it's so surprising how it just happens. Hail and thunder and. <SEP> Unpredictable. Were you here during the hailstorm two years ago? <SEP> I've been up here about three. We were down there from eighty-five to eighty-six. Ei-. Part of eighty-four to eighty-six I should say. I had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car. A lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail. I think State Farm went bankrupt. Just about. <SEP> But. I know the whole situation is bad up here. We're having a terrible time with the recession. <SEP> It's not good at all. I know things are pretty booming down there. I heard they sold Johnson City though. And Colorado Springs. <SEP> And Colorado Springs? I talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day. And he was telling me about it. They just sold it. <SEP> Amazing. Closed up and moved down to McKinney. That's good. At least they kept the business part of it. <SEP> It's scary though I'm telling you. I know. I don't know. And the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family. How do I feel what? <SEP> That books influence. Do you know how to use them in your life or to influence. I feel like it's important for young children to read too. And what you read to them. <SEP> When my children were younger of course. They were all married and grown. And I have grandchildren now. They were. I read to them a lot. That's good. And I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also. That's re-. <SEP> I'm not saying they read all the right things. But they do read. Where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all. And I think it's important. Because even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens they don't learn anything. It's because they can't read. It's really surprising how many people graduate from high school that I work with. <SEP> And people. I get memos all the time across my desk. And things are misspelled. And It's pretty sad. It's unbelievable. <SEP> Isn't it? A lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read. <SEP> Exactly. And I think that that's why reading is so important. Because I think even mentally when you can do some.
