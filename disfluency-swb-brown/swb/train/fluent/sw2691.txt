Jay where do you live in Texas? I live in Dallas. In Dallas. <SEP> Right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state. And it goes east and west and a north south tollway. What's that the I Thirty and Central express? It's. It's called Six Thirty-Five's the highway. <SEP> It's the looper that goes around the city. <SEP> And then the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway. Just moved here about a month ago after twenty-one years two miles to the east. Is that right? <SEP> How about that? So it's a very different house from the typical Dallas house. It's a new home? <SEP> It's about eight years old. About eight years. <SEP> It's a duplex type thing. Very modern and very open and light. <SEP> So it's different than the long Texas ramblers. We live in a brick story and a half. <SEP> What's your house like? Cape Cod style I guess you'd call it. And have a big sun room on the back of it. <SEP> So it's got a lot of openness and light also? It doesn't? It doesn't have. <SEP> That's what my wife really wanted. And so. With openness and light? That's. I understand that. I would love that too. <SEP> Our last house wasn't too bad. But it was just too traditional. And so if. This is very traditional. <SEP> The next time probably a year and a half from now we're going to try to build. So make one really contemporary and very modern and very open and very light. Do you have children at home? <SEP> I have three in college. Three? They usually get back at least two of them for the summer. But. You still need space plenty of space. <SEP> Still need a little bit of space. We have a lot less than we had recently. <SEP> Already cut back. <SEP> How big is your place? It's about twenty-five hundred square feet I guess. That's good size. <SEP> It's four bedrooms and two baths and that. We had. It has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room and then the big room on the back. <SEP> We had four bedrooms two and a half baths in the place we just left. <SEP> So now we're down to two and two. Two and two. So it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home. But it won't be that long because we not sure. <SEP> I was just reading an article that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas for sale by the Resolution Trust Corporation? Repossessed. <SEP> And if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal. I guess so. <SEP> We really didn't go that route and didn't look. But the planning of them. And the housing market probably still going to even go lower. There are many houses for sale just by the regular route. That's discouraging if you own property. <SEP> And we just decided sell. And we got a pretty good price for what we had. Not as good as it would have been three or four years ago. Few years. <SEP> But that was just the timing. Our daughter and son-in-law moved back up here. About a year and a half ago and had their house on the market down there. And they never did sell it. So they stayed six months. And she got her job back and he got a job down there. <SEP> Because. They're not moving very well. <SEP> For sure. And that's a good example of it. They live in Rowlett. <SEP> I know where that is. We've been here for twenty-five years. Have you? I'm from Missouri. And my wife's from Kansas. So I teach at a college here. <SEP> So it's sort of home now. What college are you teaching at? <SEP> I'm at one of the Brook- it's called Brookhaven College. It's one of the community colleges. And it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living. <SEP> So it's very nice very convenient. The only one I know is Richardson. <SEP> Richland College it serves Richardson and Garland. Garland. And that's about nine miles to the east of here. <SEP> So it's good to hear from you. I enjoyed talking to you. And I hope we did them some good on their little computer dealy. <SEP> I hope so. <SEP> And have a good life the rest of it. Thank you. Same to you.
