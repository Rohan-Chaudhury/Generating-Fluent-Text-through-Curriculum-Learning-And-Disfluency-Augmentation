. How do you just figure. It depends upon our weather here. Today was a beautiful day. It was like summer day. It was seventy degrees. So I dressed in a light weight skirt. <SEP> It's a ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it. Because I had some appointments at the office today some interviews. And so I had to dress up anyway. And then I wore heels. <SEP> But when it rains a lot which is has been doing here a lot lately very often wear pants and boots. How do you dress? I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now. <SEP> When I was a teacher in Utah I would generally wear dresses and heels and things like that. And even when it rained and snowed I just braved it. And I wore heels anyway. <SEP> And. I can see. I've been a teacher so has my daughter. And I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring. I know. <SEP> It might kill you to go up and walk up to the door. That's right. But you're going to look nice for the kids. <SEP> That's right. And it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids? I need all the height I can get. I do too. So to be taller than some of the boys in the older grades I had to wear heels. <SEP> We too. If it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots. But then I would change into heels as soon as I got to my desk. So. <SEP> Of course we wear an unlined boots. It has a heel on it. They're the kind of boots that I wear to work. And we wear them. They're a leather boot that you wear. And as I said they have a regular heel on them high heel. And we wear them a lot with shirts and things. It's kind of a. I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots. They're not a cowboy boot. But they're just a real pretty boot. But they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain. <SEP> As I have a private high school that I run here when I'm interviewing a parent of course I feel like I need to wear heels and look like I'm a business person. Because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often. <SEP> <SEP> Of course you probably wear coats a lot. The first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it. So I did. So then you had to. And then the third year we got heating. So it was nice. <SEP> Then things improved. But of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot. That's nice. <SEP> And that's very seldom. It depends upon our winter. We have a few days you might wear a winter coat. But most of the time you can wear a sweater. And we just don't wear coats much. We often laugh about even when it turns chilly. We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that. It's really different. Let's put it that way. Are you not teaching anymore? We moved to Iowa. And I'm working at a day care right now. <SEP> I see. And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to twenty months. So you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet. I wear tennis shoes and jeans and things that are sort of. <SEP> More practical. Not. It doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something. <SEP> When you were teaching did you ever have a blue jean day or anything like that? But I never wore jeans because I thought that was too casual. For. <SEP> I know that some of the schools they have country western day or something like that one or tacky day. And I always thought it got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too. It's all right for the students. They look tacky a lot. But I didn't think teachers should. That's how I feel too. <SEP> Do you like Iowa? There's some good things about it. But I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet. Where did you live before? We lived in Utah before. And I grew up in California. <SEP> That's quite a change from California to Utah.
