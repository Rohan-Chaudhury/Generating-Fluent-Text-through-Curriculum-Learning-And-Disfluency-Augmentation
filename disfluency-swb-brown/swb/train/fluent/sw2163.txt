. I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute. <SEP> Credit cards that's an easy topic. Isn't it. <SEP> It is. It's one we all hold dear and near I'm sure. I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them. Most of mine's been pretty good although I guess I'm like a lot of other people now. I'm trying to pay off my credit cards. And I've done pretty good at it. I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want. Not need want. <SEP> <SEP> There is a big difference. There's a big difference there. But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline. <SEP> I do that. I do that. Like I said the rest of them I've been trying to pay off and get back on a cash basis except for gas. It's too easy to run into the gas station. It sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way. <SEP> And. At least that's for me. <SEP>. But. I've talked to some who's really had some bad experience. And I haven't yet not bad. <SEP> That's. I'm just shocked at the end of the month to see what damage I have did. But I try to keep it pretty reasonable. <SEP> I've been pretty lucky in that respect. Like I say I've been trying to not charge except for emergencies. <SEP> But I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards. There's. They have wonderful features. They're there when you need them. Like in emergencies or whatever. And then they have bad drawbacks too. High interest. <SEP> It's awfully easy. It's like paying twice. That's true. That's true. So. <SEP> I try to. I did switch to one sponsored by the credit union though. That seems to be a pretty low interest. Compared to some of the other ones. <SEP> And you don't have an annual fee there. And that helps. We used to have several. But right now we're just more or less at American Express. And that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in. <SEP> That's one way to do it because that forces you to pay for it instead of saying I'll just pay on it this month. Pay fifteen. <SEP> And. I know. And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time. <SEP> Takes a long time. That's right. It sure does. And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax that's. <SEP> Of course it's been going down for a number of years. But this is the last year you can take anything. So. I've enjoyed talking to you. <SEP> I've enjoyed talking to you. And maybe we'll get to talk again. <SEP>
