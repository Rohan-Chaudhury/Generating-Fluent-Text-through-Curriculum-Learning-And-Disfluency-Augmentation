Tell me about your home. Right now we're living in. It's me my wife and two young boys. And right now we're in either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it. <SEP> So we don't have a big yard. But when my wife and I first moved in it was just the two of us. So it was enough. And it's what they call a story and a half. Because it's not a full two story. Where everything on top is on bottom. <SEP> So it's got real high ceilings on half the house. And the other half is just standard sized ceilings. And it's about a five year old house now. It sounds nice. <SEP> It's pretty nice. Unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already. It was a. Landmark is the one who built it. These guys that gambled high lost big. <SEP> That's true. And I'm insulating myself from that problem. <SEP> Exactly what happened to them. I'm building my own house. That's nice. And as I look out the window of my trailer I can envision all the insulation that's going up today. <SEP>. Are you doing it yourself? <SEP> I used to be a builder. That's nice. And I retired about five years ago and started college. <SEP> I see. And now I'm a college educated builder. There's still no work. <SEP> So I decided this summer that we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials. So I did. That's great. And the state has a law that says you can not borrow the money to build your own home. <SEP> R-. Is that so? I didn't know that. You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house. But you can't borrow the money to build your own. That sounds kind of dumb. It's to protect the banks from guys that say I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home. <SEP> And then it doesn't sell. And then the bank's holding the bag. <SEP>. As you know anything that involves the government works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. <SEP> That's right. Hence the savings and loan problem we have. That's true. But my home is fairly simple. It's designed to be added on to. <SEP> That's good. I figure it's just me and my wife. But I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot. So I want to have a shop. <SEP> How big a lot do you got it on? Ten acres. That's nice. That's real nice. It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor. He's on the other side of a hill. <SEP> And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. Seriously. <SEP> That's pretty good. In the winter time I can see another guy. But he's. I can just make out his place. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north. <SEP>. And. <SEP> That's pretty good. I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the house has no heating or air conditioning. <SEP> You don't plan on putting any of that in? It's got a very small furnace. And we'll use a wood burning stove as well. <SEP> But in the house itself I've been working inside lo- these many months. And I have not had to use the heat. <SEP> Because it's all geothermal. That's pretty good. And with all the. I've got. On the south side is all glass. As much as I could get in it. And the east side is glass. <SEP> I've got one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. So it's almost all glass. And. <SEP> My wife would love that. There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows. She loves lots of windows. <SEP> That's great. So. Is it a single story? Not really. It's on the side of a hill. <SEP> I see. So the first. The. Residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep. <SEP> I see. And the side that's on the other side is about six feet high. So I've got a pretty good grade there. <SEP> And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop. <SEP> That's kind of like a Victorian style? I've always liked that. The. We don't have much yard. But I built a small deck in the back. <SEP> But I see these magazines where dig your own deck. I kind of wish I had them those size property and one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
