Personally I don't have any children. I'm twenty-two. And I'm doing my Master's at N C State. So children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now. <SEP> Would they. How do you spend the time with your children? Both of mine are boys. They're eight and eleven. <SEP> And did. And they're into sports. <SEP> As a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight. What are you doing? Baseball has started. Does the eight year old play baseball? <SEP> We start here at five. And in his league do they have a pitcher. Or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what? Up until. It's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May. <SEP> So he's going to be with regular pitching. And my eleven year old of course is pitching. I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York. <SEP> So. But. We're into baseball. And it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball. We even have peewee basketball here. <SEP> There's always something. And how about on the weekends. Do you do sports. Or do you go out? Both. If we're not doing sports we go somewhere. Do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off? <SEP> In the summer or in the Easter time around now? Usually in the summer time. And where do you go? <SEP> Different places every year. We. Have you been out of the country? First they always say get to know your country first before you leave. I lived in places like. <SEP> When I lived in Washington D C I never went to the Washington Memorial. And then when I went back to visit I went to the Washington Memorial. I've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often. And that must be the thing. They really hadn't either. They went to the Memorial. When they go it's on business. <SEP> It's not really just getting to sight see. It's a beautiful city. I bet it is too. But the problem is first time I went out of here they took me to Las Vegas. <SEP> And that was the most boring place on earth. My husband and I we go different places. But when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close. Did you go to Disneyland? <SEP>. But now I don't know. But let's see. When I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean. That was fun. That was. And then after that I. My sister lives in Turkey. So when I was fourteen fifteen I went to Turkey. <SEP> And this Christmas I went to Turkey. But basically it's a. For the past couple of years I. Since my parents are. I'm from Argentina. And my parents live down there. So all the traveling I do is alone. And we were never much of. A very family thing made go skiing in Vermont or something. <SEP> That was a lot of fun. But what happens is we used to fight a lot. So there's never much of a family thing. One of those hell family vacations. <SEP> But I try. My husband also we're involved in everything our kids does. Because my dad died when I was less than a year old. <SEP> So I always just had a mother. So I always thought when I have kids I really want to be involved with them. My dad all he wanted to do was get money for us. So he could buy us material things. Material things. That is. And to me it's now I'm twenty-two. But I still feel. It's we never threw a football or something. <SEP> And the way I was brought up. And he wants me now. He wants to be best friends now. Best friends now. And it's very hard for me. Because it's like you grow up to be twenty years old. And it's always the same man. <SEP> And then suddenly he sees that he's getting old. And he wants to be best friends. But it's I can only express myself so much. Because everything that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say I'm sorry. It's I love you. And let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it. <SEP> And so that's that whole thing that he'll say when. I've seen my uncle and his family does everything together. And his kids are. When his little girl was five years old and everything they would go to the beach. And she could go to sleep at two in the morning. <SEP> And I was brought up the same way. It doesn't matter what age you have. Just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up. But what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house. <SEP> You have to. You honestly do. I have friends that I love to death. And they have children. But their children does anything. We have to take them to do it. <SEP> And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while. Because you're saying I work full time too. But it's just something that. My theory is when you have kids and all you want to do. What I'll do is. You might have problems. But it's not your kids' problems. And you got to try to be with them as much as you can. And to. Thing is that if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying I got a problem. <SEP> Problem. And that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time. First of all you're coming to me. And let's see how we can get rid of the problem. And that's very hard to do. Because once you're best friends with your parents then I think everything go a lot better. <SEP> I agree with you very much so. We waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college. And we knew time wise and money wise too. It would not have been a good idea to had them then. My father was raising three kids before he had me. So it was. You're trying to support four kids. And it's pretty hard. <SEP> And I told him you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids. He says yeah. But then I wouldn't have you. I go yeah. But then you would have a lot of money. <SEP> That's right. But you can't take this money with us though. That's how I keep looking at it. But four children is expensive especially for me which I'm paying out of state tuition. I'm paying three thousand. What is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester. <SEP> And people say it's expensive to think it's college. But if everybody would be a little bit responsible. It's. What does it cost. It costs five hundred dollars a semester. They go to a state college. And they live at home. And it costs two hundred dollars for books. But seven hundred dollars a semester. A lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead. <SEP> If you can. It's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college. <SEP> What are you learning to be? Excuse me? What are you wanting to do after you get out of college? I'm doing computer engineering. <SEP> That's. My husband's into computers. And now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home. Because since I'm an international student they want to send me back to Argentina. <SEP> My dad wants me to go back. So. And you don't want to? <SEP> Because if you go back there then you can never get out. You don't have any money to get out. <SEP> And I was thinking I go back there. And I get married there. And now I have kids there. And then I'll never leave the place. Then you'll never leave. I know. And that's what happened to my brother. He came to school up here. And then when he went down there. He was just so bad off from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain. <SEP>. So. <SEP> Maybe something will open up for you. I've been calling a lot of companies. There. Some of them are interested. At least for a year and a half I can work. So. <SEP> May-. I've enjoyed talking to you. Same here.
