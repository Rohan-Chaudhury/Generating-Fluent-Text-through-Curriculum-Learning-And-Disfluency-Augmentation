. So what was the last car repair you had? Just recently I was kind of laughing when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because I had to have my radiator flushed. <SEP> And it was getting rusty. And the thing that they forgot to do was to also look at the hose. And I had gone about two days with my new radiator flushed. And the hose burst. So I was stranded out on the highway. Did you crack the block or what? I didn't do that but there seemed to be enough antifreeze left to do that. But it cost me all kind of money to have that repaired after they said they had repaired it. So that was a horrible experience just recently. I see. <SEP> You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though. That can be pretty serious. <SEP> I know. I know. What about you? I guess it's been awhile for me. I'd sa-. It's been about a year. I had the water pump break on my car. <SEP> I was traveling. I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving. And it broke in the middle of nowhere. <SEP> So I had to get it towed and then fixed. And. Big pain. <SEP> I know. I know. Especially when you're out on the highway. That's where I was. Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride. I know living in Dallas we've got bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic. And that was horrible. <SEP> To have the. Your car is fuming. And everything. It's already a hundred degrees. You don't need that too. But my car is getting old. It's about six years old now. So. So is mine. <SEP> So I got it right out of college. And so it's starting to show the wear and tear now. I'm hoping mine gets me through. I got until May until I'm out. So when I cross that one I'll be okay. That was my graduation present to myself. So. That's nice. <SEP> I know. But it's really starting to wear. So I've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car. Go-. Because I don't know if I want to pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown. I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is. And it's not worth it. <SEP> That's true. I agree with you there. So I don't know. Because I need to have it tuned up and replace some of the belts. And I was looking at the. Tires need to be replaced. And so I was thinking just a lot of money. I'm. Might as well buy me a new car for that. I got new tires last winter too. So I'm that's the last major purchase for this thing. It's not worth it. <SEP> You have to in Pennsylvania. You have to really have your car winterized and stuff. We get some killer winters up here in the mountains. <SEP>. So. Lot of snow and a lot of cold. <SEP> Especially don't you have a lot of salt on the ground? At times there's a lot of it. You got to clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance. <SEP> Rust and the body too. I haven't had a big problem with that though. So I've been pretty lucky there. <SEP> I think they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can. That's usually pretty good. You just rinse it off after the winter is over and done with it. <SEP> And go like that so. I usually like to do most repairs on my own though. Do you? Just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't. <SEP>. Plus if something goes wrong I know who to blame. <SEP> I think I'm getting too old for all that. I had four brothers. And they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff. So I can do all that stuff. But I think I'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to go have it done now. So I can get my hands dirty. So. I'm just getting to that age I guess. You just don't have. Your time becomes very precious. So working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore. More fun things to do. <SEP> So. I'm trying to. I just need one. I had two cars there for a while. So I wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run. That's nice. <SEP> And. But it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them. And. So that. One is bad enough. <SEP> One was bad enough. But I think I got rid of the wrong one. I need a lot of repairs done on this one. So. <SEP> That was something else. Are our five minutes up? I was just wondering that. I didn't set the time or anything to. I didn't either. <SEP> Put. This must be a hard category. I guess. Unless you're big do-it-yourselfer. To fix up your own cars and things like that. But I guess they were talking about experiences. I did. My parents live in Ohio. So I do know something about the really cold weather. And I've always lived down here in the south. And I took my car up there to their house. And I guess I had a crack in the block. And when I got up there the car.
