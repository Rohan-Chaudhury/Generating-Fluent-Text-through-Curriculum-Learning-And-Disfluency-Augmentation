What is your favorite kind of music? I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be classical music. Same here. <SEP>. What type of music do you like in the classical area. Or what era do you like the most? I guess I like a wide range. Everything from Baroque through at least some modern music. <SEP> And my wife and I these days are especially into opera. We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now. Do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages? We generally. The places we've gone they sing in the original languages. <SEP> The Dallas opera here normally does I guess. I haven't gotten into that too much because if I don't know the story line and I don't speak the language then I have difficult time comprehending what's going on. One thing that's helped us a lot is that you can buy a lot of these operas now on video tape. <SEP> And so we have quite a collection of those. And you watch them at home. And they have subtitles. So you figure out what's going on after a while. And then you can enjoy it in the theater. But the Dallas opera now has super titles on all their performances I think. <SEP> What is that? They give an English translation on a screen up above the stage. I didn't know that. <SEP> That can help people like me. In fact they even do that for operas sung in English because it is hard to understand the words sometimes. I can understand that. So I'd say Vivaldi is probably my favorite composer. <SEP> I really like Vivaldi. He's definitely one of the top of that era. I like Baroque music. <SEP> I like full body music with brass and winds woodwinds instruments. Course I like also string instruments. And I have two string in my house. Instrument players. Both my sons play string instruments. One plays the cello. And the other one plays the viola. <SEP> So I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year. How old are they? One is thirteen and one is eleven. So they're doing this in school or what? <SEP>. You've got half a string quartet there. <SEP> We're on our way. So I try to enjoy all of it. Since you seem to like Italian music have you ever gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era the period before Vivaldi? <SEP> A little bit. But a lot of the music I don't know about as far as the titles. And I have to listen to it and figure out what I'm listening to. <SEP> I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society. Do you belong to that? I don't. But I think I know what it is. Isn't that a. Can't you get records through that or something recordings? <SEP> You can get recordings. They know have them on compact disc or cassettes or L P -s. And they do a lot of original recordings themselves. I think. <SEP> But they also go to the different composers or the different. What do you call them the guys that orchestrate the conductors. <SEP> They go to conductors. And they actually have them perform the music. And they record it. So they're actually commissioned performances. A lot of them are. <SEP> Or they will find out when they're performing. And they will record the music at that time. And so it is high quality grade music. And of course now they also have a jazz section. And they also have a more contemporary and American composer section. <SEP> I had heard good things about the Music Heritage Society. But if I get involved in one of those things I end up spending all my money on music. <SEP> You can control it. I almost bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago. My roommate signed me up. He got a bonus record. And I got a lot of bills. <SEP> I see. So we have to watch that. That's good. Do you play any instrument yourself? <SEP> I play guitar and early years played saxophone.
